https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/sports/football/anthem-kneeling-sports.html,The Anthem Debate Is Back. But Now It’s Standing That’s Polarizing. None As games return and dozens of players drop to one knee  leagues that once tried to tiptoe around the issue won’t be able to avoid it. None Supported by None A strange thing happened while most professional sports were away  shuttered by the coronavirus. The stand-or-kneel debate  sparked by Colin Kaepernick’s posture during the national anthem in 2016 and smoldering since  has reignited — bigger than before  and this time with an unexpected twist. Today  athletes may have to explain why they chose to stand  not kneel  during “The Star-Spangled Banner.” None None Now the issues  and the gesture  have volleyed back to the sports world. The past couple of years  most athletes avoided getting caught up in it. They could blend into the background  behind league protocols for standing or amid the quiet comfort of others. Even most of those considered leaders and allies to Kaepernick  in places like the N.F.L. and the N.B.A.  found reasons not to kneel. The difference in 2020  as sports begin to emerge from their pandemic suspensions  is that nearly every professional athlete will be forced to choose a posture. “You cannot sit around now in this post-George Floyd period we’re in and say  ‘We’re going to continue to take this safe position ’” Ross said. “No. Either you have an issue with racism or you do not.” Rachel Hill  a soccer player  found out first. When the National Women’s Soccer League started its season last Saturday night  Hill’s Chicago Red Stars and their opponents lined up for the pregame national anthem. Most players took a knee. None Not in 2020. Days later  after a barrage of online criticism and debate  Hill felt compelled to defend her body position in a lengthy statement  foreshadowing what awaits most athletes as the games resume. None None None The discussion is sure to spread as more leagues plan to restart  and as more players kneel  and it is destined to resume its outsized place in political discourse as the fall elections approach. It may even end  at least in some leagues  the long American tradition of playing the national anthem before sporting events. When Major League Soccer resumes its season on Wednesday inside a so-called bubble in Florida  it will not play a pregame anthem  ostensibly because there will be no fans. But league officials also have discussed ending the practice permanently when teams return to their home cities. “Which in itself would cause consternation on many sides ” Burin said. None None None None None Others appear to be bracing for the issue to return  but without a firm stance. In the N.B.A.  which is planning to quarantine itself at Disney World in Florida this month to complete its season  Commissioner Adam Silver has been noncommittal about how the league will handle the likelihood of players kneeling for the anthem. The league has had a stand-only policy for decades  he pointed out to Time magazine recently. “I also understand the role of protest  and I think that we’ll deal with that situation when it presents itself ” Silver said. Major League Baseball  which hopes to begin a shortened season later this month  had only one player kneel in 2017. It took no clear stance then. Its abstinence may be tested this month. None “We  the National Football League  admit we were wrong for not listening to N.F.L. players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest ” he said. It all promises to make the anthem must-watch television again this fall. And with bleachers and bar stools still mostly off limits  the patter will ricochet mostly through social media. That is what happened with the N.W.S.L.  where the anthem threatened to overshadow the league’s season openers last weekend. “It’s so interesting  the importance that kneeling has assumed ” Burin said. “Why this particular gesture? Why is that so important  as opposed to putting your hand on someone’s shoulder or bowing your head?” None “Currently  every time the national anthem is played  our country continues to become more and more divided on what the visual symbol of unity looks like ” they wrote. “Through our continuous conversations we wanted to make sure that whatever we decided to do  it would not be an empty gesture.” Among those conversations  they said  were emotional ones with Hill  who had stood next to them  literally. None “I chose to stand because of what the flag inherently means for my military family members and to me  but I 100% support my peers ” she wrote. She added: “I support the black lives matter movement wholeheartedly. I also support and will do my part in fighting against the current inequality. As a white athlete  it is way past due for me to be diligently anti-racist.” Hill tried to have it both ways. But if there is anything certain about the anthem debate  renewed and turned inside-out in these nuance-free times  it is this: There is little room for such posturing. Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/sports/basketball/coronavirus-sports-restart.html,Sports Are Returning. Virus Cases Are Rising. How Many Is Too Many? Advertisement Supported by Leagues are setting up bubbles and writing safety protocols  but as long as the coronavirus continues to surge across the country  their seasons remain at risk. None It wasn’t supposed to happen this way. None None None The challenge for those still plotting a return  experts say  is that much is ultimately beyond the control of any league  team or executive  all of whom are at the mercy of the rising national infection rates — and those in their home cities. “I’m less optimistic about sports coming back as time goes on ” said Melissa Nolan  an epidemiologist at the University of South Carolina. “It’s hard to justify a resumption of sports when we are still struggling to open up basic services.” None If the past 10 days are any indication  this is all about to get more complicated. M.L.B. teams will be hopscotching the country by the end of July  and already players are taking a pass. Ryan Zimmerman of the Washington Nationals said Monday that he would opt out of the season. His teammate Joe Ross  his former teammate Ian Desmond  now with Colorado  and Mike Leake of the Arizona Diamondbacks have also said they will not play. None None None “People want to know why we haven’t been able to have sports back sooner ” said Zachary Binney  a sports epidemiologist at Emory University in Atlanta. “It’s because we don’t have the virus under control.” The result is a situation that appears to become more uncertain each day. “We are bringing sports back not without fingers crossed and pinning our hopes on the idea that things will go OK ” said Neel Gandhi  a colleague of Binney’s at Emory’s School of Public Health. “But the past week has shown we are still very vulnerable. We might be worse than we were a month or two ago.” None None Football players don’t report to training camp until the end of July in a normal year  by then  there should be some initial lessons from what other leagues have gone through  including those that have restarted or plan to in restricted environments — so-called “bubbles” — and those  like baseball  that will not. The early reviews from inside the M.L.S. bubble have been positive. Teams began arriving in Orlando  Fla.  last week. The San Jose Earthquakes were first because they had not been able to practice as a full squad in the team’s home market. Tommy Thompson  a San Jose defender  said during a video conference Friday that players were largely staying in their rooms when they were away from the field. There  he said  they read  watch movies or play video games  and then gather for team meals inside the Disney resort the league has taken over for the next month. For the moment  players said  everyone is aware of the potential consequences of venturing outside the restricted areas under the league’s control. “I feel as safe as I could possibly be ” said Chris Mueller  a forward for Orlando City S.C. “I feel safer here than I was at home.” Still  the point at which a surge in infections on any team  or league  crosses some yet-to-be established coronavirus red line is still unclear. Binney said if three or four players on a team test positive  the leagues should view it as a sign of an outbreak and shut down the team for a period of time. But how many teams have to be shut down for a league to call off its season isn’t clear. “If you don’t set a red line you are giving yourself an excuse  when a lot of money on the line  to push it farther than you should ” he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/sports/ncaafootball/mississippi-flag-ncaa.html,How College Sports Spurred Mississippi to Seriously Reconsider Its Flag Advertisement Supported by Time and again  debate over the state’s flag and its Confederate battle imagery faded away. Then college sports leaders threatened to take away some of the biggest games. None None None None “It hits home with a lot of people because a lot of people follow sports in Mississippi ” Gunn  a Republican who was a walk-on football player at Baylor  said in an interview on Friday. “It was kind of a shot across the bow to say  ‘Wake up  people: There are real consequences here that are going to happen if you continue to maintain this flag.’” Lawmakers could vote as soon as Saturday on a measure to change the flag  and officials said that the margin of any vote  whenever it comes  would likely be close  particularly in the Senate. But regardless of the outcome  it is clear that the college sports industry has helped shape the state’s deliberations  accelerating and elevating a debate that many thought would fade away this year  just as it had in one legislative session after another. For the flag’s critics  the threats that the N.C.A.A. and the SEC would withhold hosting privileges for lucrative national and conference tournaments became tangible examples of the economic perils of preserving the flag. And in a state that cherishes college baseball and football  the warnings may have eased the way for other influential institutions to condemn the flag with less isolation and  perhaps  fewer repercussions. “It gives you the ultimate cover  it’s not unlike the Catholic Church in Italy — it’s a powerful force ” said Stuart Stevens  a Republican strategist who grew up in Mississippi and wrote “The Last Season: A Father  a Son  and a Lifetime of College Football.” None Then this month  with the nation in renewed turmoil over endemic injustice  college sports officials faced new questions  especially from student-athletes  about the Confederate flag. None The deliberations crystallized into plans late last week. Last Thursday morning  during a call with the leaders of his conference’s 14 universities  including Mississippi and Mississippi State  Sankey told campus officials of his planned warning. “I came from the perspective that it was the right statement to make ” Sankey said. “I didn’t move with the expectation that other organizations would follow.” But N.C.A.A. officials  who had just been urged by current and former student-athletes in Mississippi to take a more forceful approach to the flag  were planning a similar discussion for Friday morning  when the association’s Board of Governors was scheduled to convene. In that meeting  the board unanimously agreed to abandon a crucial exception in its policy on Confederate symbolism: that states  regardless of their ties to the battle flag  could hold championships if their teams’ performances earned them a sufficiently high seeding or ranking. Mississippi  the N.C.A.A. noted tartly in its announcement  was the only state that stood to be penalized under the rule change. “The moment focused everyone’s attention on all of those things that could and should be done to increase inclusiveness and make sure we’re being attentive to issues of equality and social justice ” Mark Emmert  the N.C.A.A. president  said in an interview. In Mississippi  where Oxford and Starkville hosted games in the Division I baseball tournament last year  the N.C.A.A.’s rewritten policy was quickly judged as potentially costly. Keith Carter  the athletic director at Mississippi  which lowered the flag in 2015  said his school generally netted at least $200 000 when it hosted part of the baseball tournament. The hospitality industry in Oxford  with its population of about 28 000  also benefited from tens of thousands of visitors. The ultimatums  Carter said  “opened up a conversation that maybe people were a little hesitant to get involved in.” None The warnings from college sports figures may not have shifted opinions  but they helped prompt people to let “their views be known ” Gunn said. In a striking display on Thursday  many of the state’s leading coaches — many of them rivals under more ordinary circumstances — walked the Capitol’s corridors  lobbying lawmakers who were often alumni and fans. “This is a moment in our society for us to reassess values and to do the right thing by removing this symbol of hatred ” said Nikki McCray-Penson  the women’s basketball coach at Mississippi State. Surveying the fast-changing landscape from afar on Friday  Emmert  a political scientist by training  suggested that he saw echoes of history in Mississippi. “Social movements are almost always nonlinear  and they build and they build and they build ” he said. “I think having the N.C.A.A. weigh in on this is just another one of those factors that becomes a catalyst that accelerates something.” This week  though  Carter appeared frustrated that outsiders ever had to speak up  that they had the need to threaten punishments. “You hate ” he said  “that it has to come to that for your state to take notice.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/sports/baseball/coronavirus-fans-return.html,Fans Want Sports. Sports Want Fans. But It’s Not That Simple. None Americans are eager to have their favorite sports back. But three months after most leagues shut down  there are only loose plans  good intentions and a nervous hope that it doesn’t go wrong. None Supported by None As much of the nation emerges from the cultural hibernation caused by the coronavirus  with varying degrees of concern and glee  American sports are now thrusting themselves headlong into the recovery effort. It is not going particularly well. None Even in a best-case scenario — and 2020 is where best-case scenarios go to die — there may be nothing that resembles a normal game between now and September. “We have to get our sports back ” President Trump said — in mid-April. Two months later  all American sports have are loose plans and good intentions. For weeks  Major League Baseball could not figure out how to play even a part of a season  creating the possibility that 2020 would be the first year without baseball in 150 years. The N.B.A. wants to quarantine teams in Florida to finish a season in August and perform a two-month postseason beyond that  though some players are balking at such confinement  partly over racial unrest. The N.H.L. has similar ideas for finishing a season that would have ended by now  in a normal year  but nothing is truly scheduled. In tennis  Wimbledon in late June and early July was wiped out. The United States Open in New York has vowed to start on time in late August  but some players do not want to go  raising questions about whether a fanless  star-depleted event is worth the effort. N.F.L. teams are not sure about the start of training camps in July  and the N.C.A.A. has no cohesive plan and no real idea for what the coming seasons in college football or other sports might look like. The collective strategy is largely to cross fingers. “One of my takeaways from all this is that we don’t have uniform risk tolerance in this country ” the University of Washington epidemiologist Steve Mooney said. “I have some fear that people who have a higher tolerance of risk than I do are making these decisions.” There are glints of optimism. Professional golf and NASCAR have returned  though more as made-for-TV events than as anything resembling a collective experience. Fans  desperate to be entertained and discombobulated by the loss of traditional sports cycles  still do not know if there will be games  or if they will be invited to attend them. And as they see clips of normal-seeming games from around the world — soccer in Europe  baseball in Asia  rugby in New Zealand — nothing feels normal at home. When England’s Premier League became the latest to return to the field on Wednesday  with matches at home stadiums but without fans  even that modest reboot looked like a mirage from the American viewpoint. Messages are mixed. Commissioners unveil plans. Scientists inject reality. “The virus doesn’t watch football games ” said George Rutherford  a professor of epidemiology at the University of California  San Francisco. None The risk remains exacerbating the spread of a highly contagious and deadly virus. The reward is entertainment  first on television  someday again in the bleachers and luxury boxes and sports bars. It is also economic. There are billions of dollars to be made and spent. “People who are not sports fans  I could see how they might question if it’s responsible to restart sports  especially when somebody isn’t allowed to restart their job ” said Dawn Comstock  a sports epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health. She and others also wonder about the ethics of spending finite resources on sports — testing  especially — that might be used elsewhere. For now  it is mostly the professional leagues desperately trying to reboot  perhaps setting an example that will flow through colleges  high schools and youth sports. They are navigating those epic concerns while trying to appease their fans and finances  getting mired in politics  logistics and geography. Comstock said she believed rules could be put in place to make most sports safe. Few are asking if those rules can be followed. None None “It’s such a challenge  not just because of the virus  but how we play sports ” Comstock said. “The activities are so ingrained and part of the culture that even when the sport can be played safely  it’s not likely that the participant will be willing to adopt the guidelines needed to do that.” She laughed. “And that’s just the players ” she said. None “Not that I don’t love sporting events  but for me  the risk-reward ratio is wrong ” Mooney said. Rutherford  at U.C.-San Francisco  expects there will be major college football in the fall  partly because there is so much money at stake  and also some fans — spread out  masked  maybe even tested. “Ten  12  15 000 fans  mostly season-ticket holders? Yeah  that strikes me as doable ” he said. “Trying to fill up the Rose Bowl? That’s another issue.” Mooney is more pessimistic. Even classes on most campuses are not certain. “I think it’s unlikely that there will be football games at U.W. in the fall ” he said of Washington  a member of the Pac-12 Conference. “I’d be pretty outraged if I need to teach my class remotely  but the football stadium is filled with people who intermingle.” None The same day  Major League Baseball’s commissioner  Rob Manfred  said he was “not confident” that there would be a 2020 season  a week after saying “unequivocally” that he was “100 percent” sure there would be. The change was foreboding. If professional baseball could not figure out how to play games in the summer  which it has been doing since the 1870s  what hope is there for everyone else? (By Wednesday  Manfred was saying that he and the head of baseball’s players union had reached an agreement for a 60-game regular season  but it still needs the players to sign off.) The N.B.A.’s plans to convene and quarantine at Disney World in July has met some resistance. Players worry about time secluded from family  and the racial turmoil and protests after the death of George Floyd have left some stars  including Dwight Howard and Kyrie Irving  questioning American priorities. “Basketball  or entertainment period  isn’t needed at this moment  and will only be a distraction ” Howard  a veteran player for the Los Angeles Lakers  said. A distraction is precisely the point  at least to some. Sports occupy an elevated place in American culture  and part of the mythology is that they are not just wanted  but needed  especially in times of crisis. That might be a reasonable argument after a terrorist attack or a natural disaster. But it is a thorny one during a pandemic. “We have an obligation to try this ” Adam Silver  the commissioner of the N.B.A.  told ESPN this week. “Because the alternative is to stay on the sideline. And the alternative is to  in essence  give in to this virus.” Despite all the cheery announcements and detailed plans  there remain more questions than answers. How to keep athletes  coaches and staff safely quarantined from the outside world  and the outside world safe from them? What if someone declines to participate? What if someone tests positive? What if a dozen people do? What about the support staff? Mainly  what is the proper ratio of risk to reward in the name of entertainment? None That makes it hard to imagine stadiums filled with opposing teams — never mind thousands of fans — come late August  as scheduled. Never have American sports fans been left without teams to cheer for so long. Back in March  it was the decisive shutdown of the N.B.A.  the halt of baseball’s spring training and the cancellation of the N.C.A.A.’s basketball tournaments that signaled the seriousness of the pandemic to many Americans. The anticipation was a short recess  maybe 30 days. Remember that? Three months later  with Americans looking for plenty of distraction and signals that everything will be OK  the message from sports is that we have no real idea of what the coming months will bring — or which games will be a part of them. The faded hopes of spring hopscotch into a summer of discontent  toward an ever-uncertain autumn. Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/sports/basketball/marc-stein-newsletter.html,Reality Seeps In: Basketball Is Starting  and the Virus Is Still Here Advertisement Supported by Marc Stein On Basketball “It sounded good a month or two ago ” said the Raptors’ Fred VanVleet of the N.B.A.’s restart plan. “Not so much right before we got ready to leave.” None July is supposed to be a magical month in the N.B.A. The mere mention of it evokes images of the feast known as free agency that  as we all understand by now  means as much (or more) to some fans as the games themselves. The calendar flipped Wednesday  but this is 2020  which immediately tells you that the coming month will be unlike any previous July in league history — and presumably no great source of anticipation. The mood of the moment was perhaps best capsulized by Fred VanVleet  whose Toronto Raptors have already convened in Florida to prepare for the 22-team restart of the N.B.A. season at Walt Disney World at the end of July. “It sounded good a month or two ago ” VanVleet said on a Monday conference call  referring to the N.B.A.’s plans to reboot the 2019-20 season in a contained environment on the Disney campus. “Not so much right before we got ready to leave ” he added. The Raptors came together last week at Florida Gulf Coast University because Canada’s mandatory 14-day quarantine rule for anyone who enters the country made it impossible for the N.B.A.’s reigning champions to begin their Disney World preparations in their own practice gym. The rest of the 22 teams are scheduled to arrive next week. Raptors Coach Nick Nurse and Masai Ujiri  Toronto’s team president  have repeatedly insisted that their team has been greeted by a safe environment at the hotel in Fort Myers  Fla.  where they — and no one else — are staying until they can relocate to the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex near Orlando next week. None The disclosures from Dinwiddie and Jordan came one day after a Nets veteran  Wilson Chandler  said that he was opting out of the restart for family reasons and over coronavirus concerns. The Nets have thus emerged as the N.B.A.’s first known test case of a reunited team that must deal with the psychological effects  on top of all the health implications  of an outbreak in their camp. How will teammates  coaches and team staffers react to the news that multiple players have to be quarantined after testing positive? As we’ve been discussing in this newsletter for months now  I’ve long believed that the answer to that question could only be ascertained in real time  when the situation actually materialized. The surprise: The N.B.A. didn’t even make it to the bubble before a team had to face it. General Manager Sean Marks told reporters on Wednesday that the team was still committed to participating in the restart. Yet you can safely presume that the Nets never imagined marking the one-year anniversary of the free-agent commitments they officially received from Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on June 30  2019 — maybe the greatest day in franchise history — in such downbeat fashion. As recently as Friday  N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver and Michele Roberts  the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association  expressed relief on a call with reporters after the league announced that only 16 of the 302 players tested by their teams on June 23 had positive results. Just a few days later  given the Nets’ plight and the Denver Nuggets’ decision to close their practice facility after multiple positive coronavirus tests among unnamed members of their planned Florida traveling party  anxiety is on the rebound. Big time. Positive tests were not a surprise. The two-week stay for teams in their home markets before reporting to Florida  after all  was designed in hopes of isolating as many of those positive cases as possible before anyone arrived at the Disney complex. Yet it is only now  as the possibility of multiple positive tests for any given team has become a reality  that players and other restart participants can gauge how comfortable they are with the enormity of the challenge. Roberts insisted last Friday that the N.B.A. and the players’ union have done “the best we can do to mitigate the risk of an infection on our players and our teams and our staffs.” “If I didn’t feel that  I would be recommending to Chris and to the players to stay home ” Roberts said  mentioning the union president  Oklahoma City Thunder guard Chris Paul. “I feel that  and so I can sleep at night.” The resolve of an entire league is nonetheless being tested daily. July may typically be a magical time in the N.B.A.  and Disney World is certainly supposed to be a magical place  but as VanVleet so aptly put it during Monday’s conference call: “That’s been 2020 for us.” T.O. Souryal  a former president of the N.B.A. Physicians Association who spent 22 years as the Dallas Mavericks’ team doctor  offered a sobering reminder in a chat we had on Sunday. None None “For this population of N.B.A. athletes  the medical risk is very low  but they can infect others who may be much more vulnerable. This is a dangerous virus that can kill. And as long as death is on the table  then the stakes are very high — almost unacceptable  in my opinion. “Adam Silver and those surrounding him are well aware of the stakes. Based on my experience with N.B.A. administrators  I have confidence that they will do the right thing.” None None None None If you have been following along in the newsletter over the past few weeks  you have probably already surmised that I back Dudley’s contention that this is a major issue. The past few months have been nothing like the typical N.B.A. off-season  which should explain why I’ve been bringing up the mere 19-day window teams in Florida will have for five-on-five preparatory play. Even the players who managed to play some unauthorized pickup basketball in May and June as it became apparent that the N.B.A. was nearing a return haven’t played nearly as much as they would have in the month leading up to a typical training camp. So there is no way to compare the hiatus forced by the coronavirus outbreak to anything in the usual N.B.A. calendar. None “After not playing for four months  a few weeks isn’t enough time to get ready and return to playing ” Kalnitis said. “We’re not the only ones who are concerned about this.” It seems reasonable to assume that at least some of Beverley’s pushback was inspired by the animus that flows out of the L.A. teams’ blossoming rivalry. The reality  though  is that there isn’t a team that won’t wish it had more full-speed prep time once the games start. None None There are 88 seeding games in a span of up to 16 days. The league has placed 52 of them on national television. TNT (18) and ESPN (17) are getting 35 of those broadcasts in the build-up to the playoffs  which are scheduled to begin Aug. 17. There will be as many as seven games a day in the early stages at Disney World and  as a bonus  Zion Williamson will have the opening night stage that a knee injury robbed from him in October. Williamson didn’t get to play in Toronto on Oct. 22 in the official season opener  but he’ll obviously be the star attraction when Williamson’s New Orleans Pelicans face the Utah Jazz on July 30 on TNT. The better question  Will  really is: How will we find the time to watch all of these games? None None The jacket  as I wrote previously  is so pristine and gorgeous in the plastic that I can’t even think about wearing it. It’s thus displayed at my house as a treasured time capsule from my teenage and college years — and better days for the Sabres. Alex  my 16-year-old son  taught me a few years ago about the “one to rock  one to stock” philosophy. I’ve been a collector of sports memorabilia for more than 40 years  but I had never heard it put that way until my sneakerhead son educated me on the phrase. I totally subscribe to that maxim now. So I am on the hunt for another Sabres Starter jacket in mint (or gently used) condition that can actually go into my rotation rather than function solely as a home museum piece. Here’s hoping I will be able to reveal in a future newsletter that the Irrational eBay Purchase of the Month is indeed “one to rock.” None None Luguentz Dort’s four-year  $5.4 million contract signed last week with Oklahoma City included only $2.3 million in guaranteed money — widely regarded as a quite favorable deal for the Thunder. Dort began this season on a two-way contract but had secured a spot in Coach Billy Donovan’s regular rotation by the time the N.B.A. season was suspended indefinitely on March 11. Oklahoma City is 16-5 with Dort in the starting lineup. None None None Advertisement ,articles/sports

Later  the team announced that All-Star infielder D.J. LaMahieu and pitcher Luis Cessa tested positive for Covid-19. None Saturday was the Yankees’ first official summer workout  a routine bit of preparation to start their coronavirus-shortened 2020 season. Instead of an ordinary practice at Yankee Stadium  the team witnessed a frightening incident in which a key pitcher was hit on the head with a line drive. And later in the day  it announced that two other players were absent from practice because they had tested positive for Covid-19. Masahiro Tanaka  a two-time All-Star  lay motionless on the ground after being struck with a ball off the bat of his teammate  the slugger Giancarlo Stanton. Tanaka eventually sat up and walked off the field with two athletic trainers by his side. He was released from NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital on Saturday night after being evaluated for concussion-like symptoms. The Yankees also announced positive tests for star infielder D.J. LeMahieu and pitcher Luis Cessa with their permission  as league rules prevent teams from naming players without consent. LeMahieu and Cessa remain isolated at their homes and will need to test negative before traveling to New York to join the team  Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said. LeMahieu has been asymptomatic  while Cessa has shown “very mild” symptoms of the virus. “We’ll see how that continues to unfold the next several days ” Boone said. None But Tanaka had little time to react when Stanton  who hits the ball as hard as anyone in baseball  drilled a line drive toward the mound. The ball struck the right-handed Tanaka on the right side of the head  knocking him to the ground  where he lay for at least five minutes while cradling his head. “It sucks to see something like that  especially during something as simple as a sim game ” outfielder Aaron Hicks said in a video news conference with reporters. None “It’s incredibly unfortunate what happened today ” Boone said. “In a lot of ways  we’re hopeful we avoided something really bad happening.” None Tanaka had been pitching without a so-called L screen  a protective barrier often used during practice sessions. But after seeing Tanaka get hurt  pitcher Jordan Montgomery said he was so shaken up that he requested one  which he had not originally planned on using. “It’s horrible ” Montgomery said  adding later: “I hope he’s OK. I’m thinking and praying for him right now.” Last year  the Yankees set a major league record with 30 players spending time on the injured list. Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/sports/horse-racing/baffert-drug-test-charlatan-gamine.html,Two Horses Trained by Baffert Test Positive for Banned Substances Advertisement Supported by The horses failed tests of a second sample  confirming the presence of an unauthorized local numbing agent. None Two undefeated horses trained by the Hall of Famer Bob Baffert indeed tested positive for a banned substance in Arkansas  a person familiar with the results of the split-sample test said Monday. None None The anesthetic is considered a Class 2 drug by the Association of Racing Commissioners International  and use of it carries a penalty of a 15- to 60-day suspension and a fine of $500 to $1 000 for a first offense. In the absence of mitigating circumstances  the horse would also be disqualified and forfeit its purse. Charlatan earned $300 000 for first place in one of two top races at the Arkansas Derby. Baffert  who had exercised his right to have a second test performed  did not answer phone calls  texts or emails from The New York Times. Lidocaine can be used legitimately for suturing wounds or as a diagnostic tool to determine whether horses are sound enough to compete. The drug may also be present in ointments or creams used on cuts or abrasions. It is regulated because of its potential to mask lameness in an unsound horse. Officials from the Arkansas Racing Commission did not answer phone calls from The Times. In May  however  Alex Lieblong  the chairman of the Arkansas Racing Commission  told The Times it would schedule a hearing as soon as the second test came back. “When we get it  there will be no delaying tactics ” he said. “Anything we can expedite  we will do.” Four days after Charlatan’s runaway victory in the $500 000 Arkansas Derby  the colt’s stallion rights were sold for an undisclosed sum to Hill ‘N’ Dale Farm. The colt missed the Belmont Stakes with an ankle injury  and Baffert has said he will miss the Kentucky Derby  as well. Charlatan may be able to come back in time for the Preakness on Oct. 3. None California racing officials investigated the failed test for four months  allowing Justify to keep competing long enough to win the Triple Crown. In August  after Justify’s breeding rights had been sold for $60 million  the California Horse Racing Board — whose chairman at the time  Chuck Winner  had employed Baffert to train his horses — disposed of the inquiry during a rare closed-door session. The board ruled that Justify’s positive test for the banned drug scopolamine had been the result of “environmental contamination ” not intentional doping. Baffert has denied any wrongdoing  but the quantity of the drug found in Justify suggested that it was present not because of contamination in his feed or his bedding but rather because of an effort to enhance performance  according to Dr. Rick Sams  who ran the drug lab for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission from 2011 to 2018. Mick Ruis  the owner of the second-place horse in the Santa Anita Derby  is in litigation with California officials to have his colt Bolt d’Oro declared the winner and awarded the $600 000 first-place check.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/sports/football/cam-newton-new-england-patriots.html,Can Cam Newton Be Superman Again? None Newton went from paradigm-shifting M.V.P. to discarded free agent. Joining the New England Patriots could give him the perfect relaunch. None Supported by None Third-and-10 is traditionally a passing situation  but just outside the red zone on that down  Cam Newton took the shotgun snap  glanced left  tucked the ball and charged forward. Evading a thicket of bodies  he cut right and accelerated toward the sideline. Even then  five years into Newton’s career  defenders seemed confounded that someone that big — 6-foot-5 and 245 pounds — could also be that fast. He outraced one defender  then shoved another  jolting him five yards with a hellacious stiff arm  to gain the first down. Jumping up  Newton spiked the ball and flexed. On the next play  after shedding a tackle  he raced 12 yards into the end zone  somersaulting over his center  for the second of his four touchdowns in the Carolina Panthers’ N.F.C. championship game rout of the Arizona Cardinals in January 2016. He did his “Superman” celebration and then dabbed  performing the head-to-bent-elbow dance move as the home crowd at Bank of America Stadium roared. None In a league where teams pay millions of dollars for even average quarterback play  what has happened to Newton this off-season would have seemed incomprehensible in 2015. With a new coach and after gutting the roster  the Panthers released Newton in March  having decided that he no longer fit into their plans. None Newton spent three months unemployed as the coronavirus pandemic prevented teams from gauging his health before the New England Patriots signed him to a one-year contract reportedly laden with performance incentives. In less than a month  Newton  31  who is two years removed from his last healthy season  will arrive at Patriots training camp seeking to answer for himself the same question wondered by a vast legion of football fans: Can he be Superman again? None In his debut  he passed for 422 yards and accounted for three touchdowns. The next week  he threw for 432 and rushed for 53 more. The Panthers lost both  but it almost did not matter. They had Newton  and no one else did. He primped. He preened. He moped. He pointed after first downs. He barreled into defenders. He ran and threw for lots of yards and scored lots of touchdowns and had lots of fun  charming some fans and irritating others with his demonstrative personality. Categorized as a mobile quarterback or a dual threat — descriptions  rooted in racial stereotypes  suggesting he doesn’t throw as well as he runs — Newton abhorred labels. He played the position how he wanted to  how he knew he could. “Cam was like  ‘I’m bringing my full self here ’” said Louis Moore  the author of “We Will Win the Day: The Civil Rights Movement  the Black Athlete and the Quest for Equality” and an associate professor of history at Grand Valley State University. “It opened up everything for others to follow — the way he dressed  the way he talked  the way he moved ” Moore said. “We hadn’t really seen any of that. The quarterback’s always been told that he has to act a certain way  this kind of professional level — you can’t be a diva wide receiver — and Cam flipped the script: ‘No  I’m going to be who I want to be.’ And plus  he was really  really good.” None “When he walks into a room  man  it’s just  ‘Oh  my God ’” said Chris McClain  a longtime radio host in Charlotte  N.C.  who  he joked  has a Ph.D. in Cam-o-logy. “He has a presence  and he likes that. He’s always said that ‘I’m not going to be your typical quarterback — I’m going to be me.’” That attitude was manifested in Newton’s postgame style — his ostentatious hats and garish suits have furrowed brows — as much as in his on-field fearlessness  his willingness to initiate contact and jeopardize his body  even as coaches urged him to slide. Considering all that Newton could do on the field  he seemed at times burdened with offsetting Carolina’s roster imperfections  from its modest offensive line to its meager cast of receivers. The Panthers won three consecutive N.F.C. South titles  culminating with that 2015 season that ended with a loss to Denver in Super Bowl 50. “I don’t think  at times  we maybe surrounded him with the best players ” said the former quarterback Derek Anderson  who backed up Newton for seven seasons. “But we could get away with it because of his ability.” As a runner  Newton was nonpareil  perhaps the best short-yardage and red-zone threat the N.F.L. has ever seen. But as electrifying as he was as a passer  his inconsistencies trailed him even during his best seasons. That is  until 2018  when he flourished under the new offensive coordinator Norv Turner’s short-passing game. That season  he leapt into the rare air of the game’s tacticians  finishing with a 67.9 percent completion rate  ninth among starters. Just as he was thriving  though  another set of shoulder troubles surfaced. After having surgery for a torn rotator cuff after the 2016 season  Newton underwent another procedure on the same shoulder in January 2019  eight months after the new owner David Tepper bought the team. Mended by training camp that year  he then injured the Lisfranc ligament in his left foot during a preseason game  an injury that impeded both his mobility and his follow-through. In what turned out to be his final game with Carolina  a Week 2 home defeat to Tampa Bay  Newton completed 49 percent of his passes  and in decisive proof of his limitations  he didn’t run the ball on either of the Panthers’ fourth-and-1 situations in the fourth quarter. Newton’s free agency this spring followed his peers’  as Tom Brady  Philip Rivers and Teddy Bridgewater  who landed with Carolina  all signed contracts that could pay them over $20 million per year. Newton became available on March 24 — when travel restrictions wrought by the pandemic blocked teams from examining him — and lingered on the open market past April’s draft  as viable starting options evaporated. Whether the depressed demand was an absurdity  given his stature  or entirely reasonable  given the general uncertainty about his health  was not clear. If not for the pandemic  one N.F.L. agent said  the market for Newton would have been robust. “But you have to pay a player for what they’re going to be in the N.F.L.  not for what they’ve done ” said the agent  who requested anonymity to speak freely about a player he does not represent. “And you don’t know what he’s going to do.” None None “Obviously  when you’ve been a starter for a long tenure for one team  you can feel out of place when something like this happens to you ” Vick said. “I felt like I should have been starting for a team  based on my résumé and what I’d been able to do until that point  but that just wasn’t the reality. You’re not going to be viewed that way if you have a two-year hiatus or you’re hampered by injuries.” None Newton has not had to prove himself to such an extent since 2009  when he attended Blinn College to regain N.C.A.A. eligibility after flaming out at Florida. He arrived at the campus in Brenham  Texas  without a car or a starting role but parlayed that stopover into an enchanted season at Auburn  where he won the Heisman Trophy and the national championship. None Playing behind the best offensive line of his career  Newton will benefit from the tutelage of the coordinator Josh McDaniels  who  by marrying Newton’s running acumen with his play-action passing prowess  can finally stress defenses in a way that the Patriots’ primary challengers in the A.F.C. — Kansas City  Baltimore  Houston — have done to them. None None If he is healthy  if he plays well in New England  the respect will come. And  perhaps  so much more  from marketing opportunities to touchdown celebrations to postseason berths. For Newton  on the precipice of his second act  discarded and bypassed and overlooked  there is but one direction for him to go: up  up and away. Alain Delaqueriere contributed research.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/sports/basketball/nets-deandre-jordan-injuries-coronavirus.html,A Month Before the N.B.A.’s Restart  the Nets Keep Losing Players Advertisement Supported by The coronavirus and injuries have left the Nets with a depleted roster  raising questions about how competitive they will be when the season resumes in July. None None Eight months later  little has gone according to plan. With about a month to go before the N.B.A. is expected to restart its season at Walt Disney World  the Nets have little more than a skeleton crew to send to play in Florida. Because of injuries  coronavirus infections or concerns over the outbreak  several of the team’s top players have been ruled out of the restart  raising questions about how competitive the team can be when the league returns. The team declined to comment on Tuesday as to whether it would reconsider its plans to participate in the restart. General Manager Sean Marks and the Nets’ interim coach  Jacque Vaughn  are scheduled to speak to reporters on Wednesday. None Without Chandler  Jordan and Dinwiddie  who helped provide a spark after the Nets lost Kyrie Irving to a shoulder injury  the club will be left with a roster that includes talented but developing players like Caris LeVert  Jarrett Allen and Joe Harris  and a handful of minimally established players. None Nicolas Claxton  a rookie power forward who played sparingly  will not be in Florida  either  after undergoing arthroscopic labrum repair surgery  the Nets announced last week. And  finally  the team announced last week that it had waived the reserve guard Theo Pinson. The team has moved swiftly to fill some of the holes in the roster  including adding guard Tyler Johnson  who gave the Miami Heat some scoring punch off the bench in his first four seasons but struggled to fit with the Suns since being traded to Phoenix. None None None There was Irving-related drama as well. After a January loss to the Sixers  Irving told reporters that the talent deficiency on the roster was “glaring” and that the team needed more pieces. None Atkinson had been in his fourth year as the Nets’ coach and had a strong reputation around the league for getting the most out of players on his team.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/sports/basketball/electronic-whistles-referees.html,Is This Whistle the Future of Refereeing? Advertisement Supported by Officiating with a deep breath and a burst of air no longer seems wise in the coronavirus era. Is a hand-held  electronic whistle the answer? None More than 140 years after it made its debut  in English soccer  the whistle is the most recognizable sound in sports. None But in the age of coronavirus  the whistle may face an existential challenge  or  at the very least  a serious rethinking. To use almost any whistle requires a deep breath and then a forced burst of droplet-filled air — things that  during a pandemic  deeply concern medical experts. Is there a better way? That is what people keep asking Ron Foxcroft. Foxcroft  a former N.C.A.A. and Olympic basketball official  is the most trusted name in North America when it comes to whistles. His company  Fox 40  sells about 15 000 a day — mostly the so-called pealess whistle  which accounts for the bulk of his business. About a decade ago  Fox 40 also began making and marketing an electronic whistle. It operates with the push of a button  and its tones can be adjusted by a switch on the side. The current versions on the market produce sounds that range from 96 to 120 decibels (or from the sound of a lawn mower to that of an ambulance siren). It is this version that in recent months has come to dominate Foxcroft’s conversations  emails and text messages. “There’s two questions ” Foxcroft said of the inquiries he has received in the past few months. “No. 1: ‘Ron  you’re a referee. Tell us what you think of the electronic whistle.’ No. 2: ‘We’d like to experiment with the electronic whistle. Can you send us some?’” None Before mid-April  the Canadian company’s largest order for electronic whistles had come from a European train company  which bought 3 000 for its employees. Since May 1  though  Foxcroft estimated  the company had received orders for about 50 000 more. Most are headed to sports officials. Many of the referees who receive them will be trying one for the first time. Verne Harris  a Division I men’s basketball official for the past 32 years  said in an interview that he did not know the electronic whistle existed until this spring. But during his coronavirus-imposed refereeing hiatus  he said  he has been pondering what changes might be coming to the profession. “I didn’t really think of anything that would be an alternative  but I was like  ‘How in the world?’” Harris said of the conundrum of reducing transmission risks during games. “The minute they touch the ball and then we touch the ball and then we kick it out and turn around and put the whistle in our mouth. “And when you blow on the whistle ” he added  “then all of those particles are coming out into the air.” None None “Are they weatherproof? Do they work in the snow? Do they work in the rain? You know  those sorts of things ” said Steve Shaw  the national coordinator of officials and secretary rules editor for college football  who tried out Fox’s electronic whistle in May. “And do we have to carry a spare battery around with us?” Other officials wondered how an electronic whistle would be synced with the Precision Time System  a relatively new mechanism that uses the sound of referees’ whistles to stop the game clock. Experts say this system can save 30 seconds or more of playing time during the average 40-minute college basketball game  and it is used in the N.B.A.  the W.N.B.A. and the men’s and women’s N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments. “When you put air in the whistle it triggers the clock to stop at that point like instantaneously ” said Donnie Eppley  a Division I men’s basketball official since 1997. “I’m not sure how they would do that with an electronic whistle.” Shaw said he thought the electronic whistle could be a good alternative if sports officials determined that referees should shift away from traditional models. But the most difficult part in using the new whistle is just that  Shaw explained: using it. He and several other officials interviewed raised concerns about what is considered to be one of the graver sins in their job: the inadvertent whistle. “We have that momentary time lag between taking your whistle from your hand to your mouth  and that little instance sometimes can save you from blowing an inadvertent whistle ” Shaw said. “And this has none of that kind of delay built into it because it’s right there in your hands. And right there  your thumb is on the button. So we’d have to really talk through being patient.” Eppley added: “I can see  maybe  a lot of inadvertent whistles where people are just running up and down the court and you’ve got this thing in your hand and you just inadvertently touch the button.” He called it a challenge of “whistle discipline.” For now  the bigger challenge may be educating the experts tasked with making decisions regarding the return of sports about the electronic whistle’s existence. None But upon learning about the electronic whistle  he became a quick convert. “I hadn’t thought of this  but the idea of this electronic whistle  it actually solves a lot of problems ” Hainline said. “It’s a brilliant idea  in my opinion.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/science/bees-obstacles-collisions.html,How Bees Avoid Bumping Into Nature’s Obstacle Course Advertisement Supported by Trilobites When the garden gets perilous  these pollinators hit the gas. None For a human  a breeze-ruffled garden is a peaceful scene: Dandelion seeds float  leaves rustle and flowers bob their heads. But if you’re a bee  it’s a minefield. For a small creature with delicate wings  airborne seeds  shifting leaves and lurching flowers are basically projectiles  trap doors and Godzilla-tipped skyscrapers. None None For the study  the researchers built a bee obstacle course. They spaced four rods an inch and a half apart on an oscillating platform that could move them back and forth  like swaying stems. They then put the whole setup inside a flight tunnel  with a fan on either end. Honeybee volunteers were recruited from around campus. The researchers had them fly through the course one at a time  in various conditions — in still air  against a headwind  and propelled by a tailwind  and with either stationary or moving obstacles — and filmed their efforts with a high-speed video camera. The bees were then sent home again  unfortunately without prizes. When they went to the tape  the researchers found that the bees’ flight strategy changed depending on the conditions they faced. When confronted with moving rods in still air  they flew more slowly than when they encountered stationary obstacles. “You might interpret that as them being more cautious  because there’s this unexpected thing happening in front of them ” Dr. Burnett said. (In nature  quivering vegetation on a still day might indicate the presence of a predator  or a lawn mower.) But when the wind kicked up — in either direction — the honeybees would “actually speed up how fast they’re flying” by about 50 percent when the rods were moving compared with when they were still  he said. When faced with complex airspace  the bees seemed to act “cautious in still air and courageous in wind ” he said. None As for what accounts for these differing strategies  Dr. Burnett hypothesizes that it might be the same force that makes us run through rainstorms: the need to “get through the obstacles as fast as possible ” he said. This idea was underscored by further analysis  which focused on how successful bees managed to avoid collisions. In still air  slowing down was helpful. But in wind  speed didn’t matter  and a wipeout-free transit was determined by how well the bees aimed themselves as they flew through the rods. That honeybees are using a “grin-and-sprint-through-it strategy” is an intriguing hypothesis  Dr. Clifton said  adding that she would like to see further study focused on whether there was a moment when the bees decided to accelerate. It also reminded her of human competitors on obstacle-course reality TV shows. “If you watch those shows  there are interesting moments when someone who is being cautious and deliberate figuratively throws their arms up  hopes for the best  and just goes for it ” she said. Sometimes that’s the most effective strategy. Advertisement ,articles/sports

On Thursday  the club terminated his contract. “We apologize the result of our initial decision added incremental pain and anger in our community beyond what the incident itself already understandably has to all of us ” the board said. St. John’s University  where Mr. Vaksman had been an assistant coach for the fencing team since 2006  fired him on Wednesday. “As soon as the recording was brought to our attention the matter was immediately investigated and the individual was terminated by the university ” Mike Cragg  the school’s athletic director  said in a statement. “The racist comments expressed are completely unacceptable and a rejection of everything for which the university stands.” Mr. Vaksman did not immediately return requests for comment on Saturday. None In his career  Mr. Vaksman also served as the coach for the United States junior national épée team. None “USA Fencing stands with our black athletes and all underrepresented minorities within the fencing family and will conduct an immediate investigation ” it said. None None “This video is a reminder that coaches and teachers  those people entrusted with building us  educating us  and protecting us  too often perpetuate the discriminatory treatment and behaviors that normalize racism ” she wrote. On Friday  Ms. Muhammad posted an update to her Instagram story  thanking St. John’s and Mr. Cragg for their swift action. “Boris Vaksman is a smaller piece in a larger puzzle of white supremacy in the sport of fencing ” she said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/sports/soccer/manchester-city-champion-league-ban.html,Manchester City Appeals Its Champions League Ban and Awaits Its Fate Advertisement Supported by The English soccer champion will learn in July if its two-year ban has been overturned. But the results of a three-day hearing that ended Wednesday will have repercussions for the sport. None Manchester City  the English Premier League champion  will find out before the end of July whether it has successfully appealed its two-year ban from European soccer’s elite Champions League. The club  which has angrily denied breaking cost-control rules and vowed to fight any punishment  presented its defense during a three-day hearing conducted by the Court of Arbitration for Sport that concluded on Wednesday. Lawyers representing UEFA  European soccer’s governing body  which imposed the ban  defended their decision. None None Such is the sensitivity around the case  though  that little was made public before the hearing this week  including the identity of the three-member panel that heard the appeal  as is customary. The arbitration panel heard the case over video link because of travel restrictions imposed to restrict the spread of the coronavirus. In a statement  it said a verdict would most likely be announced by “the first half of July.” “At the end of the hearing  both parties expressed their satisfaction with respect to the conduct of the procedure ” the court said in an emailed statement. At the heart of the case against City is a claim that it disguised millions of dollars of direct investment by its owner  Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan  as sponsorship income  with one document published by the German news weekly Der Spiegel appearing to show that the team’s main sponsor  the Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways  paid only a fraction of an $85 million sponsorship agreement. City has denounced the use of “out-of-context materials purportedly hacked or stolen ” and it continues to contend that the leaks are part of an “organized and clear attempt to damage the club’s reputation.” The repercussions of the verdict will be significant  Manchester City earns about $100 million a season for participating  and its exclusion — and the loss of those payments — could make it more difficult to retain staff members and players or acquire new ones. But the case could also have consequences for parties beyond Manchester City. Clubs in the Premier League  which will return to action next Wednesday after a shutdown because of the coronavirus  are competing for places in next season’s Champions League  if City is banned  the fifth-best team will take its place in the competition. For UEFA  the stakes are just as high. A Manchester City victory at CAS would raise serious questions about the future of the financial fair play regulations  which were introduced in 2009 as a bid to stem a culture of ballooning losses in European club soccer. The fate of a separate investigation by the Premier League  which has its own spending rules  could also be determined by the result of City’s appeal. None The case has poisoned Manchester City’s relationship with UEFA. Interactions between club officials and UEFA’s investigators are said to have been testy  a point made clear in the statement announcing the ban: It said the club had “failed to cooperate in the investigation.” The bitterness extends to many of the team’s supporters. Manchester City Fans routinely jeer the Champions League anthem on match days  and others have taken to social media decrying what they perceive as unfair treatment of their team by UEFA  which they accuse of siding with more established elite clubs. The club has espoused similar sentiments. Days after UEFA announced its ban  City’s Spanish chief executive  Ferran Soriano  said in an interview broadcast on the club’s website that “based on our experience and our perception  this seems to be less about justice and more about politics.” The ban has no effect on this year’s Champions League  a competition that City has yet to win in spite of years of lavish spending under its Gulf owners. The team is well placed to reach the quarterfinals after defeating Real Madrid in the away leg of their two-game round of 16 series. UEFA expects the competition to resume in August  after the conclusion of the rearranged domestic league schedule. Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/paintball-george-floyd-protests.html,The Latest Police Tool in Protests: Paintball Guns Advertisement Supported by They are essentially no different from the ones used recreationally  but the projectiles carry hidden risks when fired at unsuspecting people who lack the protective gear that gamers use. None None Essentially no different than the ones a gaming enthusiast would use  paintball guns used by law enforcement compress air to fire small spheres that  upon impact  dispense liquid paint or an irritant powder. While companies that make paintballs guns tout them as safe tools for crowd dispersal  in reality  they carry significant risk. Even some police chiefs are now questioning their use. None The problem is that a paintball gun is associated with pretend war games and is often thought of as an innocuous toy. “The threshold for its use is low ” he said. “You are seeing a lot more of this ” said Chris Burbank  vice president of law enforcement strategy of the Center for Policing Equity  a think tank  and the police chief of the Salt Lake City Police Department until 2015. “It seemed like a broader tactic than I had anticipated.” None Adam Keup said an officer  without warning  shot him in the eye with a paintball gun loaded with a ball of pepper spray at a protest in Omaha  Neb.  in late May. Mr. Keup  23  said doctors told him he would have permanent eye damage and might never be able to see out of that eye again. “I was in a state of shock ” said Mr. Keup  who was hit while he was watching the protest from a distance and not participating. “It felt like getting a paper cut across your eye.” Mr. Keup  a financial adviser  has experienced internal bleeding in his right eye and his lids are swollen shut. He is so sensitive to light that he has spent almost all of his time in dark rooms at home. “As far as my day to day  I’m pretty emotional ” he said. While the police typically say they try aim for the torso  back or buttocks to avoid eye injuries  paintballs can easily veer in other directions. Teresa Nelson  legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota  said paintballs are “lethal in disguise.”  None None “What was terrifying is we didn’t know what they were firing ” said Tanya Kerssen  38  a writer and researcher. The fluorescent marks on the torsos of her friends who had been hit were caused by a plastic projectile with paint marker. One of the friends who was hit  Sam Rhode  said it felt like a sharp  stinging pain. In the two weeks since  the gash has grown into an eight-inch bruise. “If they had one guy talk to people and say  ‘Here’s why you need to go inside ’ it wouldn’t have taken them any more time ” said Mr. Rhode  44. Thor Eells  executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association  which represents nearly 40 000 law enforcement professionals  said police have used paintballs for two decades  but they are more visible now because of the need. “These are unfortunately necessary tools that have to be used now given the level of violence and destruction that has taken place ” said Mr. Eells  a former commander of the Colorado Springs Police Department. Howard Jordan  the police chief of Oakland between 2011 and 2013 during the Occupy protests  said Oakland had mixed results with using paintballs. Ideally  they help identify people who police may later want to arrest because of the marks they leave. But in reality  Mr. Jordan said  identifying protesters with paint rarely works. “People don’t usually stick around after they get shot with a paintball.” Chief Art Acevedo of the Houston Police said his department of more than 5 000 law enforcement officers uses paintballs only for training. As president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association  a network of chiefs and sheriffs in the largest cities in the United States and Canada  he plans to discuss and evaluate the use of paintballs  among other tools police have used against violent protesters  in an upcoming meeting. “We’re going to discuss the good  the bad and the ugly ” he said. “It’s important for everyone to take a step back and look at the circumstances in which we’re deploying these munitions and if there is a better way.” Mr. Keup  the man who was shot in the eye  said that growing up  he always had respect and appreciation for law enforcement officials. Now  he feels anxiety even when he passes police cars. “I don’t trust them ” he said. “I don’t feel like it’s safe to go in anywhere where there is a big police presence.” John Ismay contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/style/pickleball.html,Is Pickleball the Perfect Pandemic Pastime? Advertisement Supported by Ellen DeGeneres recently declared herself among the intergenerational sport’s ardent enthusiasts. None When social distancing mandates struck Daytona Beach  Fla.  in April  residents of Latitude Margaritaville (one of several “55 and better” communities inspired by the Jimmy Buffett song) quickly gathered the essentials. There were face masks and gloves and cans of food  yes  but also paddles. And balls. And chalk. Because while the coronavirus pandemic may have put normal life on hold  nothing was going to stop these people from playing pickleball. None To play  two teams (typically two people each) send the ball back and forth on a small court  separated by a low net. The first side to score 11 points by a margin of at least two wins. Serves must be diagonal and underhand  the ball needs to bounce on each side before a volley and players can’t hit when standing in a close-to-the-net area known as “the Kitchen” — but that’s about all the persnickety detail. Thus it has long been a staple of community center rec rooms and middle school gym classes. None And thanks to the pandemic  there may soon be many new “picklers ” as obsessives proudly call themselves. In driveways and rooftops across the country  players are setting up makeshift courts  using temporary paint or chalk to draw lines and making nets out of whatever items are available  and getting everyone in their households to join in on the fun. The talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres recently said she was having a hard time walking because she was playing so much. “As we’re going through this together and you’re trying to find things to do as a family or as a small group  it’s a perfect sport to take up ” said Tamara Baldanza Dekker  the chief marketing officer at Margaritaville  which has pickleball courts in each of its locations. To parents desperate for new ways to entertain children (or themselves)  pickleball can be a godsend. “It’s a multigenerational game  so you can play with your kids  and grandparents can play with their grandkids ” Ms. Dekker said. “It appeals to everybody.” Annie Webb  55  a transcript clerk in St. Davids  Pa.  began playing pickleball last year and has been glad to have it as an option during isolation. “Finding another activity besides long walks with the dog while our tennis courts are closed has been really fun ” she said. And while running around a court for an hour can certainly be a good workout  pickleball  with its lightweight paddles and low net  requires little skill or training (though pros compete in U.S. Open-style tournaments each year). “You really don’t have a great advantage hitting the ball harder than someone else. It’s much more of a game about placement and pace ” said Michael McLean  62  a Latitude Margaritaville resident and self-described “pickleball aficionado.” “So that kind of equalizes it for a lot of folks.” There are few rules about comportment  too. “It’s not like stuffy tennis ” Ms. Dekker said. “When you go to these tournaments  people are having a party! They’re interacting with not only each other  but the players. It’s serious  but serious fun.” Laura Gainor  37  a marketing consultant for the USA Pickleball Association (U.S.A.P.A.) who lives in Park Ridge  Ill.  took up the sport only after she got her job  but found herself “extremely addicted immediately ” she said. She passed her skills along to her friends  and “pretty soon  we had 40 people that started playing every Friday night.” Because of the shutdown  gathering at a court for a few rounds of drinks and pickleball among pals isn’t a possibility right now. “Community’s kind of the key word with pickleball ” Ms. Gainor said. “We all just want to play so bad  but you just got to be patient.” Some regular players are finding workarounds in order to keep their friendly competitions alive  however. In Margaritaville  many residents passionate about both pickleball and social distancing are wearing gloves and masks during each match  touching paddles instead of shaking hands  and keeping contact with the ball at a minimum. “Everybody is very sensitive to being smart  because we don’t want the courts to close down ” said Stuart Schultz  the director of residential community relations there (and Mr. McLean’s frequent pickleball partner). It helps that there’s already a “non-volley zone” of seven feet from the net on each side of the court  so players on opposite teams can stay comfortably apart. “It’s almost the ultimate social-distancing game ” Mr. McLean said. None The U.S.A.P.A. website offers a list of safety tips (among offerings of paddles and other official equipment for purchase). “We want to make sure that they’re staying safe  because it’s such a passionate group  and it’s so hard to not play pickleball ” she said. For most Picklers  though  playing at home with only their fellow quarantiners is more than enough right now. “When I’m in the backyard hitting with my husband or kids  I can feel like things are somewhat normal ” Ms. Webb said. “Or  at least  have hope that they will get back there soon.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/sports/coronavirus-trout-fishing.html,The Trout Were Socially Distant  but Not the Family Memories Advertisement Supported by outdoors Fishing with his adult son for the first time  the author wonders if the pandemic will be remembered as the time we were distancing and yet simultaneously being drawn closer together. None ATTLEBORO  Mass. — I distanced myself from my son Patrick  not as a precaution against the virus — though he is an emergency room nurse and in the thick of things — but because a novice fly fisherman poses enough danger. Stand too close and that whip of line he has aloft  tipped with a tiny hook masquerading as a bug  can take a wayward path and snag your shirt. Or your ear. I know this. The sun was low in the trees and the stream now slid by like ink. A trout nosed the surface beside a half-submerged log and Patrick was in range if he could just keep that line out of the brambles around him. I watched the scene play out from the road bridge while I blew cigar smoke at the midges flitting around my head. Years ago I sat along streams like this with my oldest brother  Dennis  and watched him roll cigarettes while we scanned the water for the telltale ripple of a feeding trout to target. We were younger and more irresponsible  dropping everything in spring to travel to the Catskills  or the Rockies or the White Mountains — anywhere for the chance to catch magic hours like this when hungry trout rise in waning light and a trance-like stillness closes in. Now  as I watched Patrick  I felt a twinge of melancholy. Denny  now in his 70s and a dozen years older  lives hours away and we share fewer spring adventures. It didn’t help that in this time of self-isolation and daily death toll announcements he said during one of our more frequent phone calls now that he and his wife  Devina  were getting their affairs in order. All of them. It just seemed timely and prudent  he said. “We’ve settled on cremation ” he said. Our mother once termed the early 1970s “the worst years ” so much societal unrest — and worry over Dennis  her oldest. Fresh out of college and then the Peace Corps  Denny had a wanderer’s spirit that took him from coast to coast and to Denver in between. He would light home for a time but then with little warning he’d shoulder his backpack and hike for the highway  to hitch a ride … somewhere. “Why don’t you ask Dennis to take you fishing?” she once asked  her motive clear even to a boy barely a teenager. Keep him close. None He watched closely as I tied different flies on our lines and spared me any wise remark as I expounded on the life cycle of trout bugs  from their submerged origins as crawling creatures to their transition to flying adults. “Just pay attention to what’s coming off the water ” I said. I hooked a nice trout on a submerged nymph pattern and it jumped completely out of the water to try to shake the hook. I handed my rod over to Patrick’s girlfriend  Meg  so she could feel the fish. The trout swam in close and with slack in the line  eventually slipped off. “L.D.R. ” I said. “Long distance release.” We kept at it for a while but grew frustrated as the magic hour commenced and the trout were leaving bull's-eyes all over the water but beyond our casting range. We’d decided to call it a night when a stranger walked up holding a plastic shopping bag sagging with something heavy inside. He spoke with a Russian accent  and with his few words of English we came to understand he had a big trout in the bag he wanted to give us  he didn’t know how to cook it and did not want it to go to waste. “Caught four ” he said. “Let go the others.” “Four? ” I said  impressed. “What were you using?” “Marshmallows.” “Marshmallows?” He nodded. “Mini ” he said  and pressed his thumb and forefinger together to emphasize the small variety. So much for weighted nymphs and artificial gnats. We accepted his generous offer  and Meg snapped a photograph of Patrick and I with the fish. “Well  that was different ” Patrick said  and as we laughed  I thought how I’d retell the story to Denny the next morning  sending first just the photograph as a tease and saving the best part for the question I knew would come: What fly did you use? Perhaps someday Patrick will remember that the first trout he ever held with the fly rod I bought him  came that spring of the virus when we were all social distancing and simultaneously being drawn closer together. Thomas Mooney is a journalist in Attleboro  Mass.  and a lifetime practitioner of social distancing each spring with the advent of trout season. Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/opinion/covid-fishing.html,My Isolation Breaking Point Advertisement Supported by I can’t wait for social distancing to end  so I can be alone again. None Mr. Labash is the author of “Fly Fishing With Darth Vader.” In this endless war against Covid-19  I have tried to be a dutiful soldier. I’ve mostly stayed home to binge-watch and binge-eat (bad news and Fig Newtons  respectively). I’ve yet to poleax any octogenarians as they dive-tackle the last pack of Cottonelle. I only sneeze on immediate family. I’m a regular Audie Murphy. But even we stoical war-hero types have our breaking point  and I’ve reached mine. My governor  Larry Hogan  banned recreational fishing in his recent stay-at-home order  intended to halt the spread of the coronavirus. As a proud citizen (now  inmate) of Maryland  once un-ironically nicknamed the “Free State ” I’ve always liked Mr. Hogan. He’s stout and feisty  more workhorse than show pony. He hates many of the same things I do  like high taxes and Pennsylvania (whose tributaries pollute our Chesapeake Bay). He’s that filthiest of words in the modern Republican Party — a centrist. I’ve voted for him twice. But now I’m rethinking my drink. In early days  when Mr. Hogan started closing schools and “nonessential” businesses  we avid fly fishermen thought our biggest problem would be our parks and rivers getting overrun by newbies  many of whom hadn’t seen sunlight in years. Stir-Crazy Nation now had nowhere else to go (including to jobs  now being eliminated at alarming speed). A clueless dad  out for a walk with the family  skipped rocks across my fishing buddy’s favorite brown-trout hole as he was trying to fish it  unaware of river etiquette. At one of my go-to bass spots  I witnessed a roving band of bored teenagers throwing rocks at geese across the pond. They came nowhere near hitting them — the noodle-armed delinquents probably hadn’t lifted anything heavier than a PlayStation controller since seventh grade. Still  I couldn’t wait for all this “social distancing” to end  so I could be alone again. None None The coronavirus  apparently  isn’t the only epidemiological disaster. As Yossarian said in “Catch-22 ” “Insanity is contagious.” Never mind that most fly fishers  nearly all catch-and-releasers  need at least 50 feet of space to ply their craft  7.3 times beyond social-distancing guidelines  unless they want to bury a zug bug in someone’s cornea on the backcast. Never mind that the Environmental Protection Agency has relaxed enforcement standards during the crisis  so that it is now more lawful in Maryland for a petroleum company to dump pollutants in a river than it is for me to stand in one and catch a fish without killing it. What made me snap was when the Department of Natural Resources stipulated that charter boats could still go out  as long as they were fishing for food and kept it to fewer than 10 people. I frequently see these crowded boats zip by me while striper-fishing the jetties of the Chesapeake. And while I don’t begrudge a skipper making a living  just picturing their pink-faced sports floating by on a party barge  listening to bad bro-country while downing Fireball shots  as the boat catches their fish while trolling … well  that was just too much. So  I did what I always do when the world stops making sense — went fishing. I grabbed my trusty six-weight and my sentimental-favorite vest  which now has more holes than pockets  though I can’t seem to throw it away. I went to a nearby farm pond  half-scummed over with algae  but which is so tucked away  I drove by it for 15 years without knowing it was there. I brought a makeshift creel (a knapsack lined with a Safeway bag)  in case I had to fake a fish homicide if a natural resources officer rolled up on me. As the sun slipped behind the tree line  while spring peepers tuned up the band  I caught a mess of largemouth and crappie and bluegill  each of them somehow managing to wriggle out of my hand before they made it to the creel. Yet they didn’t have me feeling like an outlaw  they made me feel what they always do: gratitude. Helping me live just a little lighter. As Jim Harrison wrote: “Fishing does what poet Tom Crawford said about bird watching: It removes the weight of what we’re not.” While too many of our fellow citizens have perished  while two of my cousins and one of my nephews are in quarantine  while the woman at Safeway courageously bagging my groceries told me she was staying healthy  “but some girl at Giant just died” (she offered this matter-of-factly  a-grocer-turned-grizzled-infantryman)  it was good to see old friends. They might just be fish. But they’ll do. Especially with the rest of our friends locked away. None None None Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/17/sports/olympics/tokyo-olympics-in-july.html,"Can the Olympics Take Place in July? (This July?) Advertisement None 
	The coronavirus pandemic is bringing most of the world’s sports to a standstill. But one event that is still scheduled is the Tokyo Olympics  which are set to begin in late July.
 
	On Tuesday  shortly after Europe’s soccer federation postponed this summer’s European championships  Thomas Bach  the International Olympic Committee president  reiterated his organization’s commitment to holding the Games this summer in Japan.
 
	Bach acknowledged an “unprecedented situation ” adding  “We are in solidarity with the whole of society to do everything to contain the virus.”
 
	Bach said a working group focused on the challenges of the virus  would continue to adhere to the two main principles:
 
	1. To protect the health of everyone involved and to support the containment of the virus.
 
	2. To safeguard the interests of the athletes and of Olympic sport.
 
	That is going to be incredibly difficult.
 
	The torch lighting in Greece went off as planned last week  while parts of Western Europe were shutting down. But Greece stopped the ensuing torch relay a day later because large crowds were gathering to watch. In any other year  the relay would be a cause for celebration. In the year of coronavirus  large crowds have come to be seen as giant petri dishes for Covid-19  the disease caused by the virus.
 
	The Tokyo Olympic Organizing Committee has been reluctant to even consider  at least publicly  the possibility of postponing the Games. When one member of the organizing committee’s executive board was recently quoted as saying a delay of a year or two was under consideration  the chairman of the committee  Yoshiro Mori  quickly held a news conference to reiterate that the Games remained on track to open on time.
 
	Japan’s Olympic minister  Seiko Hashimoto  said it was “impossible” that the Games would be delayed. Then on Monday  Shinzo Abe  Japan’s prime minister  said he had secured support from the leaders of the G-7 to hold the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics ""in their complete form.""
 
	He did not give further details.
 
	On Tuesday  Japanese media reported that a vice president of Japan’s Olympic committee tested positive for the virus.
 
	The Olympics are a huge undertaking  many years and many billions of dollars in the making. Those economic considerations must be balanced with the health and safety of athletes and spectators  which officials insist they are doing.
 
	“The money will have the least to do with the decision ” said Terrence Burns  a longtime consultant for Olympic host cities. “This choice is purely going to be made around athletes and public health and safety. They have no other choice.”
 
	Still  no matter how great the stated desire to push ahead  it is becoming more difficult by the day.
 
	“I think we can assume a reduction in transmission rates linked to warmer temperatures as the summer approaches ” said Gerardo Chowell  a professor of mathematical epidemiology and chair of the Department of Population Health Sciences at Georgia State University.
 
	But Professor Chowell warns that “it is unlikely that warmer weather alone will sufficiently control the epidemic in temperate areas without additional social-distancing interventions.’’
 
	Also  would a reduction in transmission rates be enough? The 15 countries with the most coronavirus cases sent about 4 000 athletes  — out of a total of 11 000 — to the Rio Games in 2016.
 Country Cases Deaths Athletes in Rio Mainland China
 80 881 3 226 392 Italy
 27 980 2 158 309 Iran
 16 169 988 63 Spain 11 178 491 307 South Korea
 8 320 81 207 France 6 633 148 392 Germany 6 012 13 418 United States 5 002 93 555 Switzerland 1 563 13 102 United Kingdom 1 543 55 360 Japan 1 534 34 335 Norway 1 443 3 62 Netherlands 1 413 24 237 Austria 1 332 3 71 Belgium 1 243 10 104 
	“At the same time ” Professor Chowell said  “the virus will likely start to spread in the Southern Hemisphere as temperatures there start to drop.”
 
	Indeed  there have already been cases in Brazil  Argentina  South Africa and Australia  where summer is drawing to a close.
 
	In the United States  Professor Chowell thinks the peak of the virus might occur earlier than midsummer if social distancing is maintained at sufficiently high levels.
 
	“I think the goal is to get to the vaccine in 12 months ” he said.
 
	Even if the virus  is under control in places like the United States  Italy and Spain by summer  teams from the Southern Hemisphere may be in the throes of the pandemic as the colder weather settles in. Either the coronavirus has barely affected Africa or the continent is far behind the rest of the world in terms of testing.
 
	Chile is already seeing an increasing number of cases — 150 as of Monday — and the government has ordered schools closed.
 
	Teams from those Southern Hemisphere countries make up a large and important segment of Olympic athletes. East Africans dominate distance running. Australia  which had the third largest Olympic team in Rio  420 athletes  is a force in swimming.
 Cate Campbell is a five-time Olympic medalist for Australia. Neymar scored Brazil’s decisive goal for the gold medal in Rio. Eliza McCartney won bronze in the pole vault in 2016. SOLD TO FOREIGNERS SOLD TO THE JAPANESE 2.3 million tickets 5.5 million tickets TICKETS SOLD  TO FOREIGNERS TICKETS SOLD  TO THE JAPANESE 2.3 million 5.5 million 
	Nearly eight million tickets were made available for the 2020 Games  with about a third going to people outside Japan. The I.O.C. allocates tickets for each country based on population  the size of the Olympic team and proximity to the host city. But people from the United States and the countries of Western Europe are always among the most visible attendees. Add to that more than 11 000 athletes from more than 200 nations and nearly that many people from the international news media.
 
	By closing down schools and enforcing quarantines  Japan has begun to get some control over the coronavirus. Can thousands of athletes and millions of fans descend on Tokyo without triggering a new outbreak?
 
	“I think the first goal is to control the epidemic in Japan ” Professor Chowell said. “If the virus is raging in Japan in six weeks  visitors will not want to visit Japan.”
 
	Athletes everywhere are losing precious time for training.
 
	With Italy and Spain under strict lockdowns  it has become nearly impossible for athletes there to train.
 
	The American fencer Race Imboden and the French fencer Ysaora Thibus arrived in Los Angeles  early this month for a Grand Prix fencing event. The couple  who are based in Rome  soon learned the event had been canceled. Both their fencing gym and their training gym were closed shortly thereafter.
 
	""This morning  I realized that I can't go back home  I can’t train  and I don't know if the Olympics are going to be on the same dates "" Thibus said on Monday. “I don't know how to train for this.""
 
	""It's a mess "" Imboden added. “We don't know what to do anymore. It feels like it's all being taken away.""
 
	In the United States  organized training for nearly everyone who isn’t a runner essentially ceased Monday when President Trump discouraged all gatherings of more than 10 people.
 ‘All of us are kind of thrown off.’ ‘I don't know how to train for this.’ He can’t find a gym to train. Quote from Jess Graba  coach for Sunisa Lee. The French fencer Ysaora Thibus.

	Colleges have closed  including Stanford and Texas  two major training spots for Olympic-caliber swimmers  many of whom are hunting for pools. U.S.A. Swimming has canceled all its meets through at least April 30.
 
	The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee has been flooded with calls from athletes  coaches and athletic officials trying to gain access to its training center in Colorado Springs. The committee has had to turn them down  since everyone at the training center is free of symptoms related to the virus and welcoming an outsider could jeopardize the current crowd.
 
	An elite gymnast  Colin Van Wicklen  had continued training at the University of Oklahoma after graduating in 2017. He went back home to Houston yesterday after the school closed all of its facilities  but he can't find a gym that has the proper equipment for him to train on. For example  he needs a high bar that is strong enough to support his weight  but the one at the gym near him isn’t sturdy enough.
 
	“They’re all trying to find alternative training ” said Jess Graba  who coaches Sunisa Lee  a favorite to make the U.S. Olympic women’s gymnastics team. “All of us are kind of thrown off.”
 
	The list of altered qualifying competitions for the Olympics is lengthy and likely to grow. Every sport has had to cancel some events. In a normal year  those would have been opportunities for athletes to fine-tune their skills or  in some cases  gain qualifying points to make them eligible for their country’s Olympic teams.
 
	Bach  the I.O.C. president  has advised national Olympic committees and international sports federations to come up with new ways of selecting Olympians.
 
	He noted Tuesday that just 57 percent of the athletes are already qualified for the Games  meaning nearly half the places still need to be filled. “The IOC will work with the international federations to make any necessary and practical adaptations to their respective qualification systems for Tokyo 2020 ” Bach said  suggesting that selections will be made based on existing rankings.
 
	But even that might not be enough to attract the best of the best.
 
	The N.B.A. is considering extending its season through the summer  which could prevent players from competing in Tokyo. Golf and tennis will have tournaments to reschedule  which could conflict with Olympic competitions — while giving athletes an opportunity to make up for lost income.
 
	With each day  it’s increasingly likely that certain elite athletes and countries might not be able to participate  making the Tokyo Games like no other  and not for reasons the organizers would like.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/sports/cresta-run-olympic-skeleton-women.html,It’s Among the World’s Hardest Sled Runs. Why Weren’t Women Allowed to Use it? Advertisement Supported by The Cresta Run in Switzerland is notoriously difficult and dangerous for practitioners of skeleton  the Olympic sledding sport. Until recently  women were barred from using it. None None Until recently  she would have been watching this  “the craziest thing in the world ” as she calls it  from the sideline. The “Ladies Not Admitted” sign on a locker room made that clear. The Cresta Run  a three-quarter-mile track and the birthplace of the sport practiced on it  skeleton  the Olympic sport akin to sledding  had kept women off its ice for decades. Kuhn belongs to the members-only club that controls the ice chute and which agreed in 2018 to allow women to participate during a two-year trial. None Simon Ford is one such member. He feels strongly about opening the run to women. “There is no excuse for a sports club in 2020 to not have equal opportunities ” Ford said. He said it was “more fun” being able to share the ice chute with his four daughters but acknowledged that it was a delicate topic among other members. “Let’s take things slowly ” he said. None The Cresta stands out from other ice runs for its corners. It is notorious for the particularly low and open corner  known as the shuttlecock  in which riders reaching speeds of more than 80 miles per hour can easily be flung from the chute and onto a bed of hay. Trips to the emergency room are common  and there have been multiple deaths over the decades. The St. Moritz club  which has about 1 250 members  a fifth of which are women  is an eclectic and eccentric place where the Union Jack is flown  the club’s history is preserved and traditions that have been going strong for generations continue to thrive. At the close of the season  for example  a member rides down the chute with a smoke bomb (one year  he fell and caught fire). For Rolf Sachs  the club’s honorary vice president  the Cresta’s spirit is what makes it unique. As he sees it  it’s a combination of eccentricity  genteel sportsmanship and competitiveness — but not at all costs — with a dash of humor and wit. This is the spirit that members value and that some feared would disappear if the club gave women equality on the run. Sachs disagrees. “It will not change the camaraderie ” said Sachs  who sponsors a night race in which the Cresta is lit by 300 torches. “Instead it will help the club become more spirited as we are just adding extra people who like it.” Yet some members  including Hans-Jürg Buff  are not pleased with this trial. Buff alluded to the fact that for most of the Cresta’s history it was a gentlemen’s club  and said he believes that by allowing women on the run it is losing its unique selling point. “I do not hate women ” he said  “but men by nature want to be heroes. If women are able to ride the Cresta too  it takes the mystery of it away.” Women had competed on the Cresta until 1929  at which point they were barred and made nonactive members. It was reasoned that the chest-down positioning needed for skeleton could cause breast cancer  but rumor has it that a woman earning faster times on the chute than her husband was the real reason for it. In 2018  at the club’s general meeting  members voted to allow women back on the run as part of a two-year trial. In the preceding years  women had been granted a maximum of three slides only on Ladies Day  the last Saturday of the season. (The vote passed with a two-thirds majority.) A request for the club to consider allowing women was made by the United Kingdom Armed Forces Winter Sports Association  the association said. Members of the military had been visiting the Cresta Run since the 1950s  but only the men had been allowed to ride it. Under the new conditions  women are allowed to ride the Cresta on considerably more days — although far from all — and to compete in races upon invitation. Women retain their status as nonactive members  however  meaning their right to use the Cresta is not officially recognized. Last month  on Ladies Day  Kuhn  who has been a member of the club for nearly 20 years  was one of four women competing in the Lorna Robertson Challenge Cup  which was first held in 2019. This season  she was able to get 45 runs in  which before the ruling would have taken her at least 15 years to achieve. It appears that Kuhn and other female riders are here to stay. The trial period for women was recently extended for another year. Beyond that  the club’s president  James Sunley  said  the committee would “take the temperature of all the members and see what they want.” Sunley  who has led the club since 2014  said  “People are always scared of change ” and referred to the tendency to look at the past with rose-tinted glasses. “We can’t pretend we are in the 1920s ” he said. “We are in the 2020s.” For now  Kuhn does not seem too bothered by her nonactive membership status or by that “Ladies Not Admitted” sign on the locker room door. “I’m just happy to be riding ” she said  smiling while packing up her knickerbockers and socks. She was in the locker room. Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/travel/ice-fishing-new-hampshire.html,Ice Fishing Is Fun! Advertisement Supported by No  really. A trip with a New Hampshire guide reveals how much the sport has evolved  while keeping the eternal battle of angler and fish at its heart. None None It’s to sit on a frozen lake. Any mention of ice fishing usually comes with a built-in beat of silence  requiring either no explanation at all or eliciting puzzled  are-you-joking comments. Growing up  ice fishing was the angling of last resort. We’d set our tip-ups — wooden devices that sat in the hole and popped a flag up if a fish took your bait. Then we’d play hockey. There aren’t many sports so boring that you have to start playing other sports in the middle of them. Our games were rarely interrupted by flags. But advances in fishing technology  better understanding of fish behavior and even social media have changed the sport from a caricature of inactivity — a metaphor for blind  ineffectual waiting in subpar conditions — into an action-packed  fish-producing winter pastime. There’s way more moving around now  meaning some. And exciting gadgets threaten the sport’s fundamental sad conceit by actually telling you if anything’s down there. So instead of the movie “Grumpy Old Men ” I tell people to imagine zipping across a frozen lake on a snowmobile  an ice shack so warm you may take your coat off  and a real-life video game on a sonar screen where winning leads to celebrations at whatever pokes through the hole. Imagine fishy photos — true Instagram bait — and maybe dinner to take home. Add warm snacks  jokes  stories and fortifying beverages  and suddenly ice fishing doesn’t sound so bad. None We picked destinations to inspire you  delight you and motivate you to explore the world. So Mike and I are at Silver Lake  in Madison  for the same reasons people listen to the podcast: community within an often lonely sport  a few laughs  and to steal as many fishing tips as possible. I suspect what prevents people from trying ice fishing  besides its reputation for being unpleasant  boring and dangerous  is not realizing that guides exist. A guided trip — like a nature tour mixed with a deep-sea fishing charter  minus the seasickness — helps anglers safely visit spots and does away with the guesswork and hassle of gear and bait. At 164 feet  Silver Lake is one of New Hampshire’s deepest bodies of water  and has no reported invasive aquatic plant species. Once we arrive at the lake’s public boat launch  Mr. Groves scoots up the snow-covered boat ramp on his snowmobile  says hello  and ferries us one-by-one to the fishing spot. We zoom over foot-thick ice covered in packed  crusty snow. The cloudless sky is Windex blue. I’m glad I remembered my sunscreen  sunglasses and face mask. Mount Chocorua crowds us from the north. Mr. Groves points out spots on shore — where E. E. Cumming’s treehouse was  where Grover Cleveland partied. A solitary blip becomes our destination  a hut fashioned from a pop-up camping trailer  converted with plywood sides and solar panels. As I hop off the sled  the insulating snow gobbles all sound. The light out here  amplified by the grand plaza of ice  is extreme: somewhere between white sand beach and operating room. As Mr. Groves goes to pick up Mike and the snowmobile fades  I realize something miraculous: there’s no wind today. Ice fishing is always fun  sometimes because of enthusiastic weather. But on days like this  when besides the occasional distant whine of a gas auger or the ice pinging as it thickens — a sound like whales playing laser tag beneath you — when you’re a half mile from anything that even could make a noise  the silence feels almost holy  cloistered as one is on the pop-up remoteness of a newly frozen lake. For three months New Hampshire essentially gains more than 250 square miles — roughly a quarter the size of Rhode Island — of flat  undeveloped  public space. Seat cushions and propane heater welcome us inside  as does a bearded man in unironic Carhartt: Vinnie Matturro  another Fish Nerds guide. Solar-powered Christmas lights hang on “simulated hard wood” walls. There’s an iPhone charger and the floor has holes in it. Ice fishing gear usually looks ridiculous or cool or both: The rods are two feet long. The augers are lawn mower engines or cordless power drills attached to 3-foot corkscrewed blades. (“The hardest part of ice fishing used to be making a hole in the ice ” Mr. Groves says.) Stubby computers in zippered lunch coolers help find fish. And outside  Mr. Groves sets those rustic Rube Goldberg devices  tip-ups. But our focus will be jigging from the warmth of the shack  targeting larger  generally tougher-to-catch lake trout. We load neon jigs with dead smelt  plop them through black holes and check our fish-finders with the head-sideways  looking-one-place-but-moving-something-important-with-your-hand-somewhere-else self-seriousness of arthroscopic surgeons. It’s so cool. Within minutes  I mark a fish. But honestly when the image translates to machine-gun tugging on my rod it feels the way all bites do: like nothing short of divine intervention. I set the hook. My rod bows and jerks like a horse tossing its head. I don’t suspect a monster  but the vibe among spectators is cautiously thrilled. Through the hole comes a sleek  foot-long lake trout  flapping angrily in this strange resistance-less vacuum and hearing the unfamiliar vibrations of human cheering. It’s stunning. A dark back glistening as if shellacked  Dijon speckles. Critical  predatory eyes question our whole enterprise and inquire after our intentions. A toothy jaw mouths piscine curses or prayers. Mr. Groves produces a gag tape measure that says the fish is 25 inches. We snap a photo. This slow-growing  native apex predator well below the legal 18- inch minimum can reach 3 feet. I tend to release all lakers. The real battle in catch-and-release fishing is sometimes between the desire to get the fish back in the water and the urge to keep marveling at its beauty. This basically being outer space for it  I think of how long I’d enjoy a moonwalk without a spacesuit and cradle the fish back through the hole. Anglers are getting better at handling fish  but catch-and-release fishing is still recreational abduction: validation-seeking  insecure people like myself bothering fish just to confirm primal skills long rendered unnecessary. Fishing encourages a full-bodied communion with the water  though. So spending free time being humbled and outsmarted by creatures we supposedly evolved past can instill a sense of connection  modesty and reverence. That’s another reason I enjoy Mr. Groves’ podcast. He feels like a voice of reason  reminding anglers that prized and much-coddled bass have only even been in New Hampshire since the 1800s  and that yucky fish like lampreys are native and ecologically important. He rails against New Hampshire’s biggest ice-fishing derby not offering a catch-and-release option  while happily frying up invasive species. Fishing both allows for and often demands this bespoke morality  called upon as frequently as pliers and variable even among anglers on the same trip. So Mr. Groves  who learned the biological history of every species he goes after — when they came to the state  who stocked them — has enough information to serve as something like a moral guide as well. The rest of our morning will prove just how lucky my catch was. Mike gets two bites  but can’t set the hook. Mr. Groves switches between patiently teaching and playful teasing  asking distracting questions about working with dinosaurs. “So when you’re digging for these things  and you find a bone  is that like fishing?” “Oh it’s very similar ” Mike says  “You don’t just dig randomly  you prospect.” They discuss the nearby Ossippee Ring Dike  a geological formation created by an ancient volcano  and how there’s never been a dinosaur found in the state. “So there’s an opportunity to be the first one ” Mr. Groves says. “Yeah let me focus on setting a hook first ” Mike says. Mr. Groves’ approach to fishing is somewhere between a Zen koan and “Catch-22.” “I believe fishing should be fun  so it’s not about the fish  it’s about having a great time. But I don’t like fishing — I like catching fish. That’s the fun part. Clients are always having a great time. I’m not having fun till I catch a fish. So the whole approach is: how much fun can we have while we’re doing this.” The holes stop producing bites. Time to move. We check “cusk traps.” Cusk are also called burbot  eelpout or “poor man’s lobster” for their flaky  sweet fillets somewhere between cod and catfish. Some lakes allow anglers to set six simple “cusk lines” for 24 hours unattended. The joy of sitting around a wood stove with beer and chili knowing that at that moment you’re technically fishing is one of my favorite parts of fishing in the state. And pulling up each line is like starting the day with six scratch tickets. Mr. Groves drills a hole beside the first frozen-over trap. “Wait  what are you doing?” I ask. He takes a coat hanger fashioned into a long hook and reaches into the new hole  pulling the line through. “Then you just cut the line  pull it through and retie it ” Mr. Groves says  “Cusk don’t care if the line is pretty.” Mike and I groan  thinking back on all the time and energy we’ve wasted chipping out iced-over cusk lines with crowbars. The lines are empty  but we just got something amazing to take home with us. We move again for one final attempt  switching species to target rainbow trout. Our time has been part fishing lesson  part natural history tour  part entertainment. But we’d still like some fillets to take home. Mr. Groves directs us to a spot in a foot-and-a-half of water. We jig  with a baited tip-up 15 feet away. It seems like an insane place to fish  another of his pranks. He urges us to watch the holes. Sure enough  a shadow flutters past  gone like a horror movie monster before my eyes can focus. Minutes later my tip-up flag shoots up. I race over  sliding to the hole on my knees like a snow-suited Springsteen. Up comes a 15 inch rainbow trout. Fat  iridescently pink and absurdly pretty. A stocked species Mr. Groves is happy to remind us is originally from California  it will be coming home with us. We jig for another 20 minutes  and then turn toward the chilly gloom of our waiting car. Ice fishing leaves an experience afterglow  a pleasant  tingly emotional windburn. There’s a high  from the logistical boldness it requires  the smallness it engenders. A mystical appreciation. You’ve just done a wild  silly thing  there’s adrenaline and calm  and now your day could never be the same. This is the very real harvest us weirdos who love ice fishing seek to leave with as much as photos or dinner: this little doggy bag of blessedness. Because a day on the hardwater replicates being alive like nothing else: it’s sometimes successful  sometimes unpleasant  always beautiful. Often you find yourself standing there  implausibly upright in a gorgeous  uncaring place  taking it for granted. Yelling out petty triumphs or failures. Or enjoying the peace. Then  just when you’re figuring things out  it’s time to go. Stepping off the ice always feels like just having lived a whole  strange little life. And who wouldn’t want to try that  at least once.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-morehouse-football.html,Morehouse Cancels Football and Cross Country Because of Coronavirus Advertisement Supported by The historically black college in Atlanta is one of the first universities to cancel football in 2020 amid the pandemic. None None None But Morehouse said it had concluded that it could not safely play. “Responsible leaders have to see us as being in a crisis  and a characteristic of a crisis is unpredictability ” David A. Thomas  the college president  said in a phone interview. “Good management says any uncertainty you can take out of the equation you should take out. One element where we could create certainty is what are we going to do with athletics.” Morehouse is a member of the N.C.A.A.’s Division II. It was scheduled to begin its football season on Sept. 5  with a game against Edward Waters College  an H.B.C.U. in Jacksonville  Fla.  Thomas said that Morehouse  which is in Atlanta  would honor its athletic scholarships  and that playing games without fans had not been a viable solution because the absence of spectators did not shield players from risk of infection. None “To make that decision would be the equivalent of canceling Michigan-Ohio State  Harvard-Yale  go down the line ” Thomas said.  In an interview on Friday morning  minutes after Morehouse’s announcement  Mark Emmert  the president of the N.C.A.A.  said he expected more schools to upend their seasons or entire athletic programs for health or financial reasons. Colleges and universities across the country have already cut dozens of teams. “I’m afraid and confident in my fear that we’ll see more sports be dropped  whether it’s programs or entire seasons canceled ” Emmert said. “And that’s really sad because we’re talking about opportunities that these student-athletes love to participate in  and it’s really  really important to their life and their growth and development.” Although the N.C.A.A. canceled championship events for spring and summer sports  including the Division I men’s and women’s basketball tournaments  individual conferences and schools are in charge of their regular seasons. (The N.C.A.A. oversees the football championship in Division II  but it has no authority over the College Football Playoff  which has involved Football Bowl Subdivision teams like Alabama  Clemson and Ohio State.) None Government orders for quarantines of travelers could also be important factors for the football season  which is scheduled to begin in earnest around the first weekend in September. “Playing football safely is an enormously challenging thing ” Emmert said. “And it’s going to look different across the country.” At least four games that were previously canceled at the Football Championship Subdivision level involved H.B.C.U.s. And no schools in two leading H.B.C.U. conferences — the Southwestern Athletic Conference and the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference — have called their football players back to campus to begin voluntary workouts  something many Division I schools have already done. Players in those conferences are not expected to arrive until after July 4 weekend. If the decision-making on football within black colleges has veered toward cautious  one factor could be fewer financial pressures to play compared to  say  Alabama or Georgia. Television deals are nowhere near as lucrative  and most H.B.C.U. teams rely heavily on funding from their institutions. If there is no football  home teams would save money by not having to pay visiting teams  and there would be significant costs savings — particularly for travel.  And if there is football  testing for the virus — which would cost between $100-$140 per test for MEAC schools — would easily reach six figures  according to Dennis Thomas  the commissioner of the conference  which has member schools running from Delaware down to Florida.  “It gets expensive ” said Thomas  whose schools can have close to 90 players on their football teams. “People are going to have to make decisions. Obviously  the A-5” — the so-called Autonomy Five conferences  which includes the Big Ten and the Southeastern Conference — “is more financially able to do that than others.” Charles McClelland  the commissioner of the Southwestern Athletic Conference  whose 10 black colleges range from Texas to Alabama  expected to have a better idea in several weeks of what a college football season might look like. But at the moment  all of his schools are in states where the infection rates are surging upward. “We’re preparing to start but very cautiously ” he said. “We have plans to start  start late  start and then stop and then start again  and not play at all. We’ll react whatever direction Covid goes and adjust.” And Greg Sankey  the commissioner of the SEC  said leagues and schools were monitoring the decisions of others.  “We’re all connected ” said Sankey  whose league includes Georgia  about a 90-minute drive from Morehouse’s campus in Atlanta. “We’ll certainly be paying attention to what goes on around us.” Alan Blinder reported from Atlanta  and Billy Witz from New York.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/sports/ncaafootball/college-football-coronavirus-cases.html,This College Football Team Had No Coronavirus Cases at First. Then It Shut Down. Advertisement Supported by A spike in positive coronavirus tests is prompting universities across college sports to acknowledge how precarious their plans are for a season. None None The first wave of athletes spent a week in quarantine before voluntary workouts  as all players were required to do  and the scorecard was pristine: 90 tests  zero positives. Another six players straggled in a day or two later and were swabbed. Again  no positives. Then  by June 12  the final group of 24 arrivals — largely freshmen — was tested. But just a week later  Kansas State shut down its workouts until at least mid-July after two positive cases in that final group morphed into four and then eight before leaping to 14  as nearly half the team needed to be checked again. With its announcement on Saturday  Kansas State became the first school from a Power 5 conference to shut down football activities. Two other Football Bowl Subdivision schools did the same after outbreaks among their athletes  with Houston making the decision on June 12 and Boise State on Monday. None None None “I think everyone realizes the plan is written in pencil ” said Heather Lyke  the athletic director at Pittsburgh and a member of the N.C.A.A. Division I Council  which last week approved guidelines for how teams can practice leading into the season. She added: “It’s frankly hard to predict where things are going to go. The point where the council approved the calendar  things were in a reasonable state.” If the future is murky  so  too  is the breadth of recent cases. There have been confirmed positive tests at 23 of the 130 F.B.S. schools  but some public schools — including Ohio State  Alabama  Georgia and South Carolina — have refused to release testing data of their athletes  claiming that federal laws prohibiting the release of students’ personal information allow them to not release aggregated data. And given the cost of testing — close to $100 each at Kansas State  which will have about 120 players plus coaches and staff to test — schools with tighter budgets will surely consider fewer tests. At U.C.L.A.  30 players — including the team’s starting quarterback — demanded in a letter that a third-party health official be present when they participate in football-related activities because they did not trust school officials to act in their best interest with the virus. “It shows this blatant disregard for what’s going on in the nation and around the world with this pandemic ” said Billy Hawkins  a University of Houston professor who has written on the black athletic experience. He lauded the U.C.L.A. players and said workouts around the country should not take place until there is a vaccine or schools can assure players  who are not paid salaries  that they will not get sick. “If they continue in this voluntary phase  if they continue along this path  obviously more cases are going to emerge in this population ” Hawkins added. “What scares me the most is when I hear people say  ‘Oh  they’re young. It’s easier to recover.’ I don’t know if that’s a guarantee.” The decision by Kansas State to halt workouts was straightforward. Gene Taylor  Kansas State’s athletic director  said it was becoming too difficult to regulate close contact among the players  and that there was concern that a recent surge in cases could overwhelm the local health care system in Manhattan  Kan.  a college town two hours west of Kansas City with about 55 000 residents and a main hospital with only about 12 intensive care beds available. “We may not have the capacity if this thing takes off and there were hospitalizations ” Taylor said. “We want to monitor the ones in quarantine  make sure we don’t have more positives. We’ll take a pause  then retest again when we get back.” Taylor said what contributed to the outbreak was the three-day gap between the testing on June 12  a Friday  and getting the results on June 15  a Monday. The initial two players who tested positive had spent the weekend with groups of teammates — one at an apartment playing video games with anywhere from eight to 15 players  and one who went with a group to nearby Tuttle Creek Lake  a popular recreation spot. When players reported on June 15  the day workouts began  there were two more players who had fevers  a symptom of Covid-19  the disease caused by the virus. As those who were in close contact with infected players were tested again  more positives cropped up — which led to more testing. In all  close to 55 players were retested  Taylor said. “It rolled through the week like that and by Friday we got together and said  ‘We’ve got to make a decision ’” Taylor said. The players congregating without masks or social distancing made innocent mistakes  Taylor said. But in a Zoom meeting last week with Coach Chris Klieman  the players and their parents  Taylor told players they could lose their scholarships if they did not follow protocols — just the way they would if they regularly broke team rules. In an interview  Taylor said that would not happen and  he added  Klieman reiterated as much to the players and a few anxious parents the next day. But Taylor said he wanted to get the players’ attention. “I  at the end of the conversation  was just asking them please  please  please  please be careful ” Taylor said. “You have to understand how serious this can be and how it can get through the entire team. I was almost begging them. Sometimes players need to hear a little stronger language than others. There were just a few that needed to have a wake-up call. I think that wake-up call is very real now.” None “At that point  we were staying home more  only going out for essentials  so our movement was low ” Julie Gibbs  the Riley County health director  said of the change in an email. “With businesses opening up  we expected to see more movement  but I did not expect to see our grade drop quite that much. We need to get back to where we were before.” The bump in infections among college-age adults  she added  is because too many are going to clubs and bars  and not wearing masks or keeping the prescribed six feet away from others. The outbreak at L.S.U. came in large part from players going to a popular bar when they arrived back in Baton Rouge  La.  according to Sports Illustrated. None The waivers have caught the attention of lawmakers. On Wednesday  Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Cory Booker of New Jersey urged Mark Emmert  the president of the N.C.A.A.  to prohibit such waivers  calling them “legally dubious” and “morally repugnant.” Zachary Binney  an epidemiologist at Emory University  said if players were getting sick after returning to school — for the sole purpose of training for football  not going to class — it was almost immaterial whether they became infected while lifting weights or at a local watering hole. “They got exposed because you — the athletic department — brought them back to campus ” Binney said. “They were only at the bar because you told them to come back. Getting sick is a perfectly foreseeable consequence of calling students back to campus.” Taylor  the Kansas State athletic director  said it was “a fair question” to ask why schools have their athletes back on campus now  preparing for a season whose shape and scope will surely be altered by the pandemic. But he said the summer workouts  which are deemed voluntary  help prevent some injuries once practice begins and allow players to make progress toward their degrees by picking up summer school credits. For now  Kansas State football players have been asked to shelter in place for two weeks before they are retested. The only ones who are required to stay are the 14 who have tested positive  Taylor said. Many of the infected were already living together in houses or apartments  so they can stay put. Several who live with players who did not test positive have moved into dorms by themselves. Taylor said that workers in protective gear are delivering two meals per day  along with groceries  to the infected players. The outbreak prompted Kansas State to also push back the date for opening workouts for its other fall teams  cross-country and women’s volleyball  which had already returned to campus to quarantine for one week before they were scheduled to be tested on Wednesday. They will instead be tested on July 1 and begin practicing no earlier than July 5. Football players  once they test negative between July 6 and 9  could resume workouts as early as July 13. At the moment  that seems far away. The season-opening game  scheduled for Sept. 5 against visiting Buffalo  is a distant speck on the horizon in the Little Apple. There  and on many other campuses  excitement for the looming season has been diminished by uncertainty — and so many questions. “There’s been several people talking about the bumpy road ” Taylor said. “There’s going to be schools that aren’t going to be able to play. And I think we have to have other things in place. My question now is  the test we do is expensive and invasive — can we test more often?” He continued: “I am optimistic that we’ll play football. I’m not optimistic that we’ll play 12 games.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-college-football-hbcus-clemson.html,Should We Play? Two College Football Teams Have Very Different Answers Advertisement Supported by Morehouse  the first scholarship football program to cancel its season  cited the coronavirus’s disproportionate impact on Black people. Clemson has insisted on continuing despite 37 positive tests. None None Instead  Thomas homed in on a single calculation: Could he guarantee the players would be safe? None Now  with the start of the college football season two months away  Division II Morehouse’s decision — the first scholarship program to shut down football — raises another question across the college sports landscape: will Morehouse  an all-male  historically Black college in Atlanta  be an outlier or the first pebble to ripple across the pond? “What I think responsible leadership will do in higher education is ask the question: Why are we in business?” Thomas said in an interview. “We are not in business to provide sports  at least we’re not at Morehouse. We’re in business to provide a high-quality education that allows men to prepare themselves for a lifetime of leadership and service and vocational excellence.” He added: “I would hope every president asks themselves that question: Why am I in business? What am I here for? Now I’ve got a set of decisions to make  and am I making those decisions consistent with what my institutional purpose is?” None With tens of millions in revenue from a football season at stake  Clemson has continued to plow ahead with its voluntary workout program even as the school announced Friday that 14 more players had tested positive for the virus  running the number of positive tests to 37 — nearly one-third of the roster. A university spokesman did not respond to interview requests for the school’s president  James Clements  to explain why workouts were continuing. Athletic Director Dan Radakovich declined a similar request. While Clemson has extensive financial incentives to proceed with football and significant resources to put toward trying to keep its players healthy — it can more easily afford to test  contact trace and isolate its players than Morehouse — there is another subtext to the approaches by both schools: race. None But there is a different dynamic at schools whose big-time sports programs  with their opulent amenities and high salaries for coaches and athletic directors  are fueled by an unpaid and largely Black labor force. None “There’s a higher threshold to push the envelope with Black athletes and this is no different ” said Hasan Kwame Jeffries  an African-American history professor at Ohio State and a Morehouse alumnus. “It’s important to point out that we’re not talking about lacrosse and pistol here  we’re talking about football  which is disproportionately African-American  especially in the biggest conferences. Why are we even considering playing if we’re truly concerned with this being a disaster?” Or  as Billy Hawkins  a professor of health and human performance at the University of Houston  said of college football workouts continuing across the country while infections surge: “It’s a prime example of Black lives not mattering.” Players at the University of Arizona seem to have reached a similar conclusion after the school announced Tuesday that football workouts would continue despite President Robert C. Robbins saying recently that he would not allow on-campus classes if the fall semester were beginning now. None None None None None A decision on whether Howard’s game against Central State will be played at the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Sept. 6 will likely be made in early July  and the Bayou Classic  the annual game between Southern and Grambling State scheduled for Nov. 29  could be played on one of the school’s campuses instead of the Superdome  according to event organizers. Thus far  no schools in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference and the Southwestern Athletic Conference  which are made up of Division I H.B.C.U.s  have begun football workouts  according to the conference commissioners. Also  five Black colleges in North Carolina that for now have allowed football to go forward — North Carolina Central  North Carolina A&T  Shaw  Winston-Salem State and Fayetteville State — have canceled homecoming festivities that are centered around football games and draw tens of thousands of alumni. “There’s no way we could have a football game because even if we said there’s no homecoming  there would have been an organic homecoming ” said Thomas  who estimates that about 25 000 alumni turn out for the event at Morehouse each autumn. None “If we became an epicenter for it  it would be carried into communities that have less access to health care and more comorbidity indicators  so I’m very conscious of that ” Thomas said. None None None And perhaps the Arizona players are a start. “These are kids that play with broken bones  concussions — that’s the professional athlete mentality even if you’re not getting paid ” he said. “But I do wonder  in this moment that we’re in  if we’re very close to having a serious reckoning with race and college sports. It’s not a big leap for an athlete to say  ‘you value my humanity and you’re going to put me in this situation?’” “I would not be surprised  especially as these conversations of Black lives and dignity and worth continue  and are increasingly being captured and articulated by college athletes  that if Covid cases continue to increase in athletic facilities we hear them say  ‘nah  this doesn’t make any sense.’” None Still  he called Morehouse’s decision to call off football “gutsy” and “profound ” because the sport underpins the economic and cultural foundations of so many colleges. “That’s why it’s provocative to say  ‘no  we’re not going to do this  we’ll survive  we’ll bounce back ’” said Hawkins  who spent 20 years teaching at Georgia  a Southeastern Conference power. “It’s sad when the economic piece trumps the health and well-being of the students  but that’s capitalism — exploit the labor. So  a major piece is that it took an H.B.C.U. to come to this decision. If a school like Alabama or Georgia took the lead  that would be an amazing step.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-college-football-games-canceled.html,First Cancellations Emerge for Major College Football Advertisement Supported by Four games involving historically black colleges and universities were canceled  in part illustrating an economic difficulty for games played at neutral sites. None Four college football games involving historically black colleges and universities have been canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic  making them the first casualties of major college football leading up to a season that appears tenuous just over two months before its scheduled kickoff. Two neutral-site games — Southern University versus Tennessee State in Detroit on Sept. 5 and Jackson State versus Tennessee State a week later in Memphis — have been canceled along with Southern’s home game on Sept. 12 against Florida A&M. Jackson State also was forced to cancel its Sept. 5 season opener against Langston University  because Langston and other N.A.I.A. schools have been prohibited from playing before Sept. 12. Whether these cancellations are forerunners to more around the country — and at more powerful football programs — is uncertain  but they come as schools around the country are grappling with how to keep Covid-19 outbreaks from occurring as they push toward a season. Dozens of games have already been canceled at the lower levels of college football with Division II schools placing a 10-game limit on the season  and N.A.I.A. pushing its start date back two weeks  but these games are the first at the Division I level to be quashed. The N.C.A.A. Division I council approved a plan Wednesday that paved the way for teams to begin their seasons as scheduled  making no changes to the 29-day preseason practice period. “If I’m a student-athlete and I’m thinking about the fall  yeah  I do have a high level of concern ” said Mikki Allen  the athletic director at Tennessee State  who hopes to fill at least one of the two suddenly open spots on his schedule. None There are close to 30 games that were scheduled for neutral sites this season  ranging from marquee events that could influence the College Football Playoff selections — like Alabama playing Southern California in Arlington  Texas — to seasonal rituals  like when Georgia and Florida play in Jacksonville  Fla.  or the Grambling and Southern meeting in New Orleans on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Even before Wednesday  the pandemic had forced Notre Dame’s game with Navy  scheduled for Aug. 29 in Dublin to be relocated to the Naval Academy’s 34 000-seat stadium in Annapolis  Md. None As it becomes increasingly likely that fans will be limited — or prohibited — from attending  it is harder for third-party promoters to pencil out a profit. Consider Alabama’s game with U.S.C. on Labor Day weekend  one of two college games that the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones plans to host in September. If the game drew anywhere near the 81 359 that showed up for their season-opener there in 2016  Jones would reap upward of $16 million in ticket revenue alone  based on estimates from a price chart included in a game contract that lists rates for the public  starting at $100 for nosebleed seats. That plus parking — where some of the 12 000 spots go for $75 and up at Cowboys games — along with concessions  game merchandise  a 22 percent cut of each team’s merchandise  sponsorships  suites and event revenues should leave a tidy profit after paying Alabama its $6 million guarantee and U.S.C. likely a comparable amount. None In some cases  broadcast networks may ensure the games are played as scheduled. Dennis Thomas  the commissioner of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference  said that ESPN planned to still go forward with a game between one of his conference’s schools  South Carolina State  and Grambling  on Sept. 6 at the Atlanta Braves’ former stadium. “If you don’t have the backing of a multimedia company  the numbers are not going to make sense ” Thomas said. That turned out to be the case for the games in Detroit and Memphis. This was to have been the 31st edition of the Southern Heritage Classic  all but two of which have featured Jackson State and Tennessee State. Fred Jones  the event organizer  had built it into a three-day extravaganza for the historically black colleges  which are both about 210 miles from Memphis. The weekend was scheduled to kick off on Sept. 10 with a concert by Patti LaBelle with Jeffrey Osborne  and in the next two days would include a coaches’ luncheon  3-kilometer race  golf tournament  parade  fashion show  battle of the high school bands and an extravagant tailgating scene leading up to a Saturday night kickoff. Holding those events while adhering to social distancing guidelines became untenable. “When they tell you that events like what we have — the game  the parade  the tailgating — are super-spreaders and they tell you that’s a problem  you don’t have no other way to react ” said Jones  who as a 72-year-old black man with diabetes has a higher risk of severe illness if he catches the virus. Added Cheryl Parks Ajamu  the organizer of the Detroit Classic: “In Michigan  Covid-19 is the top concern and because our primary customer has the highest incidence of Covid-19  that’s a top priority.” The cancellations have left schools scrambling to fill holes in their schedule. Jackson State is working with Tennessee State to potentially move their game to Jackson  Miss.  on Sept. 5  and speaking with Florida A&M to fill its now open Sept. 12 date. Schools are also seeking to fill another hole in their budget: the two canceled games for Tennessee State were their two biggest paydays of the season — $400 000 for the game in Detroit and $350 000 for the one in Memphis. “I’ll say this ” said Allen  who was hired as the athletic director at Tennessee State in April. “Covid-19  in the spirit of athletics  has been a juggernaut opponent.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-college-football-waivers.html,"Welcome Back to Football (Terms and Conditions Apply) Advertisement Supported by On College Football With coronavirus waivers and a lack of testing data  universities leave athletes on their own. None You can say this about the college football industrial complex: it knows how to take care of its own. None To make him go away  the school sent Doyle off with a $1.1 million parting gift (along with 15 months of health benefits) — quite a bit more than the $15 000 settlement it paid one of the 13 players who ended up hospitalized in 2011 after one of Doyle’s punishing winter workouts. As for taking care of the unpaid help  that continues to be a different story. None None The idea came from Indiana University  whose meticulously detailed 17-page document includes which worker will be responsible for maintaining protocols at specific workout stations and what brands of disinfectant the school is using. It also includes a waiver that athletes are required to sign that alerts them that if they do not follow guidelines — like self-quarantining after a positive test or practicing social distancing — they can be dismissed from the team. The rough translation: wear a mask in public or lose your scholarship. None Whether or not such waivers would carry any legal weight — Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith said “I’m not sure it would stand up in a court of law"" — they are part of a trend among universities attempting to shift responsibility to their athletes rather than providing them safer conditions  said Dr. Kathleen Bachynski  an assistant professor of public health at Muhlenberg College. In this case  athletes who cannot join the team if they do not sign the waiver could be particularly vulnerable to coercion. “Their enrollment in college is so deeply tied to football that a student might feel obligated to sign whatever they’re handed so they can keep playing football ” said Bachynski  who added that similar pressures are why concussion symptoms are underreported in football. S.M.U. Athletic Director Rick Hart and Indiana Athletic Director Fred Glass did not respond to interview requests. But Smith  the Ohio State athletic director  said his school’s document is an attempt to manage the behavior of teenagers and young adults while they are away from football  so that they give themselves the best chance to play this fall. “You have to put yourselves in the shoes of a 17- or 18-year-old ” said Smith  adding that he worries only about the behavior of a small share of the 118 players on the football roster. “When they go to their apartment  we don’t control that environment. We don’t control what they do on the weekends. We don’t control what they do on July 4.” It is hard to know just how many schools are requiring such waivers — a Pac-12 Conference official said it was necessary to check with each school — but it figures to be many of the 130 schools that play at the Football Bowl Subdivision level if the practices mirror the way that schools are treating coronavirus testing data. Thus far  about a dozen schools have announced how many athletes or staff members have tested positive for the coronavirus since June 1  when the N.C.A.A. allowed colleges to open their facilities for workouts if allowed under local health guidelines. None But don’t expect anything near a full accounting. None None (Thus far  Houston is the only school to report that its cases were symptomatic.) None Of course  ethics and the business of college sports often have difficulty occupying the same space. None At the moment  it looks like this: being required to sign a “pledge” of all the things you will agree to do — monitor yourself for symptoms  quarantine after a positive test  follow the medical staff’s instructions  stay home if feeling sick  frequently sanitize your hands and keep personal and shared spaces clean. Nowhere does the two-page document detail any steps that are required from the school — like how a player in isolation would get food or medical treatment  or how frequently he and his teammates will be tested. Also  Ohio State is among the schools not releasing any testing data to the public. But the document does say that the virus is highly contagious and that Ohio State  which has opened its campus for essential programs like elective medical procedures  dental training  lab research and football  is following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Still  near the end  it cautions  “I can never be completely shielded from all risk of illness caused by Covid-19 or other infections.” In other words: sign here  you’re on your own.

Pressures Mississippi on Confederate Emblem on State Flag Advertisement Supported by The association’s expanded policy on the Confederate symbol came after the Southeastern Conference urged Mississippi to change its state flag. None ATLANTA — The National Collegiate Athletic Association effectively warned Mississippi on Friday that it would not hold major competitions there unless the Confederate battle emblem was stripped from the state flag. None None “There is no place in college athletics or the world for symbols or acts of discrimination and oppression ” Michael V. Drake  the chairman of the N.C.A.A.’s Board of Governors and the president of Ohio State  said in a statement. “We must continually evaluate ways to protect and enhance the championship experience for college athletes. Expanding the Confederate flag policy to all championships is an important step by the N.C.A.A. to further provide a quality experience for all participants and fans.” None None None Vowing to defend student-athletes and their opportunities for postseason play in Mississippi  he added  “It is time to change the flag. It is the right thing to do.” The most influential universities in the state — Mississippi  Mississippi State and Southern Mississippi — have distanced themselves from the flag for years  lowering it on their campuses and pressing officials in public and in private to change it. None Sankey’s announcement on Thursday represented an important public relations victory for the flag’s critics  who welcomed the statement from one of the South’s most prominent institutions. But Friday’s change from the N.C.A.A. threatened greater economic peril  in part because Mississippi has benefited from hosting postseason events whose locations are not chosen years in advance. (Some championship event locations are linked to seedings or rankings  not bids by potential host cities.) Just last year  Oxford and Starkville hosted games in the Division I baseball tournament. Starkville was also the site of some games in the Division I women’s basketball tournament. “It’s been said — kind of tongue in cheek  but maybe not so much — in years past that if they ever said Mississippi State or Ole Miss couldn’t hold a regional baseball tournament  you might get some action ” Greg Snowden  a former legislator who was the second-ranking Republican in the Mississippi House  said in an interview this week. “There would be teeth if the N.C.A.A. did something.” The N.C.A.A. has penalized states for their use of the battle flag for close to two decades  keeping major events with preselected locations away from places  like Mississippi  where the emblem was officially recognized. Only on Friday did a crucial carve-out vanish — that states could host championship competitions if their teams’ performances earned them a sufficiently high seeding or ranking. “We must do all we can to ensure that N.C.A.A. actions reflect our commitment to inclusion and support all our student-athletes ” Mark Emmert  the association’s president  said in a statement. “There can be no place within college sports where any student-athlete is demeaned or unwelcome.” None The Mississippi Legislature is poised to adjourn next week  but state officials could try to move a bill through the Capitol in short order. The Mississippi Constitution also gives Gov. Tate Reeves  a Republican who has signaled an openness to changing the flag  the power to convene a special session if he believes “the public interest requires it.” State officials could also choose to wait until next year to consider the flag’s fate.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/us/eyes-texas-racist-longhorn-football.html,Texas Football Players Call on University to Drop a Song Steeped in Racist History Advertisement Supported by “The Eyes of Texas ” once sung at minstrel shows  plays at football games and other sports events at the University of Texas at Austin. None For generations  students at the University of Texas at Austin have stood up at sports games  raised their right hand to form the symbol of the storied Texas Longhorns and belted out “The Eyes of Texas ” a campus anthem. Now  athletes including members of the university’s football team  which holds an exalted place in the campus culture  want the song gone. Unbeknown to many students and alumni  the song can be traced back to Robert E. Lee  the Confederate general  and was performed at minstrel shows in the early 20th century. On Friday  student-athletes referred to that troubled history when they called on the university to replace it with a song “without racists undertones.” It was among a long list of requests made by the athletes  who said that if their demands were not met  they would no longer help the university recruit new players or participate in donor events. None The department and university  they wrote  must take action “to make Texas more comfortable and inclusive for the black athletes and the black community that has so fervently supported this program.” None None “It is our duty to stand up against racism ” he added. None “I am always willing to have meaningful conversations regarding any concerns our student-athletes have ” Mr. Del Conte said. “We will do the same in this situation and look forward to having those discussions.” J.B. Bird  a spokesman for the university  said in an email that university officials were aware of the student-athletes’ list of requests. He said university officials “look forward to working with them and the UT community to create the best possible experience on our campus for Black students.” None Lee’s connection to the song came through William Prather  president of the University of Texas from 1899 to 1905. In the 1860s  Prather had been a student at Washington College  in Lexington  Va.  while Lee was the school’s president. Lee would always end remarks to Washington faculty members and students by saying “the eyes of the South are upon you ” according to Edmund T. Gordon  a professor in the University of Texas’ African and African diaspora studies department. Those remarks were most likely intended to remind students that the “tradition and the heritage of the South are watching over you and you should conform or engage in comportment that comes with that valiant tradition ” Professor Gordon said on Saturday. That notion  of the antebellum South as a pastoral paradise filled with gallantry  is known as the “Lost Cause” ideology  which seeks to play down the evils of slavery and cast the Confederacy’s cause during the Civil War as just and heroic  he added. None Students wrote satirical lyrics with the phrase and set them to the tune of “I’ve Been Working on the Railroad.” Its first performance was around 1903  by a university quartet at a minstrel show at the Hancock Opera House in Austin  the professor said. “The assumption is it was performed in blackface ” he said. None “Embracing the song’s meaning today should not stop us from seeing its complicated past  and acknowledging the many ways that people see the song ” it added. None “This is the first time that I know of that there has been relatively widespread support for having it not be the school song ” said Professor Gordon  who has been at the university for 30 years. None “We’re more than just people out there just banging our heads and hitting people ” he said. “We’ve got people who got beliefs and perspectives  and so as athletes  I think we should use that to the fullest ability.” On Friday  Mr. Sterns posted a message on Twitter  thanking people who have supported the team’s call for change.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-college-football-new-teams.html,An Early Audible for Colleges Starting New Football Teams Advertisement Supported by The coronavirus pandemic has lower-division and N.A.I.A. schools scrambling to adjust with far fewer resources than their bigger counterparts. None The posters promoting the inaugural football game at Madonna University started going up around its Livonia  Mich.  campus last October  and Josh DePaulis grabbed the first one he saw. He hung it on his bedroom wall  and every morning since  he has woken up  stared at it and said to himself two words: It’s coming. DePaulis  a quarterback  received offers from established programs in Divisions II and III  but so much about Madonna  an N.A.I.A. school  resonated with him. Throwing the program’s first touchdown pass. Beginning traditions instead of following them. Leading as a freshman. About three months remain until the season opener  which was pushed back two weeks to Sept. 12  and DePaulis’s coach  Brian Foos  has yet to see his quarterback play in pads or take a snap  control an offense or read a defense  call an audible or zip a pass into a tight spot. That all should have happened during spring practices  but the coronavirus pandemic halted Madonna’s debut season before it even started  thrusting plans into disarray. Madonna is one of four colleges at the N.C.A.A. and N.A.I.A. levels set to launch football this season  the culmination of a process that is expensive and cumbersome under even normal circumstances. But for these schools on the fringes of college sports’ vast machinery  which have heaved financial might and emotional energy into reaching this moment  the coronavirus pandemic has upended promises for a triumphant unveiling in a disproportionate  profound way. While Erskine College  in Due West  S.C.  is counting on the revenue generated from its four home games  its athletic director  Mark Peeler  said the economic impact of a truncated or canceled season  or one played with limited or no fans  would pale compared to the blow to morale and momentum. “That will definitely set us back financially  but it wouldn’t be nearly as devastating as just the concept of what we kind of started this for ” Peeler said. “We’ve embedded that day in people’s minds.” On his phone  Peeler marks the days until Sept. 5  when Division II Erskine — which dealt Florida State its only defeat in 1948 — is slated to play its first game since 1951. Shane Bell  a defensive lineman  said it was hard enough watching other teams play last season while he and his teammates sat out. He  too  had been counting down until the opener but stopped soon after the outbreak forced him to stay home. “I think I got a little bit depressed ” Bell said. “I was like  ‘I don’t need to count. We might not be playing anyway.’” The wait has also been difficult for Peeler  who unsuccessfully tried bringing football back to Erskine on at least two separate occasions. Massaging his approach  Peeler told the university president that football would be the only way to spur its growth  and in August 2018  Erskine reinstated its program as part of an extensive plan to boost enrollment  improve financial stability and cultivate a deeper sense of community  enticing students to remain on campus on the weekends. Peeler sensed the excitement at homecoming last autumn  when about 2 000 people  he said  attended practice and a tailgate. He was expecting far more to attend the spring scrimmage. To recapture that enthusiasm  Erskine redoubled its engagement efforts on social media and started doing football podcasts with guests like Coach Shap Boyd. “People who didn’t want to have anything to do with the college for many years now want to come back and check things out ” Peeler said. “It’s important to make sure that we keep the football program on people’s minds.” Though it’s unclear how the pandemic will affect Erskine’s enrollment  the hope  Peeler said  is that its student population will rise to 1 000  from about 800  by 2023. Adding football  he said  will net the school roughly an additional $1.5 million every year in tuition revenue (Division II schools have 36 scholarships to split among their football teams as they see fit  often with partial aid). Erskine had about 130 players during fall camp  which Boyd likened to elementary school. He spent most of it teaching  trying to get each player to follow the next. Now Boyd must distill the four weeks of lessons he had planned for the canceled spring practice and integrate it into preseason camp. “The depth of what we can install and what we can do is going to be limited greatly by our kids’ acumen ” Boyd said. “No one’s going to care that we’re playing freshmen — that’s the reality ” he added. “They’re looking at the schedule right now saying  ‘That’s a win ’ and we’re looking at the schedule saying  ‘Dang  we don’t even know.’” None Unlike their Division I counterparts  schools like Barton — where enrollment hovers around 1 000 — don’t have the staffing to implement coronavirus-related health measures  from temperature checks to frequent locker-room cleanings  and it could be financially burdensome to adopt those practices. Wilkinson  for one  indicated that he anticipated Barton assistants would assume responsibilities — laundry  perhaps — that otherwise would have fallen to support staff. “All these things  they’re going to be necessary ” Wilkinson said. “Can they be managed better at a Power 5 school? Probably. We’re a small private school. We’re going to have to find a way to pull it off.” None “Now the first time we run through a game is probably going to be our first game ” Wilkinson said. “That won’t be much of a scrimmage.” Barton was set to play 11 games this season before the N.C.A.A. mandated that Division II teams are permitted 10 at most. To comply  it had to drop one of its five home games in its new 3 500-seat stadium  Wilkinson said. Beyond that  the factory producing seat backs for the stadium’s premium section closed. And a delay in uniform production and delivery — to minimize costs  the school initially ordered only enough to outfit about 80 players — led Wilkinson to explore other options  such as whether schools with similar color schemes could assist. He recently texted Peeler  and together they commiserated over all the ordeals. Isn’t it great  Wilkinson wrote  to be starting a football program in the middle of a pandemic? “I was like  ‘Yes it is  brother ’” Peeler said. “We knew there would be a lot of bumps in the road. We didn’t know there would be a pandemic.” In a sport whose culture lionizes workaholics and teems with Type-A problem solvers  the uncertainty has been particularly vexing. Coaches are searching for answers that do not exist yet and perhaps will not for a while. Foos previously assisted at two other N.A.I.A. start-ups — Ohio Dominican and Lindsey Wilson  in Kentucky — and his experience no doubt helped him get the job at Madonna  in January 2019. But  he said with a laugh  he was not asked at his interview how he would guide a team through a public-health crisis  oversee players’ academic progress from afar or cope after a critical fund-raising drive was interrupted  generating about $15 000  far less than expected. Coaches have been meeting virtually with position groups and on Monday began installing schemes  easing the transition to training camp  which  Foos said  could look different from original plans. He is considering splitting the roster — about 140 players  he said — and holding a two-hour practice for each group  to maximize instruction and evaluation time. Players gathered on their own for 7-on-7 workouts to hone routes and develop chemistry. “But our guys don’t even know how to practice ” Foos said  “because we’ve never — they don’t even know where to line up for practice.” Ernest Jones  the athletic director at Florida Memorial University  lamented a similar situation. The cancellation of spring football after two practices prevented coaches from making a depth chart. Players were given workout plans  but many didn’t have access to equipment and Florida Memorial  a historically black N.A.I.A. university in Miami Gardens  doesn’t have the resources of Alabama  which sent its team Apple watches to monitor health and wellness. Jones said he hoped players were being diligent on their own. “Us losing the opportunity to compete  practice  train — yeah  it’s going to catch up to us ” Jones said. “But we have to figure out a way to give our kids a chance to compete. What can we do? This came  and we’re dealing with it.” In his final high school game  in October 2018  DePaulis sustained a spiral fracture of his left ankle  which required a rod and 13 screws to be inserted in his leg. As he pondered whether he would play again  what sustained him  during months of physical therapy and rehabilitation  was his opportunity at Madonna. Football  he said  is his life  and in these last few months  DePaulis has told himself not to waste any time  since that is something he doesn’t get to use more than once. The revisions to Madonna’s schedule have rendered the poster in his bedroom obsolete. Pending N.A.I.A. approval  the Crusaders will begin two weeks later than planned  on Sept. 12 instead of Aug. 29  against a different opponent  likely on the road and not at home. It will have been 23 months since DePaulis’s last football game. And so he uses the video game Madden NFL 20 to take mental reps. He gathers teammates new and old for 7-on-7 workouts and throws with his father in the backyard. He studies coverages and then sketches plays to beat them. In the middle of the night  when he can’t sleep  he’ll review defenses in the notebook he started keeping as a high school sophomore and then try drawing them from memory on the whiteboard in his bedroom. “My dream wasn’t to watch college football ” DePaulis said. “My dream is to play college football  and I’m just not going to let something that happened in the world that nobody can control take that away from me.” Advertisement ,articles/sports

None Mike Gundy  the winningest football coach in Oklahoma State’s history  apologized on Tuesday after he stirred outrage by wearing a T-shirt with the logo of a right-wing cable channel that aired commentary calling the Black Lives Matter movement “a farce.” None pic.twitter.com/x4mjK6v3UV None Although Hubbard quickly retreated from that threat  Oklahoma State and Gundy still faced substantial criticism  not least because the coach has been a persistently contentious figure in college football. Although Gundy has achieved remarkable successes on the field — his 2011 team  for instance  finished ranked No. 3 — his status became suddenly fragile after a fishing trip  apparently on Lake Texoma at the Texas-Oklahoma border this month  in which he donned a T-shirt promoting O.A.N. The network  which President Trump has often openly favored  has amplified conspiracy theories and been strident in its support of the administration. Gundy’s choice  memorialized in a photograph that appeared on Facebook  drew a swift backlash from within Oklahoma State’s locker room. “I will not stand for this ” Hubbard  the nation’s top rusher last season  wrote on Twitter. “This is completely insensitive to everything going on in society  and it’s unacceptable. I will not be doing anything with Oklahoma State until things CHANGE.” Teven Jenkins  an offensive lineman  said soon afterward that his unit supported Hubbard. And Justice Hill  who played at Oklahoma State before the Baltimore Ravens drafted him last year  said the university and its athletic department “need major change.” None “Once I learned how that network felt about Black Lives Matter  I was disgusted and knew it was completely unacceptable to me ” he said. “I want to apologize to all members of our team  former players and their families for the pain and discomfort that has been caused over the last two days.” Gundy  52  succeeded Les Miles in 2005 as the coach at Oklahoma State  where he played quarterback in college. Since then  he has won 129 games  including nine bowls  even as he sparked public relations headaches for administrators. None More recently  he drew attention when he said he pressed for a rapid return to normalcy during the coronavirus pandemic. He later apologized. After Gundy’s latest apology  Hubbard tweeted just six words: “A step in the right direction.” Advertisement ,articles/sports

That’s a painful word when you’re talking about matters of life and death.” None They knelt on campuses and outside courthouses and a capitol. They filmed videos and challenged coaches and gripped megaphones to call out racism they knew from their classrooms and stadiums. They led protest chants  registered voters and started to strategize for Nov. 3  Election Day. In some instances  the nation’s college athletes even pledged not to play. None “There are a lot of things we’re not going to stand for anymore ” Marvin Wilson  a defensive tackle at Florida State  said in an interview this week. “People are starting to realize we have a say-so in how this country should be run.” None In a shift that could alter the relationship between college activism and athletics  universities suddenly became willing to lend the power of their sports brands to social causes. And when players felt their schools had fallen short  university leaders found themselves challenged behind closed doors and  tellingly  sometimes in public. None None But the current effort gained one of its earliest and firmest footholds at Florida State. None But Florida State’s players knew Norvell had merely sent out a mass text message and followed up with only some players. Quickly  teammates pinged messages across a players-only chat to hatch a response. None The coach apologized at a team meeting hours later. The players pledged to register to vote and devote 10 hours each to community service  and they made plans to raise money for an African-American college scholarship fund and to help lower income students near the university in Tallahassee  Fla. “We used that to get everybody at the university and Coach Norvell’s attention ” said Wilson  who is projected as a top N.F.L. prospect. “And then we handled things behind closed doors.” Social media has provided a megaphone for athletes  who understand its potential power. A video Wilson posted after the meeting has been viewed more than 400 000 times. Former gymnasts at Alabama and Auburn  and former football players at Clemson  Iowa and Utah have used Twitter to describe racist behavior in their programs  leading to public apologies and several coaches being placed on leave. A post by Ashlynn Dunbar  a two-sport athlete at Oklahoma  telling fans not to support her on the court if they don’t support her right to speak out drew more than 40 000 likes. “It’s so powerful to be able to speak our minds and have people actually hear us ” said Dunbar  an all-Big 12 volleyball player who will play basketball next season while she finishes her master’s degree in college athletic administration. “I don’t have the biggest following  but the ability for people to share it with their friends who share it with their friends has allowed my voice to be heard farther than just the people I know.” Sometimes  powerful conversations are taking place in private. When Dabo Swinney  Clemson’s football coach  invited his 16 seniors to his home recently  he was asked to explain why he did not discipline an assistant coach when he learned several years ago that he had used a racial slur in conversation with a player. Darien Rencher  a senior running back  said that while Swinney told them his assistant was wrong  the timing made for “a sticky situation” — one that involved a familiar dynamic in college football  a sport in which more than 80 percent of Football Bowl Subdivision coaches in the 2018 season were white though nearly half of the players were black. Rencher  who described the conversation as a family talk  said topics “that are kind of touchy were able to be talked about behind the scenes that gave us all perspective.” The door had been cracked  at least a bit  by players of the past. Members of Howard’s 1936 football team staged a strike over a lack of food. There have been demonstrations over living conditions  the Vietnam War and civil rights. In one episode in 1969  Wyoming’s coach dismissed 14 black athletes who wanted to demonstrate during a game against Brigham Young. None “It’s sporadic  but when it happens  it can be widespread and have a major impact ” said Lane Demas  a history professor at Central Michigan and the author of “Integrating the Gridiron: Black Civil Rights and American College Football.” “Today  more than ever  players understand the power they have.” Few appreciate that shift more than Ramogi Huma  the executive director of the National College Players Association  the closest thing that college players have to a formal advocate. Huma was a senior linebacker at U.C.L.A. in 1998 when the African-American players on the unbeaten football team met with the school’s Black Student Union  which brought a powerful speaker: John Carlos  whose black-gloved  raised-fist salute with Tommie Smith at the 1968 Olympics remains an iconic moment of the civil rights era. The organization asked the players to use their platform of a nationally televised game to protest Proposition 209  a ballot measure that had amended California’s Constitution to prohibit universities from considering race or gender in admissions  which caused black enrollment to plummet at U.C.L.A. The players settled on wearing black wristbands. When Bob Toledo  U.C.L.A.’s coach  got wind of the protest planned for the final game of the regular season at Miami  he argued that the players should stand down  according to Huma  and found a reason that struck a nerve: that Southern sportswriters might not vote the Bruins into the national title game. The issue was so contentious that the team canceled its usual meetings the night before the game to instead discuss the protest. The Bruins nixed their plans and then lost  ruining their shot at a national championship. Coaches  Huma said  blamed the protest idea and  he added  one white player shouted across the locker room  “I don’t want to hear a damn thing about those wristbands anymore.” “It was similar to the reaction to Colin Kaepernick when it was very clear he was trying to raise the issue of police brutality ” Huma said of the rift. “Things that are important to African-Americans in a sports setting get labeled a distraction. That’s a painful word when you’re talking about matters of life and death.” None “We can’t walk away because we know that people will disagree with us ” Gene Smith  Ohio State’s athletic director  once one of two black men running a Football Bowl Subdivision program  said. “If it’s right  then we stand tall  and we accept whatever negatives come with it.” None None “Many of our teammates ” the statement said  “are inconsolable as yet another Black life has been taken at the hands of law enforcement and injustice.” They announced a push to promote voter registration and to take people to the polls in November. In wanting action — and not just words “where it’s one time  we put it out and forget it ” as Locksley said — the Maryland players are not unique. Some  like Florida State’s Wilson and his teammates  have grand ambitions in their community. Others  like athletes at Wisconsin  asked administrators and coaches to review hiring practices and provided reading and movie lists on topics of racial injustice. The most elementary step gaining traction has been simple: to vote. When Georgia Tech’s men’s basketball team gathered over Zoom  each participant was asked to express his emotions in two words. Players described being “frustrated ” “angry” and “tired.” The two words for Eric Reveno  a 54-year-old white assistant coach  were “embarrassed” and “disgusted.” That night  Reveno stewed on something that Malachi Rice  one of the team’s leaders  had said: that too many people protest injustice but do not bother to vote. Reveno woke up the next morning with an idea: that the N.C.A.A. should ban athletic activities on Election Day to encourage its more than 460 000 athletes to vote. No practice  no meetings  no games. In response  the N.C.A.A.’s powerful Board of Governors said Friday afternoon that it was encouraging its member schools to make Nov. 3 a day off for athletic activities. None Before the association’s statement  U.C.L.A. had announced voter education sessions for all 25 of its teams  and Georgia Tech said nine of its in-season teams  including football  would not hold mandatory activities on Election Day. Reveno said support with words was “not enough.” “We teach them financial literacy — the power of interest over time  the dangers of credit card debt  about how much that daily latte is costing them ” Reveno said. “What about investing in your community so that your kid’s life is shaped more the way you wanted? Being an engaged and active citizen is the most powerful thing we do as an American.” Increasingly  the nation’s college athletes are acting on this. None “It sent a message that people don’t really care about what we have to say ” she said. “They just care about what we do on the court. Obviously  that hurts — especially as a young black person trying to find their identity.” But there is a shift  she said  something that she sensed profoundly when she attended a march in her hometown  Houston  where Floyd’s family members spoke. There is an opportunity that did not previously exist  she said. It comes not from a louder voice  but from an audience that is ready to listen. “It’s different speaking about things ” Dotson said. “And then wanting to be heard.” Advertisement ,articles/sports

After the race  Abt was disqualified for “sporting misconduct.” In a statement  he owned up to using “outside help.” “I would like to apologize to Formula E  all of the fans  my team and my fellow drivers for having called in outside help during the race on Saturday ” said Abt  of Germany. “I did not take it as seriously as I should have.” None Several of Abt’s fellow racers had spoken up with suspicions about his surprisingly good performance. “Really not happy here  because that was not Daniel driving the car himself  and he messed up everything.

Championship  a major  was moving to October from June. Five other L.P.G.A. events were canceled. None There have now been nine L.P.G.A. tournaments canceled  although the shortened L.P.G.A tournament schedule will mean an increase in prize money for several events  with the average purse growing to $2.7 million per competition.

None In a conference call with reporters Wednesday afternoon  Whan said that when tournaments resumed he expected tour players and caddies to be tested for the coronavirus regularly. Whan added that such testing  “could be available in large supply by the end of May.” The Women’s P.G.A. Championship  originally scheduled for June 25-28 at the Aronimink Golf Club outside Philadelphia  has been postponed until Oct. 8-11 at the same site. Suzy Whaley  the P.G.A. of America president  called the four-month postponement  “a prudent choice.” If you’re more of a baseball fan  you might be surprised to learn that in cricket  the spitball is absolutely legal. But that may now change in the wake of the coronavirus. None Rather than ban tampering with the ball entirely  the new rules would allow players to use artificial substances instead of spit  like shoe polish or wax. The change is significant: Using foreign substances on the ball has long been forbidden in the game. At the start of cricket games  the new ball is clean and shiny and tends to benefit bowlers  who can get it to move as it approaches the batters. But as the game progresses and the ball becomes scuffed up  it becomes harder to do so  and batters can get the edge. So bowlers do what they can to keep the ball nice and shiny: rub it on their sweaters  moisten it with sweat  and  yes  spit on it.

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-crickets.html,Letter of Recommendation: Crickets Advertisement Supported by Letter of Recommendation None Insects had the earth about 400 million years before we did. For centuries stacked on centuries  what a great whirling  stirring buzz it must have been: the pulsing thrums of cicadas  tiny whine of mosquitoes and droning hum of bees. Though it has certainly quieted down a bit during the past few hundred years  every night the persistent cricket presses on. Stubborn stridulating cricket! Chirp  chirp  chirp  as if nothing has changed for millenniums. A field cricket lazes all day in its burrow. Then  in the evening  just when you’re ready to relax  out comes the well-rested cricket with its own built-in instrument  ready to make a ruckus. The instrument is in two parts: on the top of the lower wing a rough blade called a scraper  on the underside of the upper wing a row of bumps  like teeth. Scraper saws teeth. And scraper saws teeth. And scraper saws teeth. Males of the more than 900 species the world over sing primarily to win a mate — and to ward off competition. They’ll do anything to be heard. One species of cricket in the tropics slaps up a mud wall around the mouth of its burrow  leaving a small gap where it can stand and call. This earthen megaphone amplifies the song to an earsplitting volume. Though crude  this audio technology competes  worrisomely  with the best of our own such designs. The tree cricket can’t eke out many decibels on its puny  papery wings. So from a leaf it gnaws out a hole the shape of a pear  then jams its body through so its wings fit against the edge and — voilà — the volume’s turned up by a factor of four. None None Though it seems like a lot of noise  perhaps if a cricket was given the chance  he would defend his music the way Iggy Pop defended punk rock to a dismissive television journalist in 1977. It is “music that takes up the energies and the bodies and the hearts and the souls and the time and the minds of young men who give what they have to it and give everything they have to it ” he said. “What sounds to you like a big load of trashy old noise is in fact the brilliant music of a genius — myself. And that music is so powerful that it’s quite beyond my control. When I’m in the grips of it  I don’t feel pleasure and I don’t feel pain. ... Do you understand what I’m talking about?” When evening comes  I turn down Iggy Pop on the stereo and step outside for a different sort of concert. Though cricket song does take up the energies and bodies and hearts and souls and time and minds of young males  crickets — unlike Iggy Pop — do not like an audience. They will not perform antics for us. Try to get in the front row  and suddenly the show will end. The best strategy for getting a good seat is not to mill about  beer sloshing around and spilling  but to take a seat anywhere and sit back. Anywhere  because the sound will surround you no matter where you are. It is good to lay a blanket out  for the big load of trashy old noise that is the nightly cricket concert  while at first a fire-in-the-heart wide-eyed jamboree soon enough can send you into stargazing reverie  and soon thereafter to sleep. So I’ve heard. Starting out  a few squeak meekly as a breeze rustles the long grasses. A flock of geese  also stalwarts of the old cacophonous order  might go honking and flapping and honking and flapping and honking and flapping across the sky in an unruly shifting vee  stealing the show awhile. Then the pale pinks and yellows of sky darken to plush purples and bruised blues  and the crickets start to amp it up. Then it is full dusk  and you begin to feel at last overtaken  surrounded  for Venus is now making herself known  throwing you into an inevitable  crushing confrontation with other revolving bodies  reminding you  after a long day of managing to drown out such distractions  that you are on a planet spinning wildly  careering around a greasy galactic track  tilting this way and that to the tune of insects raking their wings against wings. The trill is deafening now  looping and thrumming. You are in the mosh pit of the universe — not at all at the center but another thrashing body in the dark pit  knocked about in glorious  sweaty chaos — wounded  an outcast  but belonging here nonetheless in this squawky  grating orbit. The noise! The rapturous noise! Then  softly  there comes a swirling in your innermost heart  the long-gone stars spooling out ancient silvery light to beat all your best efforts at ignoring such trifles. And now your body is a warm hum. You are a quiet pulse  your even breath rising and falling. And now you are in the full thick dark drifting into dream with the chirp  chirp  chirping.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/sports/baseball/its-not-cricket-but-its-a-ballgame-in-australia.html,It’s Not Cricket  but It’s a Ballgame in Australia Advertisement Supported by None PERTH  Australia — More than 10 000 miles from his home in chilly New England  Pawtucket Red Sox Manager Kevin Boles tucked a stopwatch into his sweatshirt pocket and clocked the first pitch of the game between his Perth Heat and the Canberra Cavalry. It was 80 degrees  a typical December day.  “It should be an absolute ripper ” one of the online commentators for the Australian Baseball League predicted earlier in the week. “And if Canberra can get over the line  they’ll have won four on the trot”— Australian for a four-game winning streak. Managed by Boles in his off-season months  the Perth Heat play in what may be the world’s most isolated professional baseball stadium  a cozy 1 000-seat park just inland from a distant stretch of Indian Ocean coastline closer to Singapore than to Sydney. On what became a windy night with an orange sunset here in early December  the game proceeded without the baritone beer vendors or Let’s-Make-It-Loud! jumbotron exhortations of the United States. Instead  the whistling of passing trains and the chirping of crickets provided a distinctive soundtrack to the infield chatter and the slaps of balls hitting mitts. In this fraternal twin of small-town American summer  nearly half of the Australian Baseball League’s players hail from minor league systems in the United States  almost all of them in search of extra experience during the off-season. The connection seems appropriate  since Major League Baseball  in 2010  took a 75 percent ownership stake in the A.B.L.  reviving a defunct league whose collapse had diminished the sport’s popularity here. In other words  American influence in Australian baseball now runs pretty deep. What that will eventually mean remains to be seen. Since American baseball first expanded internationally  it has become ingrained in places like South Korea and Japan. But in Australia  the sport has generally stayed on the fringes. “Baseball has never quite been ingrained in the fabric of Aussie culture ” said Alex Pellerano  director of baseball operations for the A.B.L. He added: “Almost every single kid plays at least some T-ball in Australia. But what happens is 99 percent of them will never play again — they’ll leave and play rugby and cricket and other sports.” Still  Pellerano and other A.B.L. officials speak optimistically about their league’s recent progress  and cite rising numbers in Little League participation in Australia and increased live streaming of A.B.L. games. A.B.L. officials said their hope was that with the support of Major League Baseball  they could produce a stronger pipeline of Australian players (more than two dozen have made it to the majors over the years)  improve local baseball facilities and create a slow but steady increase of local interest. But the reality for Australian baseball at the moment is a small six-team league with stadiums far from city centers  scarce TV coverage and the knowledge that a big chunk of the league’s players will soon leave  headed back to the United States for spring training. For a lot of the native Australian players  most of whom grew up in the youth system that M.L.B. hopes to strengthen  a primary goal remains a very local one — to capture the Claxton Shield  the country’s longstanding baseball prize. Created in 1934  the shield is a survivor of leagues that have come and gone. Since 2010  it has been awarded to the winner of the A.B.L. It can currently be found in the beer lounge at each Perth Heat home game  propped up against a corrugated metal wall  a testament to the team’s back-to-back championships. Between innings at that early December game  the few fans in the lounge took no selfies or group photos of the shield. They were more interested in strolling toward the hot-dog stand as the public address system overhead spat out a subdued rendition of the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.” At the same time  shuffling cheerfully along the ballpark’s concrete concourse  between packs of giddy Little Leaguers and a beer-bellied Mr. Met look-alike  Bill Sinclair  Perth baseball’s elder statesman  surveyed the scene. These days  Sinclair  79  spends a good deal of time outfitted in customized Perth Heat superfan livery while he sells fund-raising tickets for the team. Known around the ballpark as Spider  he also distributes packs of cards that depict his journey from player in 1953 to coach in 1957 to mainstay in the Australian umpiring ranks from 1960 until his retirement this year. For Sinclair  it has been a long and enduring relationship with a sport that first made itself known in Australia during the 1800s. Now  more than a century later  it is promoting itself here with live-stream ads built around American all-star cameos: “Hi  this is Mike Trout with the Los Angeles Angels  and you’re watching the A.B.L.”  As for the city of Perth itself  it calls to mind Gulf Coast Florida  with a midsize downtown skyline  glaring sunlight  a salty sea breeze and a population just over a million. On the other hand  cars drive on the left  the swans here are black and professional baseball runs in a condensed 56-game season from October to February. And while the A.B.L.’s league office tries to distribute players as equitably as possible  teams here have kept up their own longstanding agreements with major league clubs in the United States  de facto affiliations that do not always equate to fair competition. The Perth Heat  for example  have dominated the A.B.L. in recent years after having maintained strong relationships with several major league farm systems. “We go back with the Baltimore Orioles till about ’91 ” said Geoff Hooker  the longtime Perth Heat chairman and newly appointed chief executive officer of the league. “They actually listen to us — and we always say to send the cool guys over  however they see fit  which is actually important in spreading the game’s popularity.” Hooker added  “They tend to love it here.” Most notably  Tampa Bay Rays center fielder Kevin Kiermaier played one season for the Canberra Cavalry  and Didi Gregorius provided the first at-bat of the new A.B.L before moving on to replace Derek Jeter as the starting shortstop on the Yankees. As for Boles  the Pawtucket manager moonlighting in Perth  the A.B.L. can be complicated. He has to manage a group of players with diverse talent and immensely different backgrounds. He has to make sure to speak once a week with the major league farm directors in the United States who have sent him their prospects. More than anything  he has to be flexible. “I have to mix and match with the Aussies and Americans to make sure they all touch the field and accomplish what they’re here for ” he said. One of his players  the Colorado Rockies prospect Correlle Prime  opted to come to Perth after a disappointing minor league season. “Everyone is aware of the league and that Perth is a good place ” Prime said.  He added  “There’s like a 13-hour time difference  but my mom watches every single game on the live stream and the archives.” The league may have reached a turning point in 2011 when Perth hosted the league all-star game  an event that secured widespread TV coverage and drew increased levels of financial support from the Australian government. And in 2014  Sydney hosted M.L.B.’s first games of the regular season — the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. the Arizona Diamondbacks  at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Clayton Kershaw pitched the opener before nearly 40 000 people. All good  and now the A.B.L. is hoping to institute a game-of-the-week TV plan  restore a dwindling volunteer base and receive more government support if baseball is reinstated for the 2020 Olympics in Japan. Still  on the ground here in Perth  a $1.5 billion stadium is rising over the sandy banks of the Swan River  just behind the shoulder of the city’s downtown. Surrounded by a fleet of construction cranes  the half-finished Perth Stadium will  in a few years  house several sports  including the increasingly popular Big Bash League  a brand of cricket that eschews the days-long endurance tests of the traditional game in favor of shorter  faster bouts. It is a reminder of the pecking order in Australian sports  but those who love baseball plan on letting cricket be cricket and hope that they can find a durable spot for themselves in the bright  hot sun of the lucky country.

https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/02/world/americas/02iht-jamaica.1.5108839.html,"Cricket: In Jamaican politics  cricket always wins Advertisement Supported by None None But Simpson-Miller  who doubles as the nation's sports minister  sure doesn't act that way sometimes. She recently donned cricket apparel  complete with shin protectors  gloves and a bat  for a newspaper advertisement promoting the tournament  which is being played in Jamaica and on eight other Caribbean islands. In the ad  she appeared to be making solid contact with the ball  perhaps even propelling her side to victory. Simpson-Miller  known widely as ""Sista P "" has also been lacing her political speeches these days with cricket vernacular. Just listen to her at a recent rally here in the capital  called to energize her party's faithful for coming elections: ""We have many wickets to take "" she exclaimed  prompting the People's National Party activists gathered before her to jump up and down with glee. ""I have the strength to swing the bat "" she added later  eliciting even more raucous behavior from the audience. ""Your captain is ready "" she declared  bringing about full-fledged pandemonium. Then she uttered the word ""six "" which in cricket is the equivalent of a grand slam home run in baseball  prompting her backers to completely lose control. The conference room where she spoke took on the rowdy air of Sabina Park  where the Windies beat Pakistan  Zimbabwe and Ireland early in the tournament. Some in the crowd held both hands in the air  three fingers out on each hand  giving a cricket referee's signal for a ""six."" Simpson-Miller is hardly the only Jamaican politician to go cricket-crazy. The late Michael Manley  who served for two periods as prime minister  from 1972 to 1980 and from 1989 to 1992  also representing the People's National Party  set sports records as a schoolboy. And he was the author of ""A History of West Indies Cricket "" which explored the ties between the game and Caribbean nationalism. Not to be outdone  Manley's longtime rival  Edward Seaga of the Jamaica Labor Party  who was prime minister from 1980 to 1989  was a boyhood cricket player and member of the Kingston Cricket Club. He recently recounted his love of wicketkeeping and his two favorite shots  the pull and the hook. It was Simpson-Miller's predecessor  P.J. Patterson  who played a crucial role in bringing the World Cup to the Caribbean this year  the first time the islands have been the host of the tournament since it began in 1975. The West Indies won that first cup  incidentally  and managed to win the second one  too. When Patterson stepped down last year and Simpson-Miller  using the slogan ""Come to Mama "" beat three male competitors within the ruling party to take the post of prime minister  she inherited the big event. And she is making the most of it. As the party chairman  Robert Pickersgill  told The Gleaner  Jamaica's principal newspaper  recently  ""With the bounce we are now getting from the cricket  the opposition is stumped."" The Gleaner took umbrage at the remark and suggested that politics had better stay off the cricket pitch. ""Hosting cricket  we assumed  was a national rather than a partisan matter "" the paper said. ""Any government that decided to spend upward of $120 million on the event would have done so because they believe it would be good for Jamaica."" That spending has been criticized by Bruce Golding  the leader of the opposition. He has suggested that the money that went to build a new stadium would have been better spent upgrading the hospitals  which lack basic medicines  or supporting the police  who often have no transportation to get to the scene of a crime quickly. Simpson-Miller's government  however  has argued that the effects of cricket will be long-lasting. There has been some disappointment with ticket sales  and the flood of tourists that had been expected never materialized. But Simpson-Miller notes that the pretournament refurbishment that Jamaica received will not go away when the cup is awarded - hopefully to the Windies  of course. She has not let on when she will call elections  although she is obligated to do so by October. Cricket has clearly been a factor in the scheduling. The conventional wisdom when she took over in February 2006 was that she would set the date soon to take advantage of her enormous popularity as the island's first female prime minister. But she delayed  and then a financial scandal hit her party when it was discovered that a Dutch-based commodities firm  Trafigura Beheer BV  which does business with the government  had secretly donated nearly a half-million dollars to her campaign. With the World Cup looming  her advisers decided that a delay in the election would be the best strategy  allowing her to benefit from the frenzy surrounding the tournament. Whether that calculation will work is uncertain. Her popularity has dropped considerably over the last year as the opposition has smeared her government as corrupt and ineffectual. And tying her fortunes to cricket carries risk. The Windies  after winning their first three matches  have dropped contests with Australia and New Zealand in Antigua. On Sunday  playing in Guyana  the Windies lost to Sri Lanka. Taking the tournament appears to be a long shot. And on top of that  the killing of Bob Woolmer  the Pakistani cricket coach  on March 18  after his team lost a key match against Ireland and was ousted from the World Cup  has filled newscasts and front pages with the kinds of death-in-paradise stories that Jamaica hates. Simpson-Miller acknowledged to reporters recently that the killing had ""cast a pall"" over the tournament. But in the next breath  she expressed confidence in the investigation  which has produced no suspects  and discussed the fact that the best way to honor Woolmer is to focus on the game he loved. She is certainly taking her own advice. Here is another excerpt from her political speech  delivered in her typical rousing style: ""Get out there and prepare the field to ensure that when I call the match  when I win the toss  when I elect to bat first  we're ready.""

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/sports/hockey/jarome-iginla-2020-nhl-hall-of-fame.html,Jarome Iginla Headlines 2020 Hockey Hall of Fame Class Advertisement Supported by Iginla  the fourth black person selected to the hall  joins inductees Marian Hossa  Kevin Lowe  Doug Wilson  Canadian women’s goaltender Kim St. Pierre and longtime general manager Ken Holland. None Like most kids growing up in Edmonton  Jarome Iginla admired Oilers legends Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier. As a young black hockey player  he paid particular attention when he saw someone in the N.H.L. who looked like him in Grant Fuhr. Iginla idolized Fuhr  cherishing their pictures taken together over the years  and soon will join him in the Hockey Hall of Fame. The longtime Calgary Flames captain headlined the hall’s six-person 2020 class Wednesday  making it in his first year of eligibility. Iginla will be the fourth black player inducted after Fuhr  women’s hockey pioneer Angela James and Willie O’Ree. Iginla and Fuhr are the only black N.H.L. players enshrined for their on-ice accomplishments  while O’Ree was chosen in the builder category in 2018 for breaking the league’s color barrier 60 years earlier. “I didn’t view myself in minor hockey as a black hockey player but I was also aware that I was ” Iginla said. “It really was special to me to see the black players that were in the N.H.L. — to see Grant Fuhr starring  to be able to say to other people: ‘Look at Grant Fuhr. He’s an All-Star.’ And to see Claude Vilgrain and Tony McKegney and to have answers for the other kids. It was very  very important for me following my dreams.” None “The pressure in those games  in the do-or-die games especially  it’s pretty awesome ” Iginla said. “You’re playing for your teammates. It’s for your country. You feel like so many people are watching. You’re trying to carry on the tradition.” The 18-member selection committee voted remotely for the first time because of travel difficulties posed by the coronavirus pandemic. It is unclear if the hall will hold its traditional in-person induction ceremony  tentatively scheduled for Nov. 16. Iginla was joined in the 2020 class by winger Marian Hossa  defensemen Kevin Lowe and Doug Wilson  Canadian women’s goaltender Kim St. Pierre and longtime general manager Ken Holland. In addition to two Olympic gold medals in three appearances  Iginla won the Maurice “Rocket” Richard Trophy twice as the N.H.L.’s top goal-scorer and in 2002 won the Art Ross Trophy for the most points and Ted Lindsay Award as M.V.P. voted by fellow players. He also won the Canadian junior Memorial Cup twice and world juniors  world championship and World Cup of Hockey once each. A power forward on the wing with a prolific scoring touch  Iginla had 625 goals and 675 assists for 1 300 points in 1 554 regular-season N.H.L. games for the Calgary Flames  Colorado Avalanche  Pittsburgh Penguins  Boston Bruins and Los Angeles Kings. He had 68 points in 81 playoff games and most notably led Calgary to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final in 2004. Hossa was also elected in his first year of eligibility and joins 2015 inductee Chris Pronger as the only players to go into the hall while still under contract. Like Pronger  Hossa qualified because he hasn’t played in three years  he retired in 2018 because of a skin disorder. A skilled  two-way winger  Hossa won the Stanley Cup with Chicago in 2010  2013 and 2015. He lost in the final in 2008 and 2009  had 149 points in 205 playoff games and finished with 1 134 points in 1 309 regular-season games with the Ottawa Senators  Atlanta Thrashers  Penguins  Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks. “Going through the failures make you stronger ” said Hossa  who joins Slovak countrymen Stan Mikita and Peter Stastny as Hall of Famers. “Maybe for me  the third time’s the charm. Not just in the final winning the Stanley Cup but also being the third Slovak.” Lowe and Wilson had to wait more than 20 years to be inducted. Wilson  who won the Norris Trophy as the league’s top defenseman in 1982 and retired in 1993 said: “Timing never meant a thing to me. That’s an understatement. Worth the wait.” Lowe won the Cup six times — five times with the Oilers and once with the New York Rangers in 1994. Hall chairman Lanny McDonald joked to Lowe  “You only won six Stanley Cups  you selfish rascal you.” St. Pierre will be the eighth woman in the hall and the first female goaltender. After wanting to be like Montreal Canadiens Hall of Fame goaltender Patrick Roy  she traded in her figure skates for goalie equipment and backstopped Canada to three Olympic gold medals and five world championship titles. “Being the only girl  it was never easy ” said St. Pierre  who played in boys leagues until she was 18. “I had to really fight every day not to become the best but just to play amongst all the boys. But I think it made me the person I am today to never give up and just to always be ready every time I had a chance to step on the ice.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/sports/hockey/nhl-draft-lottery-alexis-lafreniere.html,The First Pick in the N.H.L. Draft Goes to … TBD Advertisement Supported by The N.H.L. held the first of two lotteries to determine the 2020 draft order but  in a confounding reveal  did not name the team that will select first over all. None The National Hockey League on Friday held the first part of its draft lottery  an annual ritual of pro sports leagues meant to lay out an order of business for the rest of the draft process. The night’s primary revelation  however  was that this year’s draft order is still as incomplete as the season itself. Even the one thing the draft order was supposed to finalize — the destination of the consensus No. 1 pick Alexis Lafrenière — remains unknown after the N.H.L. revealed seven teams that will select in the second through eighth spots  but held up a card bearing the N.H.L. shield as a placeholder for the franchise that will win the first overall pick in another draft lottery. Phase 2 of the league’s selection process will be held between the qualifying and first rounds of the playoffs  with no date set yet. None “It’s a little strange when they flip it over and you have to process that there’s a secondary lottery that’s going to take place  or a ‘Phase 2 ’ and not necessarily knowing the exact teams ” said Rob Blake  the general manager of the Los Angeles Kings  the franchise which will select second over all. “Everything has kind of taken a different path since the pause and you maneuver your way around it.” The No. 1 pick will be selected from among the eight teams that do not advance past the qualifying round of the playoffs  or the teams that acquire those picks via trade  with each pick from a losing team representing a 12.5 percent chance at top overall selection. The Ottawa Senators will select third over all  having acquired the pick in a trade with the San Jose Sharks  and fifth with their own pick. The Devils will pick seventh but also own two picks of potential play-in losers  Arizona and Vancouver. The Detroit Red Wings  who had the league’s worst record  hold the fourth pick. The Anaheim Ducks (6th) and Buffalo Sabres (8th) round out the portion of the draft order that was completed Friday. In a season that has seen play suspended  players test positive for the coronavirus and the league being creative in planning the summertime start of the playoffs from two hub cities still yet to be determined  it came as no surprise that the N.H.L. draft and draft lottery have also been subject to unusual circumstances. The draft itself will be a fall event and the combine appears to be on course to not take place at all. When the draft does happen  there is an excellent chance it will be held remotely  as the N.F.L.  W.N.B.A. and M.L.B. have already done this spring. It will be headlined by Lafrenière  an 18-year-old wing who cemented his status as the top prospect by winning his second straight player of the year honor in the Canadian junior system  a feat matched only by the three-time Stanley Cup champion Sidney Crosby. Lafrenière played for the same club  Oceanic Rimouski  as Crosby did. Lafrenière excelled most prominently at the Under-20 World Junior Championships in January  scoring 10 points in five games and leading Canada to a gold medal. He was named most valuable player of the tournament. He headlines a deep 2020 draft class that is bracing for the unique and sometimes confusing circumstances wrought by the pandemic. Jamie Drysdale  who is expected to be the first defenseman selected  said: “I’m not going to lie  it’s a bit weird. I’ve played with some older guys and heard what they had to say about their draft day. Obviously this is going to be different. Everyone’s just waiting on when the draft is going to be  but for now it’s just a matter of preparing myself for anything.” Forward Cole Perfetti  a projected top-10 pick  said he had to recalibrate his expectations for the moment that he longed for since growing up in Whitby  Ontario. “You dream of having a draft day the same as every other pick: walking up onstage  getting the jersey and taking your photo ” Perfetti said. “Those are experiences and memories that we’re not going to get  but we’re going to get different ones.” Quinton Byfield  a 6-foot-4-inch and 215-pound center projected by many as the draft’s second pick  had planned to buy a striking suit and wear one of his signature bow ties — he has a collection of dozens — but said he was unsure if he would display such sartorial flair from his living room. Byfield  whose father is from Jamaica and whose mother is Canadian  could become the highest selected black player in league history. Columbus defenseman Seth Jones currently holds the distinction  having been selected fourth in the 2013 draft. “If I got drafted that high  being the highest player drafted with black heritage  that would definitely be special  making a mark in history like that ” Byfield said. Beyond the dizzying format changes and unforeseen delays to the N.H.L. season  the process of evaluating prospects was thrown into flux after the N.C.A.A.  amateur leagues in North America and professional leagues in Europe canceled their seasons. The Under-18 World Junior Championships  which had been scheduled for April 16-26 were also canceled  a loss that Blake  the Kings general manager  particularly lamented. “That’s where the collection of these players get to play peer versus peer and you get to watch it ” he said  “and see the difference from the beginning of the year to the end of the year what they’d done.” Martin Madden  the assistant general manager for the Anaheim Ducks  said that his staff members tried hard to keep their number of viewings for each prospect at the same level it would have been for a full season. That meant deep video dives and conducting remote interviews with players as his scouts prepared as if the original June draft date would be kept. Around the league  interviews with prospects are being conducted by videoconference  a departure from the rigid schedule at the annual combine  where interviews are usually timed to last around 15 minutes or can include many players in groups. Without a standardized length and with an unlimited number of participants — including executives  coaches and scouts — the process this year is allowing both team officials and players to get more profound looks at one another. “The whole process of teams doing Zoom interviews with prospects was an opportunity for teams to really get to know players beyond what they’ve been able to do in the past ” said player agent Allan Walsh. Some felt that the unusual circumstances would have a distinct impact on evaluating players and  ultimately  where prospects were selected. Walsh said the steep development curve of prospects meant they may have made serious strides between the suspension of play in March and the draft this fall. How fast a player may have developed is just one of the many unknowns the N.H.L. is facing in a year that’s cloudier than usual. Advertisement ,articles/sports

None “It was incumbent on us seven to get together and try to put our heads together on how to try to create  promote and manufacture real change when it comes to racism in our sport and racism in society as well ” Kane  who is black  said in a telephone interview.

Kim Davis  the league’s executive vice president for social impact  expressed hope that it would work collaboratively in the future. “We are supportive of all efforts that are intended to advance the role of our sport in society ” Davis said in an email. “We are hopeful that this alliance will collaborate with our N.H.L. structured council and committees — particularly the Players Inclusion Committee — to bring ideas for change.” Other players of color joining Aliu and Kane in the alliance are Minnesota Wild defenseman Mathew Dumba  Detroit Red Wings defenseman Trevor Daley  Buffalo Sabres forward Wayne Simmonds  Chris Stewart  a forward in the American Hockey League  and Joel Ward  a retired N.H.L. winger. The creation of the Hockey Diversity Alliance comes during a cultural reckoning within the sport. None None None None None A major goal of the Hockey Diversity Alliance will be mentorship  giving younger players who are members of minority groups a chance to learn from the likes of Kane and Aliu. “We feel that we can be a great outlet for minority players all the way down to youth hockey coming up through the junior ranks and coming into pro with any issues they might be going through  whether that’s race-related or anything else ” Kane said. “I think having a group like us to lean on for experience  advice  thoughts or different ideas will empower them.” Aliu and Kane said they felt emboldened after talking to Kaepernick. “It’s enabled us to really feel even more strongly than we did originally about what we’re doing ” Kane said. “It was an invaluable call that we had with him.” Kaepernick declined to comment. “Our mission and goal is to make the game as diverse and inclusive as possible ” Aliu said. “It’s so that someone from any type of background  whether it’s economical  race  gender  gets to feel included in our game and feel like they’re wanted.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/sports/hockey/coronavirus-hockey-restart-plans.html,National Hockey League Edges Toward Restart With Detailed Plans Advertisement Supported by A modified playoff format  restricted practices and other considerations are being discussed between league executives and the players’ union. None A game once played outdoors in subzero temperatures and wool sweaters may soon crown its champion during the swelter of summer. On Monday  the National Hockey League sent a memo to players and members of the news media detailing a plan to resume its season with voluntary workouts as soon as early June after a layoff of more than two months. The announcement came after a vote last week in which the executive board of the N.H.L.’s players association approved a proposal for a 24-team playoff  scrapping the dozen or so games remaining in each team’s regular season. Discussions are continuing between the league and union on how  and where  to resume play  which would almost certainly occur without fans in the arenas. Even with the framework of the season’s finale taking shape  the plans underscored the concerns that hockey’s stakeholders are weighing to restart. The league’s 22-page “Phased Return to Sport Protocol” would allow for a maximum of six players at a time to meet in a team’s practice facility  along with a small group of team personnel. On-ice workouts cannot include coaches or trainers  and players will have to wear face coverings elsewhere inside team facilities. Players and team personnel will be required to undergo testing in advance of returning to practice facilities or  if the local supply does not allow for widespread testing  to quarantine for 14 days before they can enter. The league emphasized that these workouts would be voluntary — to allow for safety concerns and any immigration issues for players returning to the United States — and conducted only where local jurisdictions have relaxed restrictions to allow gatherings. “We are continuing to monitor developments in each of the club’s markets  and may adjust the overall timing if appropriate  following discussion with all relevant parties ” the memo said. The plan looks to be a starting point for vetting the logistics of the return to play. The competitive and financial stakes of the league’s return and the health risks associated with going back to normal  make any discussion complicated. The players’ union vote on the playoff format came after considerable debate but received near unanimous approval  with 29 of 31 team representatives voting to continue discussions. None The representatives for the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Carolina Hurricanes cast the only two votes against pursuing the proposal. “You look at teams that had a 10 percent chance to make it  now they’re pretty much on a 50-50 playing field ” Jordan Martinook  the Hurricanes representative  said in a conference call on Monday. Martinook said his team believed that the teams that were seeded fifth through eighth would face a disadvantage because they would have to play an additional five-game series under the new format. “When you have to win four to win the Stanley Cup — I’m sure the Blues would tell you that it’s hard enough — now that you’re going to have to win five it’s obviously harder ” he said. None Normally  a bye might be an advantage  allowing for more rest and preparation. But after not playing for two months  even top teams need as much time on the ice in high-stakes environments as possible  he said. And he is not comfortable with more teams in the playoff than would normally qualify. Still  he said  “there’s not going to be any way to do this that satisfies everyone. We’re just going to try to be as fair as possible. Whatever it is  we’re going to have to find a way to play with it.” As with other major professional leagues managing a return to play  getting Covid-19  the disease caused by the coronavirus  remains a big risk in many areas. Five players on the Ottawa Senators and three of the Colorado Avalanche’s players tested positive for Covid-19 in late March. The league said it consulted with Dr. Bruce Farber  an infectious disease specialist in New York  and other health professionals to shape guidelines that could include drastic changes to the game itself  ranging from mandating players wear full-face shields in games to prohibiting fights. Georges Laraque  a former enforcer who contracted and recovered from Covid-19  said that while he understood the financial motivation to return to play — estimates vary  but all place lost earnings from a canceled playoff north of $1 billion — he felt that the risks were too great to return this season. “This year  the guys are not playing for the Stanley Cup  they’re playing not to lose $1.5 billion next year ” Laraque said. “Whoever’s going to win the Cup this year  there’s going to be an asterisk marked on it. It’s a joke.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/sports/hockey/nhl-awards-ovechkin-pastrnak-draisaitl.html,N.H.L. Awards Offer Closure to Disrupted Season Advertisement Supported by The league doled out honors on Thursday as it prepared to begin an abnormal postseason. None The National Hockey League announced the recipients of four of its annual awards Thursday  two months after the regular season was abruptly halted  then canceled. Though there was little suspense since all four awards honor regular-season statistical leaders in various categories  the awards were a psychological marker that reified a bizarre timeline that has seen play suspended  players largely unable to train on ice and  most recently  steps taken toward a complex  expanded 24-team playoff that would be played over the summer. “I think it’s one of those moments where we realize that the regular season is over and it’s on to playoff mode ” Florida Panthers defenseman Keith Yandle said. Yandle acknowledged that some of the award races could have changed shape in the canceled portion of the season  but he emphasized that every player was dealing with the same unusual circumstances. The league had completed about 85 percent of the regular season when play was suspended on March 12. “It’s not like one or two teams got to play 10 games more. Pretty much everyone played the same amount of games and those guys were recognized for having amazing years ” Yandle said. Washington Capitals left wing Alex Ovechkin won his record ninth scoring title as he and Boston Bruins right wing David Pastrnak shared the Maurice “Rocket” Richard Trophy  awarded to the league’s top goal scorer. Both players scored 48 goals. Ovechkin was two goals shy of his ninth 50-goal season  which would have tied a record shared by Wayne Gretzky and Mike Bossy  with 13 games left on the Capitals’ schedule when the season was halted. Toronto Maple Leafs center Auston Matthews finished the truncated campaign one goal behind Ovechkin and Pastrnak. In addition to a potential tie-break  Matthews could have potentially fired his way to the trophy had the season been completed. Washington had played 69 games while Boston and Toronto had each played 70 when play was suspended. “I wouldn’t mind having a game against Boston or Toronto just so those three guys can decide ” Capitals center Evgeny Kuznetsov said. “Or  if they want to be creative  they could create a challenge for those three guys and have a competition between them to show their skills.” Edmonton Oilers forward Leon Draisaitl won the Art Ross Trophy as the league’s top point producer in the most comfortable fashion of any of Thursday’s winners. He finished 13 points ahead of his teammate Connor McDavid. Draisaitl  the first German player to win a scoring title in a major North American league  will undoubtedly receive consideration for the Hart Trophy  awarded to the N.H.L.’s most valuable player. A fan of his country’s soccer league  the Bundesliga  Draisaitl said he hoped the N.H.L. would glean lessons from that league’s restart earlier this month. “They’ve done a very professional job of making it as close as possible to a normal game day and a normal format ” he said. In a much closer race  the Bruins’ goalie tandem of Tuukka Rask and Jaroslav Halak won the William M. Jennings Trophy  awarded each season to the goalies for the team that allowed the fewest goals. They edged out the Dallas Stars’ Ben Bishop and Anton Khudobin by just seven goals allowed  and had played one more game than Dallas. The Bruins also earned the Presidents’ Trophy  awarded to the team with the highest point total. They had a game in hand and a 6-point advantage on the runner-up St. Louis Blues  their Stanley Cup finals adversary last year. None Only one player who was an award winner or runner-up Thursday  Khudobin  is headed toward potential free agency. None are on entry-level contracts and none face potential salary arbitration for next season. The player agents Allan Walsh and Eustace King agreed that any potential bonuses regarding trophies or their factoring into salary arbitration were matters that the N.H.L. and its players’ union would adjudicate in the near future because of the uncommon nature of this season and next. It was one of many issues to be resolved between the two sides in the near future. “All we have right now is an agreement on the format of a return to play  if we are able to get to the point where we are able to play games  that’s all we have ” Walsh said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/sports/hockey/nhl-playoffs-coronavirus.html,The N.H.L. Is Coming Back  Pending a Few (Dozen) Questions Advertisement Supported by Hockey’s tentative plan to resume this summer with a 24-team playoff hinges on resolving outstanding logistical  health  competitive and economic issues. None None There are many issues  some complicated  that need to be settled over the next several weeks to yield a 24-team  two-city hockey extravaganza that in its early stages would see up to three games played per day in a single arena  much like in the Olympics or the N.C.A.A. tournament. But the most important step the N.H.L. must confront to move forward is the same one that daunts the rest of the United States — figuring out how to execute a coronavirus testing protocol for players  staff and family members. None Under the league’s phased plan to restart  individual teams will be responsible for testing their players and staff members when voluntary workouts at the clubs’ home practice facilities begin  which could be as early as next month. Mandatory training camps are tentatively expected to start as soon as July 1  when teams would also handle testing. Once the teams report to one of two hub cities for playoff games — which could begin in late July or August — the N.H.L. will take over testing and its costs  which Bettman said will run into the millions of dollars. He also warned that the availability of tests will be a principal factor in choosing the two hub cities — one for each conference — from a list that includes Chicago  Columbus  Ohio  Dallas  Edmonton  Alberta  Las Vegas  Los Angeles  Minneapolis/St. Paul  Pittsburgh  Vancouver  and Toronto. “We need to make sure that there is enough testing available and we’ll be needing lots and lots of testing ” he said. “But we don’t want it to interfere with the medical needs of the community. That has to come first.” Players are likely to bring their families to the two hubs and  once inside  they would also need to undergo regimented testing. No plans have been made to allow guests or on who would assume the cost and administration of testing them. Bill Daly  the league’s deputy commissioner  said during the news conference that if one or two players test positive  it will not cause the entire project to shut down. But if a breakout occurs  it could cause a significant disruption. “Obviously we can’t be in a situation where we have an outbreak  and that will affect our ability to continue playing ” Daly said. “But a single positive test or isolated positive tests throughout a two-month tournament should not necessarily mean an end to the tournament.” None “It’s a reasonable expectation that there will be a higher number than normal ” Nichol said. “If you are careful you can reduce the chances of that happening. There is time for that  but there is not time to waste.” Fans are not likely to be allowed at games but there could be fake fans. Bettman indicated the television networks will experiment with ways to make the broadcasts seem normal. Selection of the hub cities is on hold as the N.H.L. tries to assess infection rates and travel restrictions with input from health officials and local government. Daly said that the league is in talks with Canadian government officials to ensure that teams would be able to freely cross borders  but Canada  which has three cities on the prospective hubs list  has a mandated 14-day quarantine for travelers arriving in the country. “We don’t have a resolution there ” Daly said  “but it’s an ongoing dialogue  for sure.” Beyond the discussions with its external stakeholders  the league must also resolve outstanding competitive and economic issues with its players for its plan to become a reality. The two-tier playoff format  where the top four teams in each conference play a mini round-robin tournament to determine seeding while the remaining 16 teams play best-of-five series  has drawn criticism. Some feel the number of playoff teams was expanded to 24 from 16 to include two more Canadian teams — the Montreal Canadiens and Winnipeg Jets — plus the big-market Chicago Blackhawks  Rangers and Islanders. But the decision to set the playoff standings according to points percentage excluded all of the N.H.L.’s California-based teams and the Detroit Red Wings  one of its most well-followed franchises  from postseason play. Seven teams had their seasons ended with Bettman’s announcement on Tuesday  with some  like the Buffalo Sabres and the Devils  having played fewer games than their competitors. Those teams can perhaps take solace in avoiding the headache of undertaking two months of preparation to play what could be only three games. “Who’s happier than the seven teams who aren’t in it?” said Steve Valiquette  the former Islanders and Rangers goalie who now serves as an analyst for the MSG Network. “Seriously  I went through this with the Islanders. We were out by a country mile and for those last two months it’s tough. I’m sure they are happy to get on with their summer program and get a fresh start for next year.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/sports/hockey/nhl-return-coronavirus.html,N.H.L. Announces Plan to Return Straight Into the Playoffs Advertisement Supported by Commissioner Gary Bettman and the N.H.L. Players’ Association agreed to terms on resuming the season with a 24-team playoff format that would yield a champion in early autumn. None More than two and a half months after shutting down because of the coronavirus outbreak  the National Hockey League became the largest North American professional sports league to announce definitive plans for a return. Gary Bettman  the commissioner of the N.H.L.  announced on Tuesday that 24 teams would return  if and when medically cleared  for a unique playoff tournament in two hub cities. Official training camps would resume no earlier than July 1  and the season would conclude with the presentation of the Stanley Cup to the 2019-2020 champion in the early autumn. The regular season was officially declared complete. “We remain focused on the safety of our players  coaches  support staff and arena personnel ” Bettman said. “We will not set dates  choose sites or begin to play until we know it is appropriate and prudent and are approved to do so.” None On Tuesday  Bettman outlined the next stages: the opening of training camps for all players  coaches and medical staff  and the start of a conference-based playoff. The hub cities  one hosting the Eastern Conference and one the Western Conference  will be chosen from a list that includes Chicago  Columbus  Ohio  Dallas  Edmonton  Alberta  Las Vegas  Los Angeles  Minneapolis/St. Paul  Pittsburgh  Vancouver  and Toronto. Bettman did not say whether fans would be allowed to attend the games  which would be broadcast on television. Bettman said that teams would be allowed to bring back 50 employees  including players  coaches  medical staff and club officials  all of whom will be tested for the coronavirus throughout the process. The players union  led by Donald Fehr  cautioned that though it had agreed with the league on the announced plans  there could be changes before play is resumed  including to health and safety protocols that were designed in conjunction with medical experts and the union. Some remaining financial matters will be addressed in talks between now and the beginning of the playoffs. “If they need to be amended over time  we will amend them ” Fehr said. “This is a living document  and we have to make sure that logistically  we can actually implement the steps.” When hockey resumes  the playoff will follow the format approved last week by the executive board of the N.H.L. Players’ Association  expanding the field to 24 teams from 16. The teams qualified based on their points percentages at the time the season was suspended. The top four teams in each conference will receive a first-round bye. They are the Boston Bruins  the Tampa Bay Lightning  the Washington Capitals and the Philadelphia Flyers in the East  and the St. Louis Blues  the Colorado Avalanche  the Vegas Golden Knights and the Dallas Stars in the West. During the first round  those teams will play a conference-based round robin — three games each — to determine their seedings  one through four. The remaining 16 teams will commence best-of-five series to determine which eight of them will advance to the second round. Bettman said that the league and the players union had not decided whether the second round would be best-of-five or best-of-seven and that the two factions were still discussing whether to reseed after the rounds or to maintain a bracket-style format. The conference finals and the Stanley Cup finals will be best-of-seven  as usual  and will most likely be played in the two hub cities. But Bettman said that if conditions change  the venues might  too. Seven teams — the Devils  the Buffalo Sabres  the Anaheim Ducks  the Los Angeles Kings  the San Jose Sharks  the Ottawa Senators and the Detroit Red Wings — did not qualify for the playoffs. Their seasons ended immediately  each with a dozen or so games unplayed  and they will be entered into the draft lottery along with the eight teams that lose in the first round. For teams like the Rangers  who would have been eliminated from the playoffs in the traditional  16-team format  the plan provides new life. As the East’s No. 11 seed  the Rangers will play the No. 6 Carolina Hurricanes in the first round. The No. 7 Islanders will play the No. 10 Florida Panthers.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/sports/hockey/akim-aliu-nhl-racism.html,Akim Aliu’s Account of Racism Pushes Hockey to Search Its Soul Advertisement Supported by After an article by the former N.H.L. player was published  various hockey players  fans and other stakeholders committed to reckoning with a culture they say cannot be fixed from the top down. None None In the article  Aliu discussed a high-profile hazing incident that took place when he was 16 and playing with the Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League. Aliu  31  said that after he refused to strip naked for a rookie hazing ritual  a teammate retaliated by attacking him with a hockey stick in their next practice  knocking out seven of his teeth. Aliu wrote that the player was Steve Downie  a top prospect who went on to play 434 games in the N.H.L. In the article  Aliu referred to Downie as a “racist sociopath.” Downie could not be reached for comment after multiple attempts by email and on social media to contact him through former teams and associates. “He was two years older than me and a rising star  and he wielded his power over me like I was nothing — like I was subhuman ” Aliu wrote. He added: “If you’ve heard of me  you’ve heard of the hazing incident that took place that season. Thanks to this guy  that was the way I was introduced to the entire hockey world. I was the kid who wouldn’t go along with it. The kid who didn’t ‘get’ the culture.” Aliu’s comments resurfaced an examination of the sport’s culture that became especially urgent in November when Aliu  who was born in Nigeria and reared in Ukraine and Canada  accused Coach Bill Peters  who is white  of referring to him with a racial slur when the two were with the American Hockey League’s Rockford IceHogs during the 2009-10 season. Peters  who by 2019 was coaching the Calgary Flames  resigned shortly after the accusations but has since been hired to coach a team in Russia’s Kontinental Hockey League. None But Aliu’s latest comments have ignited strong responses from the rest of the hockey community  as players  fans  and other stakeholders reckon with an issue they say cannot be resolved from the top down. None None None None None None None None Still  some caution against describing hockey culture as intrinsically problematic. None “Our job is to make the game better ” added Subban  an 11-year N.H.L. veteran who is black  “but it’s also our job to protect the people in the game that have done a great job trying to help these issues go away  and I think we can’t forget to talk about those people  as well.” Subban  who acknowledged that he had not yet read The Players’ Tribune article  commended Aliu’s outspokenness  but cautioned that the responsibility for change should not fall on any one group’s shoulders. “It’s not just the responsibility of the black players or players from different backgrounds in the league ” Subban said on the podcast. “It’s of everyone.” In a telephone interview on Thursday  Aliu said that the coronavirus pandemic had given him an opportunity to reflect on his journey through life and hockey. He said he had reached out to The Players’ Tribune three weeks earlier about describing his experience. “Because it’s told in my words  I wanted to get my full point across ” he said. “I wanted to make it as raw as possible. I wanted to make it as truthful and as meaningful as possible. “We’re going to need those star players to come out and back up the conversation. I definitely think hockey has a long way to go. This whole situation is proof of that  that a lot of players still feel silenced. Meaningful change is not going to start until players start coming out and voicing their support.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/sports/hockey/spanish-flu-1919-stanley-cup-finals.html,The Cost of Rushing Back to Sports: A Star’s Life Advertisement Supported by The 1919 Stanley Cup finals were more than a century ago  but they are bound to current reality by the struggle against a deadly virus and the push for sports to return. None Nobody made much of it when Joe Hall skated off the ice. On March 29  1919  his Montreal Canadiens were on the verge of losing Game 5 of the Stanley Cup finals to the Seattle Metropolitans. Hall  37  was one of hockey’s original enforcers  known for applying his wooden stick like a cudgel and delivering knockout blows. The Canadiens  behind by 3-0 heading into the third period  needed his pounding determination. But he went meekly to the bench and sat down. The Seattle crowd roared for the Metropolitans. The Canadiens mounted a comeback and won  4-3  in overtime. Hall was gone. Reporters failed to draw a connection between his departure — and the gaunt pallor of players on both teams — and the Spanish flu  which had swept across the world the year before. By the time the 1919 Stanley Cup finals had gotten underway  la grippe had become an afterthought. “People were exuberant  in need of something to celebrate ” said Kevin Ticen  a Seattle author who has written about the finals. “There was also a lot of denial.” Then the celebration turned somber. Days after Montreal’s comeback  players on both sides grew sick. More than half of the Canadiens  and the owner of the team  were stricken by the flu. Hall was suffering worst of all. The sports world  said his grandson Larry Hall  79  should learn from history. “What happened to my grandfather is relevant now in a way I never thought it would be ” he said. “The flu that hit the Stanley Cup came at the end of a series of pandemic waves. People relaxed  and then  unfortunately  it came again.” Hours before a winner-take-all Game 6  hockey officials did something they had never done before or since. They canceled the Stanley Cup finals midstream. Joe Hall lay in a hospital  gasping for breath. His temperature was spiking. He was fighting for his life. Even now  amid daily stories of death and the fight against Covid-19  it can be hard to fathom the pain of that time  101 years ago  when an aggressive pandemic and the devastation of World War I laid waste to the world. In the United States  the first deadly outbreak of the Spanish flu came in Kansas  hitting a small town and its Army base in early 1918. From there  it is thought  soldiers spread the flu across the country and into the trenches of Europe and then far beyond  fueling one of the worst disasters in human history. Over two years  the Spanish flu killed at least 50 million people  including 55 000 in Canada and 675 000 in the United States. More than half of its victims died during the second wave  which lasted three months late in 1918. A Jack Dempsey fight was postponed. Many high schools and colleges shortened or shuttered their sports seasons. Michigan and Pittsburgh were named the college football national champions. Both played only five games. None Ruth recovered and led the Sox to a World Series title in 1918. But teeming crowds at Fenway Park may well have spread the pandemic and helped make Boston one of the worst American epicenters of infection. No sport  however  was affected quite like hockey. Joe Hall was born in Britain and raised in rural Canada. He was one of professional hockey’s early stars and among its most notorious. A vagabond of sorts  Hall played for nine teams and played for two Stanley Cup winners before landing with the Canadiens in 1917 for one last stop. He wasn’t big — only about 165 pounds and 5 feet 9 inches. Though away from games he was well liked and known for his quiet dignity  on the ice he carried himself like a warrior. On one occasion  he was said to have attacked two Toronto players at the same time and caused a riot. Then there was a tale about an in-game skirmish during which he inflicted such bloody mayhem that he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. “They called him Bad Joe in those days  or sometimes just the Bad Man ” Larry Hall said. “A tough guy who refused to back down.” Hockey was different then  said Eric Zweig  a historian and the author of “Fever Season ” a book about Hall and the Cup. Players were not as big and strong as they are now  but they were tough and durable. Teams dressed only about 10 players. They did not wear masks or helmets and had little padding. Their pay? Larry Hall  a health club owner who spoke on the phone from his home two hours north of Toronto  described a cherished item on a wall in his office: Joe Hall’s contract for the 1918-19 season. He earned $600  with a potential $100 bonus. Blow-by-blow accounts of what happened during the 1919 Stanley Cup come from archived newspapers and a slim number of history books. There is no known audio or film record. Descendants of the Montreal and Seattle players tend not to know much. “My father never really spoke of it  at least not to me ” said Barbara Daniels  90  the daughter of Frank Foyston  Seattle’s best player. Maybe there was too much pain in the memories. Craig Patrick  a former N.H.L. player and coach who was an assistant for the “Miracle on Ice” team that won gold at the 1980 Winter Olympics  is the grandson of a league owner who figured prominently in the 1919 battle for the Cup. What little he knows about the championship series comes from what he has read. “In my family ” he said  “I don’t remember any stories being told about it at all.” But after all this time  Joe Hall’s family remembers. “The genes pass on ” Larry Hall said  “and for us  so do the stories. They’re part of who we are.” The 1919 Stanley Cup pitted the best team from the N.H.L. against the best team from the Pacific Coast Hockey Association  a plucky upstart with clubs in Washington  Oregon and western Canada. Its champions that year were the Metropolitans. They had beaten Montreal in 1917 to become the first American franchise to win the Cup. “They were absolutely huge in Seattle  true celebrities ” said Ticen  who has chronicled the team’s championship season in a book  “When It Mattered Most.” “They played sold-out games in a state-of-the-art arena for its day ” he said. “There are kids climbing the roof to watch from skylights. The games are electric  and everywhere the players go in the city people flock to them.” As the N.H.L. began its regular-season games in late 1918  some called the coming hockey year the Peace Season  a nod to the fact that World War I had ended a month earlier. But the Spanish Flu kept coming in waves. In Seattle  the death toll mounted that October  and the city clamped down. Wearing masks became mandatory  and spitting could result in arrest. Businesses  schools and churches were closed  and large gatherings were banned. When the number of sick people decreased  the measures were loosened — which led to the virus’s deadly return. By March  when Montreal arrived by train for the championship series  which would be played entirely in Seattle  the pandemic had retreated enough to become an afterthought. The fated fight for the Cup is known not only for how it ended  but also for its intensity. Game 4 is considered by many to be one of the greatest in hockey history. Seattle held a 2-1 series lead and needed just one more victory to take the Cup. But after two overtime periods  80 minutes of play and not a single goal from either side  the contest was called a tie. Exhausted players collapsed to the ice. Some needed to be carried to the locker rooms. “They may be playing for hockey championships for the next thousand years ” wrote a reporter on hand  “but they’ll never stage a greater struggle.” Then came Game 5 and Hall’s wilting departure. His illness was barely mentioned in initial reports. Hall  one newspaper said  simply had a high fever caused by “overexertion.” News stories about Hall’s condition reported his regressing each day as it became clear that he had been struck especially hard by the virus. His fever rose to alarm­ing levels — 102 degrees  103  104. Because of the double-overtime tie and Montreal’s Game 5 win  the teams were slated to play once more to decide the championship. The Spanish flu spread like fire through both teams  and the Canadiens didn’t have enough healthy players to keep going. After a proposal to bring in replacements was rejected  Montreal offered to forfeit. Seattle refused to claim the title that way. Finally  hockey officials decided to call the series a draw  a result memorialized on the Stanley Cup. The year and team names were etched on the silver chalice. Below that was engraved: SERIES NOT COMPLETED. And Joe Hall? His teammates recovered  but he remained hospitalized. Fluid filled his lungs  and his fever stayed stubbornly high. His wife raced by train from Canada to be at his side  but she was too late. A week after his last game  the great enforcer died. Advertisement ,articles/sports

Condemns Misogynistic Remarks by 2 Players on Social Media Advertisement Supported by The Washington Capitals forward Brendan Leipsic and the Florida Panthers prospect Jack Rodewald were part of a group chat that was apparently hacked. None The N.H.L. on Wednesday condemned misogynistic comments made by the Washington Capitals forward Brendan Leipsic and the Florida Panthers prospect Jack Rodewald in a group chat on social media. None “There is no place in our league for such statements  attitudes and behavior  no matter the form ” the N.H.L. said in a statement. “We will address this inexcusable conduct with the clubs and players involved.” Leipsic  who is in his fourth N.H.L. season  apologized on Wednesday for the comments and said in a statement that he recognized “how inappropriate and offensive these comments are.” The Capitals released a statement to several news media organizations saying that they would deal with the matter internally. An Instagram group chat where the messages were posted was hacked  Leipsic said  and images from the conversation were then posted on other social media accounts. He said he and the other participants believed the chat was private. “I am committed to learning from this and becoming a better person by taking time to determine how to move forward in an accountable  meaningful way ” Leipsic  25  said. “I am truly sorry.” Rodewald  who has 10 games of N.H.L. experience with the Ottawa Senators  played in the Panthers’ minor league system this season. None The team and the league were criticized for not anticipating trouble on the videoconference because its platform  Zoom  had repeatedly been the target of offensive hacks.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/sports/soccer/soccer-racism-broadcasting.html,‘Intelligent’ or ‘Strong’: Study Finds Bias in Soccer Broadcasts Advertisement Supported by An analysis sponsored by a union of English soccer professionals concluded that there was racial bias in the way European commentators talk about players. None None The protests have made it plain that the players do not believe soccer is immune to the kind of systemic inequalities that brought millions to the streets. On Monday  a study called into question yet another aspect of soccer that does not appear to be a level playing field. None Documenting an issue players have long bemoaned  the researchers found that broadcast commentators were not only far more likely to praise white players for their intelligence  leadership qualities and versatility  they were also substantially more likely to criticize black players for what they regarded as the absence of those attributes. None Those were not the only differences. White players  according to the study  were more likely to be credited with an admirable work ethic. Black players’ performances  even when stellar  were more likely to be attributed to a burst of good form. “Commentators help shape the perception we hold of each player  deepening any racial bias already held by the viewer ” said Jason Lee  the P.F.A.’s equalities education executive. “It’s important to consider how far-reaching those perceptions can be and how they impact footballers even once they finish their playing career. ”If a player has aspirations of becoming a coach or manager  is an unfair advantage given to players that commentators regularly refer to as intelligent and industrious  when those views appear to be a result of racial bias?” The P.F.A. study examined more than 2 000 remarks from commentators  concerning 643 players and spread across 80 games — in the top divisions of Italy  Spain  England and France — from the current season. None “Portraying African Americans as naturally athletic or endowed with God-given athleticism exacerbates the stereotype ” they wrote  “by creating the impression of a lazy athlete  one who does not have to work at his craft.” The P.F.A. study found that when analyzing in-game events — like the accuracy of a shot or a pass — commentators spread their praise and criticism evenly between white and nonwhite players: there was no bias  it concluded  when assessing factual events. Bias  though  seeped through when discussing the players in more general terms. As Rada and Wulfmeyer found  the “brain versus brawn” stereotype held  even when discussing elite soccer in 2020. White players were praised and black players criticized more frequently for their quality and ability to adapt to different roles  and black players were singled out for their physical strengths  rather than their mental ones. Players have noticed. Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling  among others  has spoken of the need to ensure greater representation of black players in managerial and executive positions. But they also are aware of how they are talked about during broadcasts. “It is never about my skill when I am compared to other strikers ” Lukaku said in an interview with The New York Times last year. “My one-on-one dribbling is good. I can do a step-over. I can beat a player. I remember one comment from a journalist that United should not sign Lukaku because he is not an ‘intelligent’ footballer.” None None “The P.F.A. is proud to support a diverse membership on the pitch ” the organization’s chief executive  Gordon Taylor said  “and we are determined to ensure this also translates to substantial BAME representation in all other areas of the game.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/sports/soccer/rory-smith-newsletter.html,Soccer Needs to Break This Link Advertisement Supported by Rory Smith On Soccer The far right has always seen soccer as fertile territory for new recruits. It is high time soccer made it plain its hatred is not welcome. None None A couple of Burnley players looked up at the sky. The drone of a single-engine plane circling low over the Etihad Stadium in Manchester had caught their attention  snapping their focus from the game against City in front of them. They squinted  trying to decipher the message trailing on the banner behind it. When they did so  they sighed  sadly  and shook their heads. Micah Richards was standing by the side of the field when he saw it. Richards  the former Manchester City defender  was on duty for television that night. He  too  had spotted the banner  but had only glanced at its wording. Only when a steward  a despairing look on his face  asked him to look again did he realize it did not  after all  say Black Lives Matter  as Richards had thought. White Lives Matter  the message read. White Lives Matter Burnley. None None A week or so earlier  as Britain emerged from lockdown into balmy June sunshine  London’s streets had roiled. After days and days of Black Lives Matter protests around the country  around the globe  after the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston was dragged into the sea in Bristol  after a statue of Queen Victoria in Leeds was daubed with graffiti  a “counterprotest” was planned. The quotation marks are relevant: In theory  people were marching to protect Britain’s beloved statues from those who had done them harm in the name of protesting against police brutality. In reality  they seemed to spend quite a lot of the time fighting  occasionally with each other  but mostly with the police. The message of their counterprotest was a little vague. The nature of it  though  was not. The iconography  the songbook  the pattern of the “protest” that day was familiar: It belonged to  and was borrowed from  soccer. As they marched through the streets  they chanted  “England ” as they would have done had the national team been playing. None None There is a comfort in that  for the rest of the country. They allowed them to believe these people were soccer’s problem  if only soccer did not exist  or if only it got its house in order  then they would all just go away. Such a reading  though  is unhelpful. Yes  a lot of the people there would consider themselves soccer fans. But from the look of it  a lot of them like potato chips  too  and sunburn and Nazism (they may not have understood that particular part of Churchill’s role in history). Whether they like soccer or not is not especially relevant. They are a problem that belongs to Britain that — whether the rest of us in the country like it or not — represents a section of the population. Blaming soccer for their existence is to shirk responsibility. But just as unhelpful is the other trope that emerged after the White Lives Matter plane flew over the Etihad. There is a tendency to suggest that people with such abhorrent views are not real soccer fans  that they are merely using soccer for their own ends  to sow their hatred and division. That  too  is passing the buck. It is soccer saying they are someone else’s problem. None Nor is it just an English problem. Ultra groups across Europe — with only occasional exceptions — skew to the right  even if the roots of the movement lie in the revolutionary leftism of the 1960s. In England  the bond is not quite that explicit now  though the lyrics regularly heard during England’s fleeting visits to tournaments — as well as a slew of racist incidents in recent years — make it clear this is not a battle that has been won. Whether soccer wants them or not  whether soccer takes responsibility for them or not  much of the far right still regards the game as its natural home. It is not enough for soccer’s authorities to divest themselves of responsibility for these incidents. It is not enough for fans to make clear that these people do not speak for them. There must  as the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear  be active opposition. It is not enough not to stand with  we must stand against. That means not finding a frisson of excitement in the outlaw identity of ultras proudly bathing in the iconography of fascism. It means not fetishizing the days of hooliganism and casuals and firms  glibly writing their politics out of their violence. It means understanding that they do not believe they speak for the club  but that they speak for the fans. It means passing down through time stories of the damage they did  not the example they set. The strange thing about the plane at the Etihad is that the stadium  that night  was empty. There were no fans to see it. The message got out only because the news media noticed it  reported it  spread it around. The organizers of the stunt knew that would happen. They knew it would reach the people they wanted it to reach  somehow  because soccer is their game  the game that has always made them feel welcome  treated them as renegades and troublemakers  rather than racists and fascists. Enough  now. It is time to make it clear that it is not their game  and it never was. These are red-letter days for Liverpool. On Wednesday night  Jürgen Klopp’s team dismantled Crystal Palace — producing a display of quite remarkable frenzy and firepower made all the more striking by its sterile backdrop — to move to within two points of a first Premier League title in 30 years. On Thursday  Chelsea beat Manchester City to deliver it. None None That charge is basically correct  but Liverpool’s explanation is worth examining. Liverpool  essentially  wants its women’s team to be sustainable. It does not want it to be reliant on regular cash infusions from the men’s game. Personally  that strikes me as myopic. Twenty years ago  English men’s teams happily paid over the market rate for foreign stars because they recognized they would make the league more glamorous in the long term. Women’s soccer  in Europe  is at that stage now. Owners are speculating to accumulate. But long term  it is worth asking if Liverpool has a point. It is not healthy for the women’s game to be financed by the men’s  to be reliant on the men’s for its income  to be vulnerable to the shifting priorities of men’s clubs  as happened at Liverpool. The future for women’s soccer is not in being an offshoot of men’s soccer. It does have to be self-sustaining. It is in the interests of everyone to work out how that can happen. Impossible as it would have seemed even two months ago  this weekend the Bundesliga will become the first of Europe’s major leagues to finish its season on the field. It is not  admittedly  quite the dramatic final day we might have hoped for — Bayern  being Bayern  does not allow such things to happen — but there is no shortage of intrigue. None None None None None As Brion observes: “We do not look at sunsets for the spectacular but for their intrinsic beauty. Each one we see can fill us with a sense of the glory that exists in the world. Sure  occasionally there may be spectacular thunderstorms in another part of the sky  the elusive green flash  or a flock of birds perfectly silhouetted  but we return for the mundane.” Brion’s particular sunset is the N.W.S.L. and the United States’ national team — the good one  not the bad one — which  by allowing him to watch “remarkable athletes think and work through a game ” offers a “couple hours of peace.” None None Deep down  Graham knows the answer. We all do. How would they sell their away jerseys if they never wore them? Soccer is  in part  essentially a product placement exercise. None Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/sports/soccer/nwsl-ppp-loan.html,Federal Loan Saved a Soccer Season Nearly Lost to the Pandemic Advertisement Supported by The N.W.S.L. was one of millions of businesses that took Paycheck Protection Program loans this year. The money got the league and its players through eight uncertain weeks. None None The recipients ranged from clothing stores to car dealerships to coffee shops. They also included a women’s professional soccer league. The National Women’s Soccer League confirmed Thursday afternoon that it had received an unspecified amount from the program  and had used the money as a bridge to pay players for two months. It expects the loan to be forgiven. None But the N.W.S.L. desperately needed the money as it sought to salvage its eighth season — not to mention several hundred jobs. One hundred percent of the funds were used to pay player salaries for more than two months  the league said. “Our sole intent in applying for the P.P.P. loan was to continue player compensation ” said Lisa Baird  the league’s first-year commissioner. “With ours  the calculus was pretty simple. Either you’re going to pay your players or you’re going to furlough them. What could we do?” The decision to apply for the loan came amid Baird’s tumultuous start as commissioner. She officially took over the position on March 10. Two days later  she shut down the league in response to the pandemic. She called this period “the fog.” The league  like every other business  was scrambling. “Nobody knew what was going on ” she said. Baird said the N.W.S.L.  as a small operation with a brief history and only a few hundred employees  was almost entirely reliant on stadium ticket sales and local sponsorships for revenue. Those disappeared when this spring’s games were called off. When Baird took the job  the league had only two national sponsors. After consulting with league officials and owners  Baird said she gathered a thousand backup documents — “literally a thousand” — and sat at her computer for six hours to personally submit the application. “Over 85 percent of our total monthly expenses is player compensation ” she said of the league’s finances. “I didn’t even want to stare at the alternatives. For me  I had to have this happen.” In important ways  the N.W.S.L. fulfilled the strict qualifications set out by the federal government relief program: A relatively young business  it had fewer than 500 employees  the pandemic had effectively barred its employees from working  and its workers’ incomes  and perhaps careers  could have disappeared altogether if the league had been unable to play matches. Baird  who has only 16 people on staff to go along with more than 200 players  described the P.P.P. funding as the bridge that allowed them to escape the early danger of the pandemic. (The league’s top players and biggest earners — more than two dozen members of the women’s national team — are paid by U.S. Soccer.) None None None “That benefit outweighed anything that we could think of in terms of optics ” Baird said. Baird said she expected the league’s P.P.P. loan would qualify for forgiveness because 100 percent of the money was used for payroll (the government requires that at least 60 percent of the funds be used for payroll for a loan to be forgiven) and because the N.W.S.L. did not lay off any employees  another condition. “I pray for that in my nightly prayers ” said Baird  who said she and some other highly compensated league officials had taken pay cuts in a separate attempt at belt-tightening. Having used the loan as a lifeboat  Baird on Thursday cautiously deemed the summer and the nascent tournament a success. An entire team  the Orlando Pride  dropped out before play even began after six players and four staff members tested positive for the virus. But the first game — in which players made headlines for kneeling during the national anthem — drew the highest television rating in the league’s history. “It gives us confidence that we can be a small business that can make it through this time ” Baird said. “That’s a key thing: We’re not a large business. We’re a small business.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/sports/soccer/serie-a-president.html,Italian Soccer’s Fractious Chorus Tries a New Tune: Cooperation Advertisement Supported by On Soccer Serie A’s president  Paolo Dal Pino  walked into a crisis when he took the job in January. Six months later  he sees the pandemic as an opportunity to remake his league. None Pretty quickly  Paolo Dal Pino realized that the illustrious list of names on his glittering résumé  the long years spent in the boardrooms of some of Italy’s corporate behemoths  the experience that had gotten him the job — none of it was fitting preparation for running his country’s top soccer league. Serie A  after all  did not function like his former employers  the industrial giant Pirelli or the telecom provider Wind  or the communications company Telit  where he remains chief executive  even after he agreed to take charge of Italy’s top division in January. The league did not have a defined hierarchy or a sense of purpose. What it had  instead  was 20 presidents of 20 teams  bickering among themselves. It was a schoolyard and a debating chamber  fraught by internal politics and vulnerable to internecine strife. One faction  including many of the league’s makeweights  gathered around Claudio Lotito  president of Lazio. Others clustered around Juventus  its powerhouse. The growing number of American owners — at Roma and A.C. Milan and Fiorentina — had a different set of ideas again. The chances of the league’s conjuring a unified response to the coronavirus crisis  then — picking a way through the enforced hiatus  finding a route back to the field  one that satisfied all of the competing agendas — should have been remote. It might have been expected to break the league for good. Instead  Dal Pino feels the pandemic might have healed it. “There is more unity than before ” he said. His explanation is  for the president of a soccer competition  a slightly unexpected one: Serie A could work together precisely because there were no games. The absence of action on the field  Dal Pino said  “cleared the table of many issues.” Without the squabbles that would invariably break out after a weekend’s games — fingers pointed at referees  opponents smeared  rivals scorned  all of it played out in Italy’s ravenous sports media — Serie A’s executives could  at last  find harmony. “Not having games  not having discussions where they were criticizing the referees or the players  not having the controversies  removed a lot of tension ” he said. “Covid-19 changed a lot of things. It changed the way people interacted.” Andrea Agnelli  the Juventus president  gives at least some of the credit for that to Dal Pino himself: His “diplomacy ” Agnelli said  helped to keep the clubs on board. The test for Dal Pino is ensuring that sense of togetherness — fostered in the panic of the shutdown — can hold now that Serie A  like most of Europe’s major leagues  has returned to the field. The pandemic was an existential threat  it is far from the only challenge the league has to face. Dal Pino arrived in his role in January  the fourth man to take up the post of Serie A president in four years. If  from the outside  the job has the air of a sinecure — just someone to hand out the medals at the end of the season  to smile and to shake hands — and an uncertain  short-lived one at that  he wanted to interpret it slightly differently. In his first official communiqué after taking the role  he urged the owners of the league’s clubs to “come together” to restore Serie A to the position it held in the 1990s  as “the most beautiful league in the world.” None None The issue had become so endemic that a number of black players had refused moves to Italy because they feared being racially abused. After Romelu Lukaku  the Inter Milan striker  was abused at a game  a former teammate of his at Chelsea  Demba Ba  urged black players to leave Serie A. None None But Serie A still seemed a long way from what it once was. The pandemic had dealt a crippling blow  “devastating the industry ” as Dal Pino put it  not just in terms of ticket sales but “all activities related to games  like merchandising and sponsorships.” “Abandoning the season would have severely impacted the value of both the clubs and the players ” he said. That has been staved off — for now — of course. Dal Pino is even hopeful that some fans may start to return to Italian stadiums as soon as July. “We need to be prudent and patient  but we are confident that if the health situation continues to improve  the gradual return of fans into the stadiums will be a reality  perhaps partially next month ” he said. His vision  though  does not stop at a return to normal  not as it was before. His plan  instead  focuses on change. “Any crisis situation represents an opportunity to improve ourselves by all means ” Dal Pino said. “There are opportunities to be seized.” None None If any of it is to come to fruition  though  if Dal Pino is to see his vision for Italian soccer grow into something more real  he will need the presidents of his 20 teams — the clutter of cats that it is his job to herd — to remember that they can work together  to keep hold of the harmony they could find in silence  even now that the noise has started again.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/sports/soccer/lyon-aulas-ligue-1.html,French Soccer’s Renegade President Would Like a Word. With Everyone. Advertisement Supported by As French soccer closed down  one club executive complained the loudest. Now  as other European soccer leagues have resumed  Jean-Michel Aulas is doubling down. None Jean-Michel Aulas has been watching a lot of soccer in recent weeks. His emotions have been mixed. On the one hand  Aulas  the president of the French club Olympique Lyonnais  loves the sport. And even though games across Europe are being played against the surreal and sterile backdrop of fan-free stadiums  he says he cannot get enough of it. On the other hand  with each passing game  with each passing week that soccer’s return from its monthslong pandemic pause passes without incident  Aulas’s fury has mounted. For weeks  Aulas  71  had been the loudest voice — and at times the only voice — pressing for the French league to stay the course  to not be so hasty in declaring its season over while other leagues across Europe were still plotting ways to resume their schedules. None “It’s a massive frustration for us because football started everywhere ” Aulas said in a telephone interview earlier this week. None Aulas’s critics accuse him of being a blowhard  a man whose fury is borne entirely out of self interest. His team  a regular Champions League competitor  one that had played in Europe for 23 consecutive years  will be perhaps the hardest hit by Ligue 1’s decision to end the season. When the season stopped  Lyon was in seventh place  outside of the European places for next season. “You have to understand he is really hurt  really injured  and he worries about the financial situation  but he is trying to change reality ” said Bernard Caiazzo  the president of another club  Saint-Étienne  and the head of a group that represents Ligue 1 clubs. Aulas’s fiery remarks have created damaging fissures with other leading figures in French soccer  including Caiazzo and Didier Quillot  the chief executive of Ligue 1  which is known as L.F.P. Quillot declined to discuss Aulas. “L.F.P. management has decided to work instead of speaking ” he said in an email provided by a league spokesman. Caiazzo  who sits on the board of the Ligue 1  suggested Aulas was trying to rewrite history. The comments by Philippe  the prime minister  in Parliament on April 28  in which he declared the season over  had set off a chain reaction  Caiazzo said. Within hours  the president of France’s soccer federation declared amateur and professional soccer over  and the top division’s main television partner announced it would cancel the remainder of its contract. Then came the league’s board meeting. “At this time there were 1 000 deaths per day ” Caiazzo said. “Do you think somebody will put their hand up and say  “Sorry  I don’t think we will stop.’ We would have been outlaws.” The league  in Aulas’s view  panicked. He said he was actually defending France’s interests when he argued against ending the season  the league  he said  now risks punishment by European soccer’s governing body for not trying to finish its campaign. And events in the weeks and months that have followed do appear to support at least some of Aulas’s claims. France’s sports minister  Roxana Maracineanu  surprised many recently when she suggested it was ultimately the league’s call to end the season  and UEFA’s president  Aleksander Ceferin  has described the decision as “premature.” The easing of restrictions in France  where shops and restaurants have gradually started to reopen  along with the resumption of play in Europe’s other top leagues  have made French soccer’s decision the exception rather than the rule. “I publicly said that this is a mistake  and a big misunderstanding of the real situation  so I was alone to express myself  yes ” Aulas said. “Often in France people who speak out are right  but are often only seen to be right after it is too late.” None Set against that bleak backdrop  clubs in France are certain to see their values tumble  and for bargain hunters hoping to take advantage of the grim financial situation  to start to circle. Aulas expects prices  both for clubs and for the players that are their most valuable assets  to plummet. “I think the way things have been managed has really destroyed French football ” he said. Under Aulas  president of the team for more than three decades  Lyon emerged from a relatively modest past to become the main force in French soccer during the first decade of the century  winning all seven of its league titles and serving as France’s flag-carrier in the Champions League. It has since been surpassed by Paris Saint-Germain  the perennial league winner backed by Qatar. Aulas said P.S.G.’s president  Nasser al-Khelaifi  had provided quiet support to his ultimately doomed attempts to keep the season going. The teams will meet in the delayed French League Cup final next month  and both remain in the Champions League  which will conclude in August in Portugal. Should Lyon get past Juventus  which it leads by 1-0 after the first game of their two-legged  round-of-16 playoff  it will join P.S.G. in Lisbon. By the time those games happen  most players on French teams will not have played competitive soccer since early March. (P.S.G. will also contest the French Cup final  France’s top knockout event  against Saint-Étienne  in July). In Aulas’s mind  as the virus raged in April  France’s government alighted on the soccer industry to make a point  to demonstrate it was acting decisively to tackle a virus that had been devastating the country. In short  he said  the decision to end the season was a piece of theater. “They have used football as a political tool in the middle of this public health crisis of coronavirus  and I have to admit this is a shame for football people ” he said. For now  Aulas can do little except continue to watch soccer on television  and continue to fume. The club’s legal battles will go on  he said. And Aulas is sure to keep insisting that he was right.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/sports/soccer/premier-league-tottenham-manchester-united.html,Empty Stands  Mind Tricks and a Mourinho Myth Advertisement Supported by Rory Smith On Soccer The Premier League has been missing for three months. It was never going to live up to expectations. None None Soccer journalism’s hottest ticket  for a long time  was a José Mourinho news conference. Whichever team he was coaching  however well it was performing  Mourinho was a sure thing: Before a game  after a game  regular as clockwork  he would deliver 30 minutes or so of one-liners and aphorisms and mind games and clapbacks. Mourinho was box office. It was that ability to entertain — as much as that imperious run of success of his  stretching from the early 2000s deep into the 2010s — that made Mourinho such a natural fit for the Premier League  a place that has always been more an entertainment complex than a sporting competition  a soap opera that just so happens to be set in the world of soccer. It is England  after all  that has always revered managers more as characters than as thinkers: Its pantheon is stocked by the sharp-tongued and the quick-witted  the likes of Bill Shankly and Brian Clough and Alex Ferguson  more than it is by the contemplative and the coolheaded. None To listen to the stories  to flick through his back catalog was a reminder that a Mourinho news conference was must-watch television. And to some extent  of course  that was all true. Mourinho  sometimes  was a compelling orator. Occasionally  he would say something hilarious  or outrageous  or venomous. None The reason for the discrepancy between his reputation and reality  of course  is what anyone who has read even a bit of the psychologist Daniel Kahneman identified as the availability heuristic: We recall unusual events much more easily than the mundane  we remember exceptions  rather than rules  we think  in other words  in highlights. None It was  all in all  a fairly typical evening of Premier League soccer: a major talking point  a familiar scapegoat  and two games probably best enjoyed by aficionados of the four clubs involved (well  maybe not Arsenal). None All of which led the watching public deep into what might  in this context  be better described as the Highlights Fallacy  rather than the availability heuristic. Did the games seem a reduced version of themselves because of the altered surroundings? Had the absence of fans had a direct impact on the quality of entertainment on the field? Or was this something else? For three months  we have nursed our nostalgia for soccer. We have  as a soccer-watching public  yearned for its return  ideally in its usual form  but if not  then in some recognizable shape. We have watched reruns of classic games and YouTube highlights and Facebook packages of goals from seasons past. And  naturally  when we think of soccer  we think of the exceptions. We think of Tottenham coming from behind  at the last moment  to beat Ajax  or Liverpool roaring back to overcome Barcelona  or Manchester United snatching victory from Bayern Munich in the last minute. As with Mourinho  we remember highlights. But what makes those games so memorable is that they are rare  if every game was like that  those examples would not flood so readily to mind. Instead  the vast majority of games are like Wednesday’s Premier League offerings: disjointed and routine and  at times  though we are careful not to admit it  quite dull. They are of interest  really  only to those who are emotionally invested in them. Given the absence of soccer over the last few months  though  the audience for both games was much higher than it might have been. Sheffield United’s visit to Aston Villa  for example  might not even have been on television in normal circumstances. Fans were watching for a taste of this new world  happy just to savor the sight of soccer — in whatever form — once more. When they — as some did — found themselves drifting away from the screen  the assumption was that it was the change in the surroundings that had done it  without fans  the sport itself seemed meaningless. Perhaps  for some  that will prove to be true in time: There is no question that soccer is improved by the presence of fans (and nobody  at all  has ever argued the opposite). But perhaps  too  it was a trick of the mind  a trick of the light. It is not soccer as we remember it not because it is not soccer  but because we remember it wrong. We remember the highlights  the moments that take the breath away  rather than the often humdrum reality of life as a sports fan. Over the last few months  as soccer faded from view  perhaps we allowed our expectations to rise too high. We forgot that we do not  without fail  find ourselves glued to a game in which we have no tribal interest  whether the stadium is packed or not. We forgot that we watch more games that fail to spark than we see fireworks. We forgot that not everything  with Mourinho  is a zinger  that not every game  in soccer  is a highlight reel  and that what keeps drawing us back is not the guarantee a game will take our breath away  but the possibility of it. We forgot that the parts we remember are only a small fraction of what soccer is. They stand out because they are rare  and that  in a sense  is what makes them special. Unusually for Bayern Munich  the championship came the hard way. Both during the game on Tuesday night which sealed the title — a gritty 1-0 win against relegation-threatened Werder Bremen  made all the more complicated by a red card for Alphonso Davies — and over the course of the season as a whole. When Bayern lost by 5-1 to Eintracht Frankfurt back in November  it seemed its seven-year grip on the Bundesliga trophy was starting to loosen. The squad seemed in dire need of rejuvenation  caught in that no-man’s-land between generations. Nico Kovac was fired as coach. RB Leipzig  Borussia Mönchengladbach and Borussia Dortmund seemed well-placed to take a shot at the crown. How it ended is how it always ends in Germany: with Bayern capturing yet another title. That is eight in a row now  and that is cause more for concern than celebration. But  in the circumstances  it should possibly be set aside for a moment  because Bayern’s victory is  to an extent  a victory for German soccer as a whole. In May  the Bundesliga took a risk in becoming the first major league  in any sport  to return from its coronavirus lockdown. It was a month or so ahead of all of its rivals in Europe  and a couple or more ahead of the major leagues of North America. And yet  there are now only two games left in the German season. It has crowned a champion  fair and square  on the field. It is within sight of the finish line  and it has got there smoothly  calmly  and with a minimum of fuss. None In the two months or so since Matt Hancock  Britain’s health secretary  declared that it was time for the Premier League’s footballers to “play their part” and — for reasons that were never made entirely clear  and were never applied to musicians or actors or any other high-earning individuals — help pay for the National Health Service  those same footballers have: joined together to create a fund  #PlayersTogether  to contribute directly to Britain’s health service as it copes with the coronavirus crisis  persuaded the Premier League  an organization so apolitical it can only be read as a political choice  not only to adorn jerseys with a Black Lives Matter badge  but to replace players’ names with the phrase Black Lives Matter  informed the Premier League they would be taking a knee immediately after kickoff at each match to show their support for the movement  None All of it is a reminder that  whenever athletes are told to stick to sports  it is generally because they might use their power and their platform to achieve things either beyond politicians or anathema to someone else’s ideologies. It is a lesson of the pandemic that athletes may not forget. The feast  then  has started. There is basically soccer on television constantly  now  until the end of July. It’s a welcome return  of course  but somehow a daunting prospect  too. When there is so much to take in  how do you know where to start? Well: two games stand out from the first full slate of Premier League games: Friday’s meeting between Tottenham and Manchester United — José Mourinho up against his former club  currently in possession of what he covets above all else  a theoretical Champions League place — and Sunday’s Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. Liverpool cannot claim its first title in 30 years on Everton turf — Manchester City’s impressive win against Arsenal on Wednesday ensured that — but the game does  at least  bring up a fascinating philosophical quandary. A core of Everton fans has spent the last three months insisting that none of this soccer means anything. Their reasons for that are not hard to fathom  but it complicates how they might react to beating the champion-elect. Would that not be a legitimate result  either? The timing works out so that  by the time Everton has sorted out how much a win means  you can switch over to Real Sociedad against Real Madrid. The Spanish title race — Madrid can move to 2 points behind first-place Barcelona with a win — is much more interesting than the English (or the German)  anyway. Before all that  RB Leipzig faces Borussia Dortmund in a sort of unofficial second-place playoff in the Bundesliga on Saturday afternoon. A win for Leipzig would guarantee its place in the Champions League next season. Those four games should just about sate your appetite. None None None “Large numbers of U.S. fans instantly know the difference between that and any [major] European league ” he wrote. Like most  he agrees M.L.S. has improved  but because it falls short of the world’s most high-profile leagues  perhaps fans find it less appealing. “At some point  the league became watchable: not the Bundesliga  Premier League or Serie A  but interesting enough to compel the attention of most soccer fans.” None Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/sports/soccer/ryan-rabel-rory-smith.html,A Career Spent on Twitter Can’t Ever Tell the Whole Story Advertisement Supported by Rory Smith On Soccer Ryan Babel  one of the first high-profile soccer players to use social media  has spent his career being defined by everything but his play. None None None Babel had read it. The idea that the advent of social media was the most significant shift in soccer’s culture over the last decade resonated with him. Kindly  he said he had enjoyed it — enough  in fact  to share it on his Twitter feed. This was the awkwardness. That is something I should have known  something I would have liked to have known. But it was something I did not know  because Ryan Babel blocked me on Twitter years ago. As we were arranging a time to meet on Zoom  I had gone back and forth on whether to bring this up with him. Part of me wondered if it might be quite a funny way to start an interview. Part of me was convinced it would be disastrous. None When the time came  I reminded him that I wouldn’t know what he shares on social media — he might be retweeting a lot of my work  for all I know — because of the  er  situation. “Yeah ” he said  with a grin. “Someone told me about that.” He did not seem angry about it. He looked quite comfortable on his sofa. So I asked: Does he remember why? No  he said  but he remembers he was “quite sensitive to criticism at the time.” He was still getting used to Twitter as a medium back then. He had grown up on MySpace and Facebook  but Twitter was different. He was one of the first players to adopt it  but he saw quickly that it had a “different dynamic.” “The others were still quite private  so you could express yourself more ” he added. “Then you come to a platform where you are exposed to the press. It was totally new.” In those early days  he said  he made “mistakes.” There are things — he does not specifically cite it  but let’s assume one of them was mocking up a referee in a Manchester United jersey and getting fined $12 500 — that he would do differently if he could go back in time  or if there had been someone around  as there would be now  to advise him on his social media strategy. What is striking  talking to Babel (once we have smoothly sidestepped the awkwardness)  is to what extent those early mistakes came to define him in the eyes of the soccer public  and quite how stubbornly we hold on to our initial impressions of a player as a person  quite how steadfastly we deny that player the right to change or the chance to grow. It was not just social media. During his time at Liverpool  Babel was criticized  too  for his fledgling music career  he had been a talented enough keyboardist to play in a band at festivals in his native Amsterdam. From a young age  he had been made to treat soccer as “business ” so he had come to find his pleasure in music. The idea that he was too busy collaborating with rappers and tweeting to dedicate himself to his craft was never true  not in any real sense — most people are afforded the right to have a job and an outside interest — but it stuck. It was bestowed with explanatory power: Babel’s form wavered not because he was in a Liverpool team that was in constant upheaval  but because he was distracted. To be an athlete  Babel said  is to “have your life lived by other people.” After a while  theories promulgated on the outside have a habit of seeping into soccer. It was determined that Babel was not making the most of his talent  that he was drifting. Bert van Marwijk  the Dutch national team coach  told him he had to play every week to be selected. He became “desperate” to move  and ended up leaving Liverpool for Hoffenheim in Germany. “It was not a decision I made with my heart ” he said  but to stave off external pressure. He did play at Hoffenheim  every week. Van Marwijk dropped him anyway. Babel moved on again  back to Ajax  and then to the Turkish club Kasimpasa. “I had a lot of setbacks in those years ” he said. When he moved to the United Arab Emirates in 2015  to join Al Ain  it seemed to confirm the idea that he was destined never to fulfill his potential. “It was a typical end-of-career move ” Babel said. He relished the chance to “experience another culture ” but he is honest enough to admit that his rationale was largely financial. If soccer treated him as an asset  then he would treat it as a business. “I decided I would make decisions that made me happy ” he said. And that  for much of soccer  is where the Ryan Babel story ended. Even he knows that moving to the Gulf can look more like a player’s seeking a final payday in the sunshine. In the eyes of many  Babel was finished. When he left Al Ain  in 2016  he could not find a new club. “I had been somewhere that people did not consider real football territory ” he said. “I had a lot of anxiety that it was the end for me.” He was reduced to training with Ajax’s second team. He had been a Dutch international only a few years before. He was 29  what should have been his peak  but in soccer’s eyes  he was finished  an empty promise  a forever lost boy. Four years later  Babel is still playing. Deportivo La Coruña rescued him from free agency  and within a few weeks of thinking his career was over  he was facing Messi and Ronaldo. Besiktas  in Turkey  picked him up from there  giving him another shot at the Champions League. He has had spells at Fulham and at Galatasaray and now a loan back to Ajax. Last year  he even regained his place in the Netherlands squad. He now has 63 international caps. He is in the full flush of an Indian summer. A player deemed a failure at 27 is still going at 33. Whether he has failed to hit the heights he might have is impossible to say  but his career  by almost any metric  has been a long and successful one. Those early mistakes seem distant now  not  perhaps  because the way we see Babel has changed — soccer  after all  does not permit characters to grow — but because the way we see soccer has. Where once Babel’s extracurricular interests were seen as a distraction  now we almost expect soccer players to have another life — a clothing line or a charity initiative or a tennis tournament. Over the years  Babel has doubled down  diversified. He has a record label — “music is a little bit business now  too” — and a property portfolio and a suite of investments in start-ups. He reads Robert Kiyosaki and tries to pass on investment advice to younger players. It is not the work of a young man unable to focus. His use of social media has changed  too. Once  it seemed almost unprofessional for a player to be on Twitter. A decade on  every player is there. An entire generation lives its life on Instagram  and Babel has the air of a pioneer. Ryan Babel did not change to fit in with soccer  the rest of soccer changed to fit in with him. Well  at least that is what I assume happened. It is hard to tell. I’m still blocked. There is something in the way Riqui Puig moves that is immediately familiar: how he makes short  sharp bursts into two or three yards of space  how he stretches out his palms to demand the ball  how he turns his head  right and left  left and right  glancing constantly over his shoulder like a spy trying to shake a tail. Puig carries with him the imprimatur of Barcelona. It is too early to say what sort of career he will have — he is only 20  and he has played only a handful of times in La Liga — but he plays in the same way  with the same mannerisms  as his immediate predecessors: Xavi Hernández and Andres Iniesta. He may or may not ever match their successes  but he has had the same education as the greats. This is what Barcelona was supposed to become  of course: a tireless production line  churning out imaginative  impish soccer players one after the other  the principles of Johan Cruyff and the ideas of Pep Guardiola passed down from one generation to the next  an empire without end. None Watching Puig against Atlético Madrid this week  though  illustrated not just to what extent Barcelona has lost its way  squandered its legacy  but the shame of it. Puig was everything a young Barcelona player should be: smart and adventurous and brave  a hopeful in a team of superstars who kept demanding the ball long after everyone else had lost heart. But around him is a team that is timeworn and faded. A club in chaos. Barcelona was the best team  and the best club  in the world  once. It was perfect: a model that could last forever. And yet here it is  five years from its last Champions League title  needing to start all over again. None Cazorla is well into the second season of his comeback after losing almost two years to injury. Just how good a player he has been is best illustrated  perhaps  by the fact that he not only made it back onto the field  but back into Spain’s national team last year. None That attempt continues on Sunday  when Villarreal hosts Barcelona. Earlier in the day  Real Madrid will face Athletic Bilbao  knowing that with the right combination of results  the Spanish title race may well be all but finished. On Saturday  Bayern Munich can claim its second trophy of the season — with the Champions League still to come — in the German cup final: a slick Bayer Leverkusen team lies in wait in Berlin  hardly a pushover. As an appetizer for that  the most compelling Premier League game of the weekend sees Wolves host Arsenal. One of the two has a genuine chance of qualifying for the Champions League. It is not Arsenal. None None The way we talk about players is  I think  significant: By reducing Black players  in particular  to their athletic abilities  we are allowing our biases and prejudices to diminish their career prospects. These are all small steps  of course  but they are small steps in the right direction. It suggests that the players’ determination to support Black Lives Matter is being heard.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/sports/soccer/fiorentina-transfers-rocco-commisso.html,Secret Contracts Held a Surprise for Fiorentina’s New Owners Advertisement Supported by Rocco B. Commisso completed his purchase of an Italian team in record time. It was only after the closing that he learned an agent controlled the fate of some of the club’s top players. None When Rocco B. Commisso completed his purchase of the Italian soccer club A.C.F. Fiorentina last summer  he described the deal as the “quickest closing in soccer history.” None But like other American owners who have invested in Italian soccer  Commisso  70  has quickly learned that the challenge of running a team in Italy is a far more difficult undertaking than simply buying one was. None The agreements  according to documents reviewed by The New York Times  effectively gave a soccer agent  named in February as part of a money laundering investigation in Spain  permission to find buyers for at least five members of Fiorentina’s roster. In return  the agent would be paid a commission. If Fiorentina balked at completing any deal the agent brought to the club  he would receive a penalty fee instead. In effect  Fiorentina had agreed to offload some of its top players for a price negotiated by an outsider  for an amount it had not defined  or pay the agent a fee if it did not. “This agreement seems to guarantee a payment to the agency no matter whether a transfer actually takes place ” said Roy Vermeer  the legal director at FIFPro  the worldwide union for professional players. “It’s hard to understand the reason why any club would agree to this.” None Fiorentina executives declined to comment on the agreements  and Commisso was not available for comment  according to a spokeswoman. “For sure there was a strange relationship between Fiorentina and Ramadani ” said Pippo Russo  a sociologist at the University of Florence who has written books on the role of soccer agents in the transfer system. For much of the decade before Fiorentina’s American takeover  the club’s relationship with Ramadani was as close as one between a team and an individual agent could be. A frequent visitor to the club’s offices  Ramadani  a Macedonian businessman known for his access to some of the brightest prospects in the Balkans  sent a number of his clients to Fiorentina  including several that were still on the team’s books when it was sold to Commisso. None Pereira declined to comment on his role in the contracts  saying they were subject to confidentiality clauses. The agreements were all worded the same way  with the only differences being the amount of money or percentages that would go to Primus Sports. “A.C.F. Fiorentina is interested in monitoring the market in view of evaluating possible opportunities to transfer the player to another club within the territory of Europe and China ” the contracts said. Such agreements are not uncommon in soccer  clubs regularly enlist agents as they seek to offload unwanted players or try to raise funds. What was curious about the Fiorentina agreements  according to sports lawyers consulted by The Times  was not only the timing — so close to the sale of the club — but also the absence of any wording stipulating a minimum fee Fiorentina would accept. “Such offers shall be in line with the market value of the player ” each contract states without determining how that value will be determined. None Through connections  the authorities said  the group was able to exploit lax regulations to hide millions of dollars in commissions by moving athletes through what were described as so-called ghost clubs. By doing so  investigators said  the agents avoided paying taxes on the payments they received for brokering the deals. None None “What has been agreed has always been done within the rules and in the interest of Fiorentina ” Corvino said in a series of text messages over WhatsApp. Corvino added that the deal to sell the team to Commisso was completed in such secrecy  and so quickly  that he had not known Fiorentina was on the verge of being sold when the agreements were signed with Ramadani’s company. Fiorentina’s former executive president  Mario Cognigni  said the club had always complied with local regulations. “Please note that throughout my tenure as president of A.C.F. Fiorentina every single transaction has been carried out in the sole interest of the company and duly recorded in the relevant company’s books ” Cognigni said in an email. While Fiorentina officials declined to discuss the agreements  a spokesman for the team said only that the team’s previous managers had been replaced. “We would like to let you know that the current management of the club works in complete transparency and we have no exclusions to work with any agent who might have interesting players to offer to Fiorentina  as long as all the rules are respected ” the spokesman said by email. None A senior FIFA legal official with nearly two decades of experience in the soccer industry said he had never seen any agreements like them. None “It is plain wrong that the careers of professional footballers can be influenced by financial incentives to third parties ” Vermeer added. “We strongly oppose any arrangement that raises this possibility  and introduces a conflict of interest into player transfers.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/sports/soccer/liverpool-man-city.html,City Runs Past Liverpool in a Race That Ended Months Ago Advertisement Supported by On Soccer “How is it possible ” the coach of Liverpool’s champions asked himself recently  “that anybody is 20 points ahead of this team?” None MANCHESTER  England — The thought struck Jürgen Klopp last Monday night: a couple of days before his Liverpool team played Crystal Palace  three before thousands would descend on Liverpool’s streets to celebrate the league championship  sending the smoke from firecrackers and flares billowing into the sky. That night  Manchester City was hosting Burnley. It turned  fairly quickly  into one of those Manchester City performances: quick and beautiful and coldly ruthless. City scored three  four  five. Burnley seemed punch-drunk  unable to comprehend what was happening  just happy to survive. And that was when it occurred to Klopp. His Liverpool team had left this City side for dust this season  establishing an insurmountable lead at the top of the Premier League. “How is it possible ” Klopp asked himself  “that anybody is 20 points ahead of this team?” It was  he thought  so unlikely as to be unthinkable. None Liverpool’s excellence is the explicable part of what even Klopp finds inexplicable. As he has said  it is proof that he and his staff have done “at least a couple of things right.” Liverpool has won the title entirely through its own merit. But it has done so with such ease — with more games to spare than every single one of its predecessors — because of the shortcomings of the City team it deposed  the opposing pole in the rivalry that  it seems likely  will define the early 2020s in English soccer. None It is a team that  this season  not only remained good enough to produce a performance that took Klopp’s breath away three days before Liverpool was crowned champion  it is a team that  on Thursday night  inflicted Liverpool’s heaviest defeat in nearly three years. That  at first glance  felt like an answer  of sorts: a statement of intent from the deposed champion  a warning shot ahead of a resumption of hostilities next season. But the more City threatened to run riot  the more it felt like a question. How can a team this good  one capable of making Liverpool seem ordinary  be so far behind? Injuries  of course  have played its part. Losing Aymeric Laporte  in particular  and the departing Leroy Sané for a considerable proportion of the campaign was a blow. So  too  has poor planning: The decision to allow Vincent Kompany to leave at the end of last season and not replace him left City vulnerable in central defense. But this is one of the most ambitious projects soccer has ever seen. It has been put together precisely to meet Guardiola’s specifications  and with forensic attention to detail. That it should be so delicate that a couple of injuries  or one positional shortcoming in one of the most expensive squads ever assembled  should derail it to this extent is unsatisfactory. City has  after all  not fallen narrowly short. It has lost eight games this season: defeat at Norwich City  newly promoted and now rock bottom  was the most eye-catching  but far more significant is its record against the league’s upper echelons. City lost both at home and away to Manchester United and to Wolves. It lost at Tottenham  it lost at Liverpool  and it surrendered its title by losing at Chelsea. Beating Liverpool on Thursday  of course  improves that record  adds a little gloss. But this was a slightly curious game in a slightly curious circumstance: Liverpool  its intensity missing and its belief strangely fragile  simultaneously played dreadfully and created enough chances to score three goals. City offered its guest a guard of honor at the start of the game  and then promptly tore it to shreds  winning by 4-0  and having plenty of reason to believe it might have had twice that. It was a game held in an isolated state  one where the outcome had little material impact on anything — other than puncturing Liverpool’s reverie  a psychological blow that is not worthless — and where neither team was playing with any real pressure. It felt a little like an exhibition  a free hit  not quite an exception  but perhaps not evidence of a rule. The test  now  is how Guardiola resolves the issues that have beleaguered this campaign. He will look to recruit  of course  to fill the holes in his squad: across the defensive line  certainly  a replacement for Fernandinho in midfield  and another attacking option now that Sané is off to Bayern Munich. The emergence of Phil Foden and Eric Garcia  both excellent Thursday  will help  but reimagining the squad is not as simple as it might have been. Guardiola’s contract expires after next season  he may be rebuilding in what proves to be his last year at the club. It is also not a panacea. City’s problem is not simply a shortage of talent. In many ways  it is absurd to suggest this squad has any shortage of talent at all. It has been undone too often this season by individual mistakes for it to be a coincidence  that hints at an occasional drift in focus. Too many of its closest rivals have found ways to survive City’s onslaughts  and there have been times when Guardiola’s team  for so long so smooth  so confident  so devastating  has seemed a little stale  as if it is going through the motions  playing less from memory and more by rote. After four years  it may be that it is time not just for Guardiola to draft in fresh blood  but to conjure new ideas  too. Klopp is right  of course  that it is unthinkable that any team should be 20 points ahead of this Manchester City. Guardiola’s task is to make sure  this time next year  it seems impossible that it should ever have happened. Advertisement ,articles/sports

Australian rules football also gets underway this weekend  though Australia is not quite ready for full stadiums yet. But some 2 000 fans will be allowed into the stands for a game between the Port Adelaide Power and the Adelaide Crows. Other games will have no fans  including the opener between the Richmond Tigers and the Collingwood Magpies  which under normal conditions would have drawn 80 000 to Melbourne Cricket Ground. Australia  with a population five times that of New Zealand  has had 7 000 cases and 100 deaths. But its rate of new infections is down to about 20 a day. None Brazil  the spiritual home of soccer  was a candidate to host the women’s World Cup in 2023 for the first time. But citing the economic effects of the virus  Brazil pulled out of the bidding on Monday. None None The federation also said that because the country had hosted many major events in the recent past  including the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016  it might be at a disadvantage in the voting in any case. Brazil says it now plans to support the bid of Colombia. Japan and a joint bid by Australia and New Zealand are also still in the mix for the event. All the candidates would be first-time hosts. None After the first three rallies of the year  the season was halted. For now  just three events remain on the schedule.

Plus truncated soccer seasons  and the potential return of fans to tennis matches. None Three big men lock arms. Three from the other team do the same. At the referee’s signal  they lunge toward each other  their faces inches apart. Often there is a rule violation of some kind  and they have to get up and do it again. And maybe again. Doesn’t really sound like social distancing  does it? None Scrums  when the players’ faces come close to each other  would not be barred outright  but World Rugby is advising that they not be reset repeatedly by the referee. Tacklers will have to come in low  not upright  another situation with the potential for close face-to-face contact. The group also recommended barring huddles and spitting. It is advising that at halftime the ball be washed  and players don new uniforms. None None None France made the decision to truncate its soccer season rather than try to resume it. The teams in first place of each division were declared champions  and the teams at the bottom were relegated. Needless to say  not everyone was happy. The teams relegated from the top division  Amiens and Toulouse  have threatened legal action. None None In a sign of what may be to come for leagues around the world making decisions in the weeks ahead  teams are upset. None Also on Wednesday  in England  where the Premier League is pushing forward with resumption  the decision was made to start allowing contact in training. The league emphasized safety in its announcement. “The Premier League’s priority is the health and well being of all participants. Strict medical protocols are in place to ensure the training ground is the safest environment possible and players and staff will continue to be tested for Covid-19 twice a week.” There is no date yet set for a restart in England. France will start its 2020-21 season on Aug. 21. The first step is bringing sports back. The second is to add live fans into the mix. World Team Tennis thinks it is ready for Step 2.

None None Manchester City unceremoniously “finished” its season with 40 points  and Chelsea with 39. But because the season was suddenly halted midstream  not every team had played the same number of games: Some had played 16  others as few as 13. The solution was to decide the title on a points-per-game basis. Manchester City’s 40 points came in 16 games  or an average of 2.5 points per game. Chelsea’s 39 points in 15 games came to 2.6. None The issue will not arise in the men’s Premier League  because every effort is being made to complete its season  with an eye toward hanging on to billions in international television and gate money. Fans everywhere  after months of being starved for action  have welcomed back their sporting heroes with joy and gratitude. Except  perhaps  in Portugal. Benfica had its first match since the return of the Primeira soccer league on Thursday  a home game against Tondela. The match ended in a 0-0 draw  but that result did not sit well with some fans.

But now the league seems to have found a way to get some fans inside  one which U.S.-based teams might be able to imitate. The rules in Australia currently permit pubs  clubs and restaurants to admit customers  as long as there is no more than one person for every four square meters.

It was a great start for Jeonbuk  the defending champion. The stadium was empty and silent  although crowd noise was pumped in on occasion. Players and coaches on the sidelines wore masks — Jeonbuk’s had team logos. Players bumped fists instead of shaking hands. Even excessive conversations on the pitch were discouraged. None The league had originally been scheduled to start on Feb. 29 and run through early October. Now it will be extended to Nov. 8. In preparation for the resumption  more than 1 000 players and officials were tested for the virus and cleared to participate.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/sports/golf/sahith-theegala-pga-tour.html,Golfer’s Pro Journey Starts With a Burst Bubble None Sahith Theegala is starting his PGA Tour career just as the coronavirus infiltrated pro golf’s caravan. None Supported by None Sahith Theegala hardly remembered the details  but his father did. Well before he was a three-time All-American golfer at Pepperdine and long before he made his professional PGA Tour debut this past week at the Travelers Championship in Cromwell  Conn.  Theegala was a 10-year-old public course golfer trying to figure out fast greens. So his father  Muralidhar  who was born in Hyderabad  India  took him to a practice area at a local private country club he knew of near their home in the Los Angeles suburbs. In short order  a man walked up to them and delivered a clear message about race in golf. “Rather than saying  ‘Who are you?’ he just said  ‘You’re not supposed to be here.’ He just assumed that because of the color of our skin ” Muralidhar said. None Theegala  22  who is Indian-American  now faces the biggest challenge of any amateur’s path  turning pro  as one of the smattering of nonwhite players in a traditionally conservative sport. He also does so at one of the most tumultuous times in history  as the PGA Tour’s restricted environment has been infiltrated by positive tests for the coronavirus among golfers and their caddies. Standing 6-foot-3  with a languid and unorthodox swing and a sublime short game  Theegala will make the second PGA Tour start of his career this week at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit  hoping that his professional future can have a special impact. “In light of what’s going on  I’m proud of who I am and what I’m adding to the golf community in terms of diversity ” Theegala said. “Ultimately  we’re all trying to do the same thing in pro golf and that’s make a successful career. Hopefully there is some inspiration behind that  for people who watch me and realize that you don’t have to be the stereotypical white golfer.” None None “I always believed that my boy is something special ” Muralidhar Theegala said. “Hopefully things work out  and by the grace of God  he’ll do wonderful. But I believe that he was born to do something great.” At least once every two years  Muralidhar made it a point to bring the family back to India  where his parents still live. In 2001  Karuna  his wife and Sahith’s mother  began a battle with thyroid cancer  so her mother  Vijaya Laxmi  came to the United States to help with the children. Every year since  Laxmi has spent six months with them in California and six months back in India. Theegala balances his connection to India with a Southern California nonchalance: He’s warm and gentle  if not downright goofy at times. “I’m definitely very proud of my background and my Indian heritage ” Theegala said. “But when I’m around my friends and other golfers  it’s not something that I think about.” Theegala grew up in a family that emphasized academics and was enthralled by American sports. When Sahith was less than 2 years old  Muralidhar would prop the toddler up on his knee to watch Lakers games on television. When Muralidhar cheered  Sahith would get excited. And when Sahith got old enough to understand what was going on  he would cry when the Lakers lost. None At the first tournament he qualified for as a college freshman  Theegala had warmed up terribly on the driving range  struck by a case of nerves. So he decided to shake them off by intentionally hitting even worse shots. Shanks zipped by competitors trying to prepare  and chunks of grass and dirt barely got out of his shadow. Full-swing flop-shots from a foot off the chipping green made people fear for their safety. Pepperdine Coach Michael Beard was summoned from the clubhouse to see what his young star was doing  and was shocked to see Theegala get to the first tee  take out a handful of irons and swing left-handed. But when it was his time to tee off  the right-handed Theegala smashed a beautiful left-to-right fade in the narrow gap between a rock outcropping and a canyon. He then hit a 6-iron onto the par-5 green and two-putted for birdie to start his collegiate career. “I was looking at my assistant like  ‘He’s going to be OK ’” Beard recalled  with a laugh. “To me  that kind of sums him up. He’s very comfortable with who he is.” When Beard first began recruiting Theegala  he did so as much for the wunderkind’s resume as for his unconventional approach. Theegala had won the first tournament he played in at the age of 6  the prestigious Junior Worlds in San Diego  and won it again at ages 8 and 10. He moved up in age groups  holding his own against future PGA Tour pros like Xander Schauffele and Beau Hossler. But when Beard first saw him  Theegala also shoved clubs into the wrong slots in his bag  wore socks pulled halfway up his calves and shirt slightly untucked. (Theegala continued needing fashion help throughout his college career.) The Theegalas were not members of a private club  and Sahith was mostly playing at a public course called El Prado. “It’s literally a goat track. It’s horrible ” Beard said  adding that Theegala would play lots of tournaments to practice on better courses. Before Theegala made his professional debut in a small Outlaw Tour event in early June  he drove with Roy Cootes  his friend from junior golf and roommate for four years at Pepperdine  to Arizona where they stayed in an $80-per-night motel room. Theegala shot 62 in his first round as a pro before finishing in a tie for third  taking in about a $1 000 profit after the entry fee and expenses. It was all in an attempt to keep his game sharp  a very different process than most rising stars in the game who are often overburdened with instruction and over-reliant on technology to aid in improvement. “I was asking him how his short game is so put together  and he basically said nothing is mechanics-based ” Cootes said. “He’s just looking at the shot and trying to come up with the best situation to get it in the hole. He doesn’t care how he has to swing or what he has to do to get the ball in the hole. It’s so refreshing. It’s incredible.” But Theegala’s game was not as sharp as he’d hoped during his PGA Tour debut at the Travelers Championship last weekend  as he shot even par over two rounds and missed the cut. He called it “a great learning experience ” which didn’t change his lofty expectations going forward. “I don’t want to sound cocky or anything  but I’m playing to win ” Theegala said. “It’s not like I’m just playing to make the cut or anything like that. If you’re not trying to win  what are you doing?” Advertisement ,articles/sports

None The PGA Tour’s Memorial Tournament  scheduled next week in central Ohio  had hoped to pave the way for spectators to return to golf events during the coronavirus pandemic  and in turn perhaps provide a blueprint for how fans could safely attend other major American sports competitions. But on Monday  the tour and tournament organizers announced they were scrapping plans to allow as many as 8 000 fans per day at the event.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/sports/golf/who-won-travelers-tournament.html,Dustin Johnson Splashed and Rallied to a Travelers Championship Win Advertisement Supported by Johnson shot a career low 61 on Saturday and held on late Sunday to stretch his tour wins streak to 13 consecutive seasons. None None But by the final round Sunday afternoon  uncertainty  drama and the import that accompanies it seemed almost reassuringly familiar as another PGA Tour event closed with gripping  taut pressure. There was Dustin Johnson  ranked sixth on the tour  standing in a pond with his pants rolled up desperately trying to save par a few minutes after he hooked a tee shot out of bounds and close enough to a railway to be a stowaway. There was Brendon Todd  who began the day with a two-stroke lead  having to endure the dreaded despair of a shanked chip shot that ruined his round. There was Kevin Streelman making a late charge as if conjuring the mojo of his 2014 Travelers victory  when he finished the final round with seven consecutive birdies. None In the end at the T.P.C. River Highlands golf course about 12 miles outside Hartford  Conn.  Johnson had the right combination of strength off the tee and deftness on the greens to claim the championship by one stroke over Streelman. For Johnson  who shot a final round 67 to finish 19 under par for the tournament  it was his 21st tour victory and his first since he won the World Golf Championship event in Mexico in February 2019. Nonetheless  earning the Travelers title means that Johnson has won a tour event in each of the last 13 seasons. Only Jack Nicklaus  Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods have longer streaks for wins in consecutive PGA Tour seasons. “It’s obviously a great streak and anytime you’re mentioned with those names  it’s obviously a big accomplishment ” Johnson said Sunday. “But it was a long time between wins and hopefully I won’t have to wait that long again for the next one.” Johnson shot a career low 61 during Saturday’s third round and on Sunday was forced to wait through a weather delay of about an hour when thunderstorms moved through central Connecticut. Johnson was leading the tournament with three holes left to play at the time. “The rain delay didn’t help because I had time to think about things ” he said. “I had been on a nice roll before that.” It would be more accurate to say that Johnson had settled down after an adventurous stretch of golf when he chased down Todd but was suddenly staggered by wayward tee shots. In all  Johnson had three bogeys and four birdies in his final 12 holes. A bogey at the seventh hole began the topsy-turvy stretch  but Johnson rallied by sinking a 27-foot birdie putt that broke sharply from right to left on the eighth hole. He then birdied the next two holes as well. By the 13th hole  Johnson appeared to be in cruise control but then knocked his drive out of bounds to the left and struggled to make a bogey on what should have been an easy par 5 for the long-driving Johnson. But he rallied with a birdie on the next hole. On the 15th hole  a short  drive-able par 4  Johnson’s tee shot was heading for a pond to the left. Though the ball landed at high speed just a few feet from the water  luckily for Johnson it remained on the grass bank. “I hit a 3-hybrid very poorly ” Johnson said of the shot. “I don’t know what was going on with my tee balls today. And I was a little lucky there  but I still had to get up and down for par.” Johnson’s only chance to advance the golf ball toward the green from about 25 yards away was to wade into the pond  which he did after removing his shoes and socks and hiking up his pants to just below knee level. His chopping chip from the bank traveled about a third of the way to the green but Johnson  after being reunited with his shoes and socks  pitched his third shot within four feet of the hole. He made the par putt. A bogey on the 16th after the weather delay cut his lead over Streelman to one stroke  but Streelman  who shot 67 Sunday  could not replicate his 2014 magic on the greens. He finished with five successive pars. It was Streelman’s second runner-up finish of the year  having been second at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in February. “It’s a little disappointing  making a last birdie would have been nice ” Streelman said. “But I have to take a lot of positives. I just played beautifully.” Todd  who overcame golf’s dreaded swing yips a few years ago  held a two-stroke lead over Johnson when his approach shot to the par 4  12th hole drifted slightly right of the green. Todd was left with an awkward uphill chip shot within eight feet of the green. It was a delicate shot but Todd rocketed the ball off his wedge and it flew over the green and sharply to the right. Now needing a flop shot to ascend to the green  Todd’s attempt was short and rolled back down the hill. A putt still did not reach the green and two putts later Todd was out of contention after a triple-bogey seven. For Todd  it was the first time he had not made a par or better since the fourth hole of Thursday’s first round. The PGA Tour resumes next week at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit beginning July 2. Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/sports/golf/pga-golfer-positive-tests.html,Inside the PGA Tour Bubble  Silent Fairways and Mounting Cases Advertisement Supported by Tour officials sent golfers a health tracking device and expanded testing protocols as eight golfers pulled out of the Travelers Championship because of positive tests for the coronavirus. None CROMWELL  Conn. — When Sergio Garcia sank his final putt Thursday on an 18th green enveloped by a natural amphitheater customarily filled with thousands of fans  the golf ball’s rattle around inside the hole could be heard from 30 yards away. A minute later  as Garcia ascended a hill  the only sound was his pencil scratching a last number on a scorecard. The PGA Tour’s officials have said they are proud to be at the vanguard of major American sports returning to competition after the coronavirus shut down athletic events nationwide. But on Thursday at the Travelers Championship — the third fan-free event in the tour’s comeback — the noiselessness was an eerie contrast to a growing chatter about how much longer professional golf’s traveling circus would keep hopscotching around the country. Golf’s grand experiment to prove that an outdoor  noncontact sport operating on a nomad’s schedule could return safely during a pandemic was showing signs of the stress that comes with attempting the unprecedented. Denny McCarthy tested positive on Friday after waking up feeling “achy” and withdrew from the Travelers event. A playing partner from the first round  Bud Cauley  tested negative but withdrew from the tournament for precautionary reasons. The third golfer in that group  Matt Wallace  also tested negative and will continue to play. On Wednesday  four golfers withdrew from the tournament because of Covid-19 concerns  including Brooks Koepka and Webb Simpson  the fourth- and fifth-ranked players in the world. Koepka departed after his caddie  Ricky Elliott  tested positive for the virus as part of the PGA Tour’s multilayered testing system. Koepka’s brother  Chase  who had also qualified for the tournament  also withdrew after having played a Tuesday practice round with Brooks and Elliott. Earlier in the day  the former United States Open champion Graeme McDowell announced he would not compete because his caddie  Ken Comboy  tested positive for the coronavirus this week. None The departures sent a jolt through the golf community and had Jay Monahan  the PGA Tour commissioner  warning players of “serious repercussions” if they did not follow new  stricter safety protocols. Shane Lowry  the reigning British Open champion  said when asked if the withdrawals had jarred his colleagues: “The first couple of weeks have been kind of a kick in the backside to all of us.” Scores of golfers Thursday went out of their way to praise the safety measures imposed by the tour  including the world’s top-ranked golfer  Rory McIlroy. “There’s been almost 3 000 tests administered and the percentage of positive tests is under a quarter of a percent ” McIlroy said. “I think as a whole  it’s been going really well.” But McIlroy tellingly conceded there were “loose ends” that needed to be tied up  which may be at the crux of the matter. Many top players have been calling for their brethren to be far more diligent in adhering to social-distancing recommendations on the golf course  because the execution of those guidelines has been spotty at best. Players routinely bump fists  talk face-to-face with their caddies and stand shoulder-to-shoulder on tees and greens. Moreover  as other sports contemplate resuming competitive play within a so-called bubble for the players  golf has patently experienced how difficult it can be to maintain a safe zone once the athletes leave the playing arena. None Since Wednesday’s positive test results  leading players are trying to send the message that dicey individual choices run the risk of putting the entire tour back on hiatus. “If we start doing whatever we want  all of us  then it probably will be totally out of control and then it could get dangerous ” said Garcia  who said this week’s positive test results were “a wake-up call.” “It’s not back to normal ” he added. “It’s not what it used to be  and we have to realize that. We have to be trying to be as careful as possible.” The tour has taken new steps in hopes of keeping the circuit moving along on a weekly schedule that currently stretches throughout the year. Earlier this week  the tour distributed to every player a Whoop band  a device worn on the wrist or upper arm to monitor various medical data. A Whoop band worn by Watney had alerted him to an elevated respiratory rate and led to a second test for the coronavirus last week — just days after Watney had tested negative for the virus. Monahan announced on Wednesday that players boarding the tour-sponsored charter jet would be tested not only the day before the flight leaves but also shortly after it lands. He said that fitness trainers would now be on site to keep golfers from visiting local gyms and that players’ coaches were now part of the tour’s testing protocol. In talking to reporters  Monahan avoided specifically saying how many positive test results it would take for the PGA Tour to shut down. Keegan Bradley  who won the 2011 P.G.A. Championship  was asked Thursday what might happen if 10  or 15  or 20 players tested positive for Covid-19. “If we get to that point  I think that none of us will be playing ” Bradley answered.

Himself Advertisement Supported by DeChambeau gained 40 pounds and is now routinely hitting drives 50 yards past the competition. “I have to chase down the most scientifically efficient way to get the golf ball in the hole.” None None A physics major in college at Southern Methodist  he was barred by rules officials from using a protractor during rounds to accurately determine hole locations  and he would soak golf balls in Epsom salts to determine their center of gravity. DeChambeau signed autographs backward with his left hand even though he is right-handed. “I’m a total nonconformist  for me  it’s about going down rabbit holes ” DeChambeau said in a telephone interview Tuesday. “I have to chase down the most scientifically efficient way to get the golf ball in the hole.” This year  DeChambeau  26  is roiling the professional golf world with his gaudiest experiment yet. In the last eight months  including 90 days when he was bored while isolating because the coronavirus pandemic put golf on a hiatus  DeChambeau threw himself into an extreme weight lifting routine that added 40 pounds to his physique  most of it in his upper body. DeChambeau is now 240 pounds — the world’s top ranked player  Rory McIlroy  is listed at 160 — and routinely hitting drives 50 yards past the competition. His golf ball often travels at speeds approaching 200 miles an hour  and he envisions drives regularly flying 400 yards. Last week  when he was hitting balls on a tournament practice range  he was forced to back up 15 yards because his shots were sailing over a mammoth net meant to protect an adjacent neighborhood of homes hundreds of yards away. And DeChambeau is not done. He dreams of getting bigger and swinging harder during the next off-season. “If I could get to 260 pounds and swing it upward of 210 miles an hour and control the ball  that would be amazing ” said DeChambeau  who is among the favorites at the Travelers Championship  which begins Thursday at T.P.C. River Highlands in Cromwell  Conn.  It is a prediction that might put a fright in his colleagues who are already gobsmacked by what they have seen in the two weeks of tournaments since the PGA Tour resumed on June 11. “It was crazy  it was nuts  it’s unbelievable ” McIlroy said  describing DeChambeau’s tee shots. “He hit it like 375 into the wind.” This being golf  where the object is to knock a little ball into a hole roughly four inches wide  DeChambeau’s prodigious power has not yet translated to a victory this year  although he has four top-five finishes in his last five events. Accurate putting still remains an essential skill  and a balky putter in the final round of the Charles Schwab Challenge in mid-June kept him one stroke behind the eventual winner  Daniel Berger. A week later  DeChambeau also blamed a lack of touch on the greens for finishing tied for eighth at the RBC Heritage. But with his superhero build  and quirky charisma  there is a sense in the golf community that DeChambeau  who is ranked 11th in the world and has won five times on the PGA Tour  may be remaking the paradigm of a top golfer. Will the sport’s future players be shaped more like N.F.L. linebackers? And consequently  will the next generation of young golfers adopt heavy weight lifting regimens to mimic DeChambeau’s beefy frame? Social media has already found a new nickname for a trending golfer: #DeChambeauFlex. None Does a similar fate await DeChambeau? “I have a concern  I would look a little deeper into the safety of his swing ” said Joey Diovisalvi  who for two decades has trained scores of pro golfers — including one of the PGA Tour’s longest hitters  Dustin Johnson — in the biomechanics of the sport. “It’s important to understand what the effects are. Let’s make sure your body can handle that.” Diovisalvi  who operates a golf training center in Jupiter  Fla.  said he admired how DeChambeau has highlighted athleticism in golf but acknowledged that he had recently heard from many young golfers who wondered if DeChambeau’s regimen was worth pursuing. “Lifting too many weights or having too much load or stress on tendons  ligaments or skeletal structure at an early age is dangerous ” Diovisalvi said. “You have to remember that Bryson is a grown man.” DeChambeau insists he is carefully monitoring the demands that his golf swing imparts on his body with the aid of fitness specialists. “We have a protocol that I go through to ensure that my back and body are OK ” said DeChambeau  who then recalled 2017  when he was ranked 99th in the world. “I had debilitating back pain ” he said. “Three years later  I’m 40 pounds heavier and generating 20 or 25 miles an hour more ball speed. I’m as strong and as good as I’ve ever been. Clearly  something is working.” In the end  however  DeChambeau concedes he is doing something familiar: chasing down another rabbit hole. “And if I get bit in that hole  that’s actually a good thing ” he said. “I’ll learn from it. Most people are afraid of failure. I love failure because it tells me where to go next.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/sports/golf/pga-championship-san-francisco.html,P.G.A. Championship Will Proceed Without Fans Advertisement Supported by Men’s golf’s first major tournament of the year will be held Aug. 6 to 9 at San Francisco’s T.P.C. Harding Park. After initially expressing pessimism  California health officials approved the plan. None The trend toward fan-free tournaments gained new momentum on Monday when officials for the P.G.A. Championship announced that golf’s first major championship this year would proceed without spectators from Aug. 6 to 9 at T.P.C. Harding Park in San Francisco. The decision was made in coordination with officials from the state of California and the city and county of San Francisco  taking into account the health and well-being of participants during the coronavirus pandemic. The P.G.A. of America  which conducts the championship  had been considering moving the competition to another site  perhaps in the Southeast  although keeping the event in San Francisco had always been the preferred choice. The city last hosted a major tournament in 2012  when the United States Open was held at the Olympic Club. It will be the first major golf championship held at T.P.C. Harding Park. None “We are both inspired and honored to ‘play on ’” said Seth Waugh  the P.G.A. of America’s chief executive. He added: “While the local community cannot be with us physically on-site  we will certainly carry their spirit of resilience and unity with us as we stage our major championship  on their behalf  for all the world to see and enjoy.” In a statement  the P.G.A. of America said it would continue to monitor Covid-19 developments in concert with local and national public health authorities. None None None None At this point  only the Memorial Tournament in Dublin  Ohio  scheduled from July 16 to 19  is planning to host a limited number of spectators. State officials there approved a plan that caps the spectators allowed on the course at 8 000 daily for the event. None Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/sports/golf/daniel-berger-pga-charles-schwab.html,A Nerve-Racking Final Round Adds Drama to Golf’s Fan-Free Return Advertisement Supported by Daniel Berger forced a playoff with Collin Morikawa by sinking a birdie putt on the 18th hole  then went on to victory at Colonial Country Club. None None If the scheduled 18 holes end in a tie at the top of the leaderboard that leads to a tenser  more jittery playoff  then all the better. On that count  professional golf got its wish on Sunday with a star-studded leaderboard that included the game’s top players  who alternately soared and stumbled in what was an entertaining close to an eventful week for the sport. The Charles Schwab Challenge at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth began with the 148 players in the field successfully passing tests for the coronavirus. Then  near the beginning of each of the four rounds  players  caddies and officials at the golf course paused for a moment of silence in honor of George Floyd  whose death in Minneapolis police custody has sparked protests worldwide. Next  the golfers adapted to a new condition of tournament play: competition without fans. In the end  a one-hole playoff on Colonial’s 17th hole ended with a rising star on the tour  Collin Morikawa  23  missing a short par putt that handed the championship to Daniel Berger  another surging young player who has had to overcome serious  career-threatening injury. Berger clinched his berth in the playoff with a twisting birdie putt on the 72nd hole of the event. Morikawa could have clinched victory on the same 18th green  but missed a 3-foot putt. Berger  27  whose playoff record before Sunday was 0-2  commiserated with Morikawa. “Obviously  I didn’t want to win it like that  but sometimes that’s just the way golf goes ” said Berger  who now has three tour victories in his career and four top-10 finishes in 2020. “To be able to come out here and beat so many of the best players in the world — you look at the field that was out here this week and I don’t have a stellar playoff record — so to show up here this way  I’m very proud of myself.” Morikawa explained afterward that he struck the putt on the 18th hole as he intended  but had misread the break of the green. Of his missed playoff putt  he simply said  “Just not a good putt.” The best players in golf made a run at the tournament title on Sunday  including Patrick Reed  Bubba Watson  Justin Rose  Xander Schauffele and Bryson DeChambeau  all of whom finished within two strokes of the lead. The world’s top-ranked player  Rory McIlroy  began the day with a chance to catch the leaders  but bogeyed the first hole  the course’s easiest. Things went downhill from there. Playing at Colonial for the first time  he bogeyed the fourth  fifth and ninth holes and double-bogeyed the seventh  taking himself out of contention early. He finished with a four-over-par 74. Playing with McIlroy was DeChambeau  who was as buoyant as his partner was dispirited. DeChambeau had played the event four times and made the cut only once. He teed off Sunday three strokes behind Schauffele  the third-round leader  but with five birdies in a nine-hole stretch near the middle of his round  he charged into a tie for the lead. DeChambeau’s 145-yard approach shot to the 17th green flew long and into a difficult spot to chip from behind the hole. He did not recover well from that predicament  and the ensuing bogey dampened his momentum. Still  he had a chance to get into the playoff with a birdie attempt on 18 that he nearly holed. DeChambeau  whose newly enhanced  musclebound upper body allowed him to smash towering drives that overpowered the venerable Colonial layout  was not cowed by his final hole failings. “If I had putted well ” he said afterward  “I would have won by a lot this week. I’m very encouraged.” Berger’s comeback comes after a confusing  debilitating injury sustained in 2018. After tying for a sixth-place finish at the 2018 United States Open  he felt pain in his right index finger after hitting a shot at the tour’s next event  the Travelers Championship. Berger tried playing through the pain for months  but the discomfort not only got worse  it led to an inflammation of his right wrist. An extended rest was the medically recommended course of action. While Berger made strides in 2019  it wasn’t until this spring that he seemed to regain his old form  with a tie for ninth  a tie for fifth and a tie for fourth in three successive tour events. Berger said the health setbacks to his career helped motivate him. “There was so many times today where I could have given it up or let the pressure get to me ” he said. “But I hung in there and I played practically some of the best golf I’ve played during the last six years in the last five holes today.” None None Spieth was nonetheless feeling refreshed  and not just because he was back playing competitive golf again. “I definitely see progress ” Spieth said. “I knew coming in that I didn’t have all the tools. Didn’t have all my weapons yet. But I certainly gained more this week  gained a lot of confidence.” Bill Nichols contributed reporting. Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/sports/golf/charles-schwab-challenge-results-leaderboard.html,Varner Leads as Golf Makes Its Return in Pin-Drop Silence Advertisement Supported by Harold Varner III — after discussing racial injustice with PGA Tour leaders — finished Thursday’s opening round of the Charles Schwab Challenge tied with Justin Rose for first. None FORT WORTH — For many of the pro golfers who have not competed in a tournament in 90 days  the first round of the Charles Schwab Challenge was all about shaking off cobwebs from the PGA Tour’s hiatus. But for Harold Varner III  who finished the day in a two-way tie for the lead at seven under par  Thursday’s return was a respite of a different sort. Walking off the 18th green after matching Justin Rose’s 63  Varner  who is black  reflected on returning to play after an emotional few weeks leading the discussion in golf about racial injustice following the death of George Floyd in police custody. Coming off the course  Varner said the round had been a release. “Yeah  I know what’s going on  but when I’m on the golf course  I’m trying to play well ” Varner said. “The reason I have a platform is because I’m really good at golf. I just need to focus on that  and to be honest with you  being on the golf course  it helped me. It’s my getaway  I guess.” None None None None Although the tournament traditionally attracts solid fields  most regulars are primarily veterans — steeped in the lore of the accomplished player and longtime Fort Worth resident Ben Hogan — who relish shaping iron shots around the tree-lined doglegs. Many power hitters often skip the event because the course negates their distance advantage. None of the players really knew how their swings would fare in tournament conditions after such a long layoff  but with virtually no wind and calm conditions  Colonial was rendered defenseless. Rose  the No. 14-ranked golfer who won here two years ago  seemed in top form. His 7-under 63 featured seven birdies and no bogeys. He birdied three of his first five holes for a 31 on the back nine and then birdied holes one through three for a 32 on his front side. “I think everyone has been trying to do their best to prepare  and we’re certainly all coming in rested  that’s for sure ” Rose said. “But no one quite knows where their tournament game is. Although my game wasn’t great the first few holes  I made a couple of putts  knocked one in from just off the green on my first hole of the day  so I looked at my caddie and went  ‘welcome back.’” None None “We’re trying to follow the guidelines  but it’s amazing how routine and what you’ve done for 20 years kicks in  and you’ve got to keep reminding yourself ” Rose said. “I’m sure we all made a couple of mistakes out there  but we’re definitely very conscious of what we touch personally.” Some fans managed to find ways to catch the action. Behind the second tee  a group of 11 young adults pressed against a chain-link fence  peering over a hedge to catch glimpses of the action. On the back nine  several houses have erected makeshift mini grandstands. “Maybe they’ll come out to watch this weekend ” Rose said. Bill Pennington contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/sports/golf/us-open-final-round-fathers-day.html,No U.S. Open on Father’s Day This Year? It’s a Gift for This Correspondent Advertisement Supported by on golf For the first time since the 1970s  the final round of the tournament will not be played on the holiday. Our reporter reflects on what golf fans have lost — and he gained — this year. None Starting in 2004  it became an annual expectation that I would not be home on Father’s Day. Don’t feel sorry for me  especially if you’re a golf fan. I was covering the final round of the United States Open  held on Father’s Day every year since 1976. None And so the pandemic again jars our routines. There will be competitive golf to watch this weekend because the PGA Tour has filled the vacant spot with the RBC Heritage  an event in Hilton Head Island  S.C. It is a good tournament  but it will not provide the traditional Father’s Day television viewing because we won’t be watching several golfers late on a holiday Sunday struggling to endure the crucible of pursuing a victory at a major championship. And in many homes across the country  there also will not be a shared experience exclusive to Father’s Day. Not every household is filled with golf fans (ask my wife)  but alluring drama isn’t defined by the stage but by the adversity  perseverance  exaltation and pathos depicted on it. Fathers who play golf and the many more who simply like to watch it enjoy the fruits of many gifts on Father’s Day. Having their children and others important to them assemble to partake in — OK  put up with — a yearly ritual of watching the final hours of the U.S. Open is one of them. I know this because in my earliest days as a father of three  I was not usually covering the U.S. Open. But I camped out in front of the television  and my children and my wife mostly pretended to care about what was going on. (I did occasionally bribe them by setting up a prize-filled lottery  in which everyone in the house was allocated four contending golfers so that the winner of the tournament was not the only one celebrating.) But the point is  it was fun  and it indeed became tradition. It was togetherness. It was Father’s Day. Things certainly changed between when I sometimes covered the U.S. Open in the 1990s and it becoming a standard June assignment. At the tournament  the camaraderie of colleagues who were also away from their families  and the feeling that you’re lucky to be there — and plenty busy — made the day pass quickly. If the event wasn’t too far from my home in New York  my family would occasionally surprise me and appear at my lodging on Saturday night so we could at least have a Father’s Day breakfast. In time  my eldest daughter eventually got a job that sporadically intersected with golf  so she was working at U.S. Opens in the mid-2010s. As proof of the sibling bond  her younger sister and brother have found their way to two recent tournaments as well. I have noticed over the years that those kinds of family reunions happen often at the U.S. Open. Walking different courses over the decades  I’ve grown accustomed to seeing hundreds of parents and grandparents at the edges of fairways and greens with their children and grandchildren. It’s a sight more common at a U.S. Open than at other major championships  probably because the tickets were bought as a Father’s Day present. None Even when a father could not be at the climactic moment of a U.S. Open victory  he was not forgotten. In 2013  after Justin Rose sank the final putt in his victory  he looked and pointed skyward in a tribute to his late father  Ken  who had nurtured his love of the game. My streak of U.S. Open visits was broken last year  in a very literal sense  when I shattered an ankle while running in my neighborhood the day before my flight to the tournament. I spent my 2019 Father’s Day in a medicated haze following reconstructive surgery two days earlier. This week  I was looking forward to my U.S. Open return  but being home  and fit  for Father’s Day is a more than suitable outcome instead. Around the world  there are bigger things to weigh and solve than the interruption of a sport’s connection to an annual holiday. Know this  however: The final round of the 2021 U.S. Open is scheduled for June 20. It is  as usual  the third Sunday of the month  Father’s Day. Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/sports/golf/golf-pga-europe.html,In PGA Tour’s Rush to Move Forward  Foreign Pros Were Left Behind Advertisement Supported by “If I was living in America ” one England-based player said  “I’d be playing right now.” None England’s top player  Tommy Fleetwood  was the world No. 10  one spot ahead of Tiger Woods  when the PGA Tour suspended its schedule in March. With four top-3 finishes in his seven worldwide starts before the coronavirus halted the season  Fleetwood had momentum on his side. But when tour play resumed last week  he was on the wrong side of the Atlantic. In its haste to return  the tour  whose playing membership spans the globe  set up the stakes so that any player not based in the United States was effectively out of bounds. From Fleetwood’s perch in northwest England  the hazards were many  including a two-way quarantine  the possibility of catching the virus from a fellow passenger on a trans-Atlantic flight  and a months-long separation from his wife  Clare  their two-year-old son  Franklin  and his stepsons Oscar  13  and Mo  12. “If I was living in America ” Fleetwood said  “I’d be playing right now.” But he doesn’t  and so he is not. Golf is not the only sport that has forged ahead without the full support of its competitive membership. This week’s decision by the United States Tennis Association to hold its marquee event  the United States Open  later in the summer in New York  one of the cities hardest hit by the virus  drew a sharp rebuke from the Australian player Nick Kyrgios. On Twitter  Kyrgios described the move as “selfish” and wrote  “People that live in the U.S. of course are pushing the Open to go ahead.” He added  “I’ll get my hazmat suit ready for when I travel from Australia and then have to quarantine for two weeks on my return.” Kyrgios’s countryman Adam Scott  a former major winner  was the only player in men’s golf based outside the United States other than Fleetwood in the top-10 when the season was suspended. He also struggled with the idea of a restart  and some of his concerns were validated on Friday when Nick Watney  an American player  withdrew before the second round of the RBC Heritage in South Carolina after testing positive for the coronavirus. Watney had tested negative at the start of the week as a condition of entering the tour’s so-called bubble and playing this week. In an interview last month with an Australian news service  Scott  who is married with young children  expressed reservations about the tour’s testing protocols. He worried about contracting the virus from an asymptomatic player  and of triggering the nightmarish — for him — possibility of having to ride out the illness in self-isolation in a strange city  far from his family. Scott  39  said that he is not likely to return to the tour until late July  at the World Golf Championships event in Memphis. That is one week earlier than the Italian star Francesco Molinari  who was in the process of relocating his family from London to the United States when the lockdown began. The closure of most government offices prevented him from completing the embassy paperwork he needed to finalize the move. Molinari  37  now fully recovered from a back injury that kept him from defending his title at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March  expects his next tour start to be the year’s first contested major  the PGA Championship in San Francisco. Fleetwood  who has been in regular contact with Molinari over the past three months  also decided to sit out the restart. Instead  he will turn his PGA Tour return next month into an extended family summer vacation. With his wife and sons in tow  Fleetwood will travel to New York in mid-July  and after a two-week quarantine  rejoin the tour for the World Golf Championships. He plans to stay in the United States through the end of September. Fleetwood said he initially questioned the ethics of athletes’ jumping to the front of the line for coronavirus testing  leapfrogging essential workers. As testing has expanded  though  that concern has subsided  but the health and well-being of his family remains a primary concern. His stepson Oscar has Type 1 diabetes  putting him at more risk if he were to be infected with the coronavirus. Fleetwood said he could not imagine a situation in which he would leave his family behind for three months to fend for itself while the pandemic has not run its course. ““There are no easy answers when you live outside the United States ” said Fleetwood. He said he was mildly frustrated that the official world rankings  which were frozen in mid-March  were unlocked when the PGA Tour restarted  especially while other tours whose players are represented in the rankings remain suspended. Fleetwood stands to lose money in sponsors’ performance bonuses as his world ranking falls  but he said that would not alter his decisions. “My ranking drop doesn’t affect me as much as someone who’s trying to stay in the top-50 or top-100 ” he said. “Golf is more than the PGA Tour  and the players on the other tours are the ones who are really affected.” Lee Westwood  a former world No. 1  had dropped outside the top-70 last July  then soared to No. 30 on the strength of a victory in Abu Dhabi in January. Because he still has reservations about leaving his home in Britain to rejoin the tour  Westwood  47  is backsliding in the rankings  which play a role in filling the tournament fields in the most prestigious events. “I’m not very keen on flying at the moment  especially to the States  where they seem to have adopted a more relaxed approach to tackling the virus ” Westwood said in an interview with the daily golf newsletter Morning Read. “Our rules over here seem far tighter.” Not every player is concerned about the consequences of caution  however. Rory McIlroy  the Florida-based world No. 1 from Northern Ireland  expressed little sympathy for his fellow Europeans who are being displaced as part of the pandemic’s tectonic shifts. “If you really care about your career and care about moving forward  you should be here ” McIlroy said Wednesday during a virtual news conference from this week’s Tour stop  the RBC Heritage. But what about his fellow Europeans with young children  whose paths are not as straightforward? “I get there’s variables  families involved ” McIlroy said. “We all have the means to rent a very nice house in a gated community in Florida and it’s not a hardship for two weeks to come over and quarantine.” He added: “You can bring your family with you. We all have the means to do that. It might seem a little harsh but I don’t get that mind-set  especially if you care about your career and want to advance.” From 4 000 miles away  Fleetwood stood his ground. Yes  golf is important  he said  “but family comes first.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/sports/tennis/tennis-rankings-coronavirus.html,Tennis Tours Debate Ranking Systems Frozen by the Coronavirus Advertisement Supported by The rankings have key implications for tournament seedings and sponsor bonuses. None None Rankings are  in many respects  the coin of the tennis realm: the determining factor in players’ ability to enter events  receive seedings and even earn certain bonuses from sponsors. And the hiatus has created a new mathematical challenge for this global sport. As the tours prepare to resume in August  what is the best way to thaw the rankings that usually shift week by week? The Association of Tennis Professionals  which runs the men’s tour  and the Women’s Tennis Association  which runs the women’s tour  have debated long and hard about the fairest and smartest way forward. So has the International Tennis Federation  which operates lower-level professional events and oversees the junior  senior and wheelchair circuits. They have talked together  but their decisions are imminent and may differ. What is clear is that both the ATP and the WTA are prepared to deviate for the first time from the rolling 52-week system that has been in place since their ranking systems began in the 1970s. Golf’s world ranking system  by comparison  is based on results over two years. Normally  tennis rankings are updated weekly by adding results from the previous week and subtracting those from the equivalent week in the previous year. Consider an example: Naomi Osaka  the Japanese star  lost in the third round of the 2020 Australian Open after winning the singles title in 2019. After subtracting the 2 000 points from her 2019 victory and adding the 130 points she earned for reaching the third round in 2020  her ranking dropped to No. 10 from No. 4. The pandemic has disrupted that familiar rhythm. With the rankings frozen  results from April-June 2019 have yet to be subtracted  and remain part of each player’s ranking. If and when play restarts in August  there will be a lag for the rankings and also a logjam of rescheduled events. That creates opportunities for competitors to play and earn income  but players might be more cautious about the events they enter to avoid injury and fatigue as the season restarts. For the men  the schedule offers five large events  including two Grand Slam tournaments  in a span of just seven weeks on two continents and two surfaces: hard court and clay. Veteran stars like Rafael Nadal  34  and Andy Murray  33  are understandably skeptical that they can manage all of this  and they are concerned that the ranking system could quickly become skewed. “It’s not safe for players to go from the semis or final in New York  quarters even  and then you’re playing on the Tuesday in Madrid at altitude on the clay court  when players haven’t competed for a very long time ” Murray said. “You’re going to have the potential where a lot of top players are not competing at many of the biggest events.” The tours are also trying to help lower-ranked players get chances to accumulate points by adding lower-level tournaments alongside the main tour events. Both the ATP and WTA considered unfreezing the ranking at the start of 2021 and playing the remainder of the 2020 season without points. But that option was discarded because it would essentially transform tournaments into exhibitions  a prospect rejected by events like the United States Open  which has contractual deals with sponsors and broadcasters that are linked to the tournament’s ranking points. Another plan that was discarded was having points awarded for the remainder of 2020 that only counted toward qualifying for November’s year-end championships. That leaves two leading options on the table  both of which would allow some of a player’s ranking points to carry beyond 52 weeks  in an attempt to reduce the impact of re-entry. “Both are good and bad in different scenarios ” Ross Hutchins  the ATP’s chief player officer  said last month in a conference call with players. The first option would gradually deduct points from players’ unfrozen totals as they earn points when the tour resumes. The final points from the unfrozen total would come off by August 2021. The second  more complex option  which has been gathering momentum in recent weeks  would try to maintain the traditional system of matching up equivalent events despite all the shifting in the calendar. That would mean  for example  that the points from the 2019 French Open  which ended in June 2019  would not be at stake until the end of the 2020 French Open  which is now scheduled to end Oct. 11. This plan has the advantage of getting back more quickly to the traditional 52-week system. “Having a ranking which is a subsection of our current ranking is very challenging for a longer period ” Hutchins said. For the remaining events in 2020  the plan would let players preserve their result from 2019 if it was a better finish — whether they played in the 2020 event or not. The option is considered an attempt to protect players who cannot play in certain events because of public health concerns or travel restrictions. It would also lessen the rankings impact if the pandemic further disrupts the tournament schedule. The rub is that it could create friction with prestigious events like the U.S. Open. The choice would mean  for example  that Nadal  who won the U.S. Open men’s singles title in 2019  could keep those 2 000 points in his ranking even if he does not play in this year’s U.S. Open. Though the goal  in theory  is to take the pressure off players to perform at full throttle immediately  the knock-on effect is that they could skip big events entirely without penalty. Nadal does have the major incentive of chasing a 20th Grand Slam singles title  which would allow him to tie Roger Federer’s men’s record. But under this plan  he might be even more likely to prioritize the rescheduled French Open on his beloved red clay  rather than risk pushing himself too far by competing first in New York at the U.S. Open. If others decided to take such an approach  that could weaken the field considerably at the U.S. Open  which is scheduled to be played without spectators and with significant health restrictions in place  in a city that was once one of the global centers of the coronavirus.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/sports/tennis/french-open-fans.html,French Open  Unlike U.S. Open  to Allow Fans at its Tournament Advertisement Supported by The French Open  played on red-clay courts  is known generally for being the most crowded Grand Slam tournament. Organizers say they are planning for as many as 20 000 fans daily. None None But only the French Open intends to have spectators. Bernard Giudicelli  the president of the French Tennis Federation  said Thursday that the tournament could accommodate as many as 20 000 fans on site per day if the public health situation in France did not deteriorate. The French Open plans to operate at “50 to 60 percent” of its usual capacity  Giudicelli said. “This will allow us to respect the limits that we have agreed on with the French authorities ” he said in a videoconference with reporters. Originally set to begin in late May  the French Open was postponed because of the health crisis and is now scheduled to run from Sept. 27 to Oct. 11. None None None Regular tennis tour events like the Citi Open in Washington  D.C.  and the Mutua Madrid Open in Spain have not ruled out having spectators on site. None The grounds at Roland Garros Stadium are the smallest of the four Grand Slam venues  and the French Open has long been the most crowded major tournament with its tree-lined alleyways often resembling big-city sidewalks during rush hour. But the French Open is nearing the end of an expensive expansion designed to provide more elbow room  and Giudicelli expressed confidence that the tournament would be able to manage the health risks this year while working closely with medical experts and the French government. None For now  there are no plans to check spectators’ temperatures before entry or to require that they be tested for the virus. Mask use will be mandatory while moving about the grounds but not required when seated at a court  although the measures could change. On the three main show courts — Philippe Chatrier  Suzanne Lenglen and Simonne Mathieu — fans will be able to sit together in clusters of no more than four  with empty seats separating groups. On the outside courts  where seats are not individually ticketed  one of every two seats will be left empty to allow for social distancing  and even families will not be allowed to sit side by side. Jean-François Vilotte  general director of the French federation  said the expectation was that the main show courts would be able to operate at 60 to 70 percent of their normal capacity. Ticket prices for the French Open remain the same as those for the original dates. If the health situation in France continues to improve  Giudicelli said the tournament may sell additional tickets in September. If the situation deteriorates  he said the capacity could be further reduced  and some tickets refunded. Though tickets are available for purchase internationally  there is no plan to offer refunds to those from other countries who are unable to enter France because of health-related travel restrictions. For now  citizens of the United States are among those barred from entering the country. Much could change  but what is certain is that this will be an unusual year at Roland Garros. “This 2020 tournament will be in all ways a historic tournament ” Giudicelli said.

Reinstates U.S. Open Wheelchair Tournament Advertisement Supported by The tournament’s original framework released last week eliminated the competition  a decision many wheelchair players said had been made without consulting them. None None None But many wheelchair players complained that they had not been consulted about the decision and disagreed with it. They argued that their slot in the second week of the tournament meant that the overall number of players on site already would be reduced. None “But unfortunately I missed the only thing that mattered  being able to walk ” he said. The U.S.T.A. swiftly reconsidered its position last week  with chief executive Mike Dowse and Stacey Allaster  the U.S. Open tournament director  apologizing and offering multiple options to wheelchair players in a series of virtual meetings that also included representatives from the International Tennis Federation  which oversees the regular wheelchair tennis tour. According to players  the U.S.T.A. proposed three possibilities: a cash payment to be divided among the player pool  an event to be held later in the year at the U.S.T.A. National Campus in Orlando  Fla.  or a U.S. Open wheelchair tournament with slightly reduced prize money compared with 2019. The players were asked to inform the U.S.T.A. of their preferences  and on Wednesday  the U.S.T.A. announced that the wheelchair tournament would be held from Sept. 10-13 with wheelchair players granted access the tennis center on Sept. 7. Men’s and women’s singles and doubles will be contested along with quad singles and doubles  according to the U.S.T.A.  which said draw sizes will be similar to those at past U.S. Opens. “The U.S.T.A. said they had made a mistake and had a miscommunication among themselves ” said David Wagner  the leading American quad wheelchair player who was part of the virtual meetings. “It seemed like a pretty sincere apology  and it was accepted. And we moved on.” Wagner  46  an eight-time Paralympic medalist  was paralyzed after an accident on a California beach in 1995 and plays tennis with his right hand attached to his racket. “It was a combined effort by a lot of athletes ” Wagner said of the lobbying that changed the U.S.T.A.’s plans. “It was not just one athlete in particular preaching to their social media. It was a ton of athletes working for a common goal. I think we all grasped the gravity of the situation this year with the U.S. Open  but we wanted to get a better grasp of the U.S.T.A.’s decision-making process and try to get a better outcome.” None None Wagner said he planned on competing in New York if he was comfortable with the public health situation. The U.S.T.A. is planning to require social distancing and frequent testing. “It’s a concern  sure  just as much as for an able-bodied ATP or WTA player ” Wagner said of the coronavirus. “I’m not sure how much more susceptible I am. But I feel if I am going to play that would probably be the safest place. The U.S. Open has the means to ensure safety.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/sports/tennis/novak-djokovic-coronavirus.html,Novak Djokovic Tests Positive for the Coronavirus Advertisement Supported by The world No. 1 in men’s tennis is the fourth player found to be infected after he organized an exhibition series in Croatia and Serbia. None Novak Djokovic  the world’s top-ranked male tennis player  apologized on Tuesday as he announced that he and his wife  Jelena  had tested positive for the coronavirus. His mea culpa came after days of growing criticism over a tournament he organized  after which other players and coaches were also found to be infected. “I am so deeply sorry our tournament has caused harm ” Djokovic said on social media. The exhibition event  called the Adria Tour  was supposed to bring some of the world’s best players to Balkan nations  including Serbia  where Djokovic is from  and provide some income for the participants and some welcome entertainment to tennis fans who haven’t seen professional games since March. Social distancing was not enforced in the stands during the series  and face masks were a rare sight. Players mingled freely  exchanging hugs and handshakes  playing pickup soccer and basketball  and even dancing the limbo one night in Belgrade  Serbia. At the tournament  players posed for photographs with workers  tournament officials and spectators. No systematic coronavirus testing was required of the participants before the event began  according to the organizers. Some Croatian tennis officials are calling for the resignation of Nikolina Babic  president of the Croatian Tennis Federation. Besides the Djokovics  two coaches and at least three prominent players tested positive for the virus: Grigor Dimitrov  Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki  a Serb whose wife  Aleksandra  also tested positive. That prompted fears among the authorities in Croatia and Serbia that the athletes might have started a cluster of infections. In Zadar  a small coastal town in Croatia that had no confirmed infections until it hosted a leg of the competition  the authorities were left scrambling to trace and test people who might have come in contact with Dimitrov  a Bulgarian who said on Sunday after returning to his home base in Monaco that he had tested positive. “When we saw the crowds  everyone was surprised to see an event of that size come back so soon ” said Bob Bryan  the veteran American doubles champion who watched the action from his home in Florida. “I guess the cases were low in Croatia  and they thought they could. It’s a harsh reminder that there is still a pandemic going on and everyone has to behave responsibly.” Goran Ivanisevic  a former Wimbledon champion from Croatia who now coaches Djokovic  was the director of the event in Zadar. Ivanisevic  who said he had tested negative for the coronavirus  said it was unclear where and when Dimitrov contracted it. Ivanisevic said Dimitrov traveled to Serbia from Los Angeles and then traveled to Bulgaria before arriving in Croatia. Ivanisevic said local health officials informed the tour organizers that there was no requirement to test players or other attendees upon arrival if they were asymptomatic. “He came here on Wednesday and was complaining about his elbow ” Ivanisevic said by telephone  referring to Dimitrov. “The first time Grigor said he was not feeling great in general was on Friday  and on Saturday he played his first match against Coric. He didn’t look very good.” Dimitrov withdrew from his second match on Saturday  then decided to leave the event and return to Monaco. Ivanisevic said the coronavirus was almost impossible to understand. “I was two weeks with Marco Panichi  who is Novak’s fitness coach ” Ivanisevic said. “I was with him night and day  and he is positive  and I am negative  so how to explain that?” Djokovic returned to Belgrade with his family after the tournament’s final on Sunday was called off. “Everything we did in the past month  we did with a pure heart and sincere intentions ” Djokovic said in a statement announcing his positive test. “Our tournament meant to unite and share a message of solidarity and compassion throughout the region.” He said before the event began in Belgrade this month that the tour was following guidelines from local authorities by not imposing strict restrictions on player contact and by allowing spectators to attend matches. None Djokovic caused a stir in April after he suggested that he would rather not be vaccinated against the coronavirus. He has said he wants to know what is best for his body  while keeping an open mind. He has spoken frequently about his belief in natural healing and ventured far outside the mainstream in a podcast last month by maintaining that “molecules in the water react to our emotions.” But he sounded ready to embrace more conventional medical methods on Tuesday  urging all those who attended the Adria Tour or who were in contact with any attendees to be tested and to practice social distancing. Djokovic  whose primary organizational role in the tour was to recruit the players  said that his two young children — Stefan  5  and Tara  2 — had tested negative for the virus and that he would remain in isolation in Belgrade for the next 14 days and be retested later this week. The remainder of the tour  scheduled for Banja Luka and Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina  has been canceled. “It’s easy to be a general after a fight ” Ivanisevic said. “Everybody is smart now  and they are attacking Novak. He tried to do a great thing  a humanitarian thing. We were locked down for three months. He organized this tour. The players came in Belgrade and we had good tennis and a good atmosphere. Everything in Serbia and everything in Croatia was done with the recommendations by the government.” Three other leading players who took part in the tour — Marin Cilic  Alexander Zverev and Andrey Rublev — announced on Monday that they had tested negative for the virus but would also self-isolate for two weeks. Dominic Thiem  the Austrian ranked No. 3  who won the Belgrade leg of the tour  has since played in another exhibition event in France. He has tested negative three times for the virus. It is unclear whether he  too  will be required to self-isolate. Djokovic  33  is not only the top player in the world  he is also president of the ATP Player Council  which has been actively involved in planning for the return of the regular men’s tour. The tour has been shut down since March because of the pandemic and is now scheduled to resume in mid-August at the earliest. The plan is to do so without spectators and with strict testing and health protocols in place. Several players have criticized Djokovic’s decision to organize the Adria Tour without any such measures  arguing that it not only risked public health  but sent the wrong message to the wider world. “Apparently there’s a pandemic ” Andy Roddick  a former No. 1 from the United States  wrote on Twitter. “A horror show ” Bruno Soares  a Brazilian doubles star who is also a member of the player council  said in an interview with GloboEsporte. “With the situation in the world  even if you are at the North Pole  you don’t go out and party and post the photos on Instagram.” None What is undeniable is that the party in Zadar is now over  and that the rest of the tennis world has a cautionary tale to consider as it prepares for its official return. “This situation is exactly why we have created a comprehensive health and medical plan with the input of our medical advisory group  as well as other experts  that was approved by New York State ” the United States Tennis Association said in a statement on Tuesday about this year’s United States Open.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/sports/tennis/djokovic-exhibition-positive-tests-coronavirus.html,After Virus Tests  Djokovic Is Criticized for Holding Exhibition Advertisement Supported by A match on the Adria Tour  an exhibition circuit organized by Novak Djokovic in the Balkans  was canceled on Sunday after a player tested positive for the coronavirus. None They have not only played tennis in front of big crowds on the Adria Tour. They have hugged  high-fived  and partied together: Some of the players even formed a line and did the limbo on a night out in Belgrade  Serbia. But the consequences have quickly become much more serious than the mood with two of the tour’s main attractions  Grigor Dimitrov and Borna Coric  announcing they tested positive for the coronavirus and another  Viktor Troicki  doing so  according to a Serbian media report. None Nick Kyrgios  tweeting from his home nation  Australia  called it “a boneheaded decision” to play the event. None None “I am so sorry for any harm I might have caused ” Dimitrov said on social media. None Three other players on the Adria Tour — Alexander Zverev  Marin Cilic and Andrey Rublev — announced Monday that they had tested negative for the virus but would be self-isolating for 14 days. None Dimitrov’s announcement forced event officials to call off Sunday’s final between Djokovic and Rublev. Djokovic  who was in frequent physical contact with Dimitrov during the tour  returned to Belgrade to await his test result. The remainder of the Adria Tour  scheduled to head to Montenegro this week  is now very much in doubt. But the response over the lack of social distancing — which included pickup basketball and a group photo with ball kids — from some in the tennis community has been swift and severe. “I sum it up as a horror show ” Bruno Soares  a member of the ATP Player Council  of which Djokovic is president  said in an interview with the Brazilian news outlet GloboEsporte. “Enormous irresponsibility and huge immaturity. They were totally careless  and it’s difficult for me to find the words.” No paragon of self-restraint  Kyrgios has been suspended from the tour for misbehavior and fined frequently. But in this health crisis  he has urged tennis to take a conservative approach  as he also criticized the recent decision to hold the 2020 United States Open on its originally scheduled dates. But the U.S. Open and the regular tour events that will precede it are to be played without spectators and with strict social distancing requirements. There have been no such limits on the Adria Tour  in part  as Djokovic has explained  because local authorities did not require them. Serbia and neighboring countries have had comparatively few positive coronavirus cases and reported deaths. Even before Dimitrov and Coric tested positive  there was concern about the optics of full stadiums and partying players with so many still suffering worldwide. “You’ve got to be aware of who you are and leading by example ” said Patrick McEnroe  an ESPN analyst and former player who has recovered from the coronavirus  referring to Djokovic. He added that it would be “hard to imagine” another top player  like Rafael Nadal  Roger Federer or Serena Williams  holding a similar tour.  When the men’s and women’s tours shut down in March because of the pandemic  Djokovic was undefeated on court in 2020  but he has hardly been on a winning streak during the extended break. He has incited controversy by questioning the necessity of an eventual coronavirus vaccine and explaining that he would have a hard decision to make if getting one were required by the tour. When the U.S. Open announced its plans to protect players from the virus by limiting the size of entourages and restricting players’ movement  Djokovic was an outspoken critic of the idea  calling the plan “extreme” and questioning whether he would play. But the risks of taking a less cautious approach are now clear  particularly in a sport with an international group of players who have to travel. “Hopefully people will be able to discern that this isn’t an issue with the concept of returning to tennis but of how you return to tennis ” said Mark Ein  the owner of the Citi Open in Washington  which is scheduled to be the comeback event for the ATP Tour in August. “Even if places feel safe  it’s still prudent to take the basic precautions.” Andrea Gaudenzi  the ATP chairman  said the tour had recommended that players competing on the Adria Tour and in other unsanctioned events take “proper precautions and respect social distancing.” But ultimately the ATP had no jurisdiction to impose safety regulations. “Obviously we feel sorry for the players ” Gaudenzi said in a telephone interview. “We want them to recover as soon as possible. I know there has been a lot of criticism  but on the other hand  we at the ATP  the U.S.T.A.  and everybody  we have to be careful because we also have to be conscious that even with extreme measures  you could actually end up having some players testing positive. You don’t need players and people hugging each other for someone to test positive. So we’re all running the risk.” The positive tests on the Adria Tour could help make subsequent events safer  Gaudenzi said  by making players more willing to stay in the restricted environment imposed to reduce the risk of infection. “It’s a little bit like when you tell your kids when they try to learn to ride the bike to wear the helmet ” Gaudenzi said. “It’s ‘no  no  no’. And they ride the bike  they fall  and then they wear the helmet. Now we all know we can get this very easily  so we’re going to be even more careful  and maybe we will have a little bit more tolerance toward the bubble.” It is also a reminder to event organizers — like Bob Moran  the tournament director of the Credit One Bank Invitational  a six-day women’s team exhibition in Charleston  S.C. — of the importance of safety measures. The participants in the event  which is set to begin without spectators on Tuesday  include Sofia Kenin  this year’s Australian Open champion  and Sloane Stephens  a former U.S. Open champion. According to Moran  players have been practicing social distancing and wearing masks on site when not training or competing. Nets and sitting areas are being sanitized after practice sessions. “Honestly  I think it’s two different animals ” Moran said of his event and the Adria Tour. He added: “The players who have tested positive are all players these women know and have spent time with. It’s very unfortunate. I hate to see this happen and hate to see it happen now  but it’s just again re-emphasizing why we’re taking all the precautions we are taking.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/sports/tennis/serena-williams-us-open.html,As Other Stars Waver  Serena Williams Says She’ll Play in the U.S. Open Advertisement Supported by The men’s and women’s tennis tours are set to resume in August  as both circuits announced their plans on Wednesday. None As the tennis tours laid out their road maps on Wednesday for a return to play in August  Serena Williams confirmed her desire to be a major part of those comeback plans and to play in this year’s United States Open. “Ultimately I really cannot wait to return to New York and play ” she said in a video message. “I feel like the U.S.T.A. is going to do a really good job of ensuring everything is amazing and everything is perfect and everyone is safe.” Her announcement was welcome news for the Open  a Grand Slam that is unlikely to draw a full-strength field this year without spectators on site and with extraordinary health and safety measures because of the coronavirus pandemic. “I’ll certainly miss the fans  don’t get me wrong ” said Williams  still ranked No. 9 in singles at age 38. “Just being out there in the New York crowd  hearing everyone cheer — I’ll miss that  getting me through some of those tough matches.” None None None “I would be surprised if it’s 100 percent ” Steve Simon  head of the WTA Tour  said of the women’s field. “I think their positions will evolve based on what’s happening in the world. Some will be comfortable with it  some will not. No one is forcing anyone to play.” None John Isner  the top-ranked American men’s player in singles at No. 21  also is intent on playing. “I think it’s important for sport to get back and this is a good opportunity to get tennis back in the mainstream ” he said in a text message. None None The men’s and women’s tours have been on hiatus since mid-March because of the pandemic. Though tennis is particularly suited to social distancing with a net separating players  the global nature of the professional tours is a major obstacle. Though no schedule can be definite at this anxious stage  both tours announced their comeback plans on Wednesday. The women’s tour is set to resume on Aug. 3 with a clay-court event in Palermo  Italy  followed by potential tournaments in Prague and Washington. Then it would continue to the doubleheader in New York with the transplanted Western & Southern Open preceding the U.S. Open from Aug. 21 to 28. The men’s tour would resume with the Citi Open in Washington on Aug. 14 with the New York doubleheader to follow. After the U.S. Open  both tours would head to Europe for the postponed clay-court season with combined events in Madrid and Rome and then the French Open  a Grand Slam tournament that was rescheduled from late May to Sept. 27 to Oct. 11. Unlike the U.S. Open  the Madrid Open and French Open could be played with spectators. Mark Ein  who owns the Citi Open in Washington  has also not ruled out having a restricted number of fans. He said the tournament would undoubtedly operate at a loss this year  but maintained that it was worth the sacrifice. “I have often asked myself  ‘Why are we doing this?’” he said. “I just think it’s been such a hard year in our world and our community. I think this is something people will look forward to. It’s a real honor to have this opportunity  but it’s also a big responsibility.” Ein said the Citi Open  like the U.S.T.A. in New York  would create a controlled environment for players and staff with frequent testing and limited numbers of people permitted on site to reduce the risk of infection. Ein said players would travel independently from Washington to New York  just as international players are expected to arrive independently in the United States. U.S. Open officials indicated that instead of using tracking or security measures they are counting on players being judicious enough not to venture outside the bubble and jeopardize the health of others involved in the tournament. “If they do become infected  the way the inner bubble is  they will not be in physical contact with any of the other players ” Brian Hainline  a U.S.T.A. vice president  said of the planned social distancing measures. “If someone does test positive during the tournament  we’re confident that disease won’t spread to the other players because of how everything has been worked out and modeled.” Both tours have struck deals with tournaments to reduce prize money this season to compensate for the expected loss of revenues from ticket sales and sponsorships. Simon said the reductions on the WTA Tour ranged from 18 percent for low-level international events to more than 32 percent for top-tier Premier Mandatory events like Madrid. The men’s tour will flip that model  with its Masters 1000 events making smaller prize money reductions proportionally than lower-tier events. Simon said if the provisional schedule holds true  the WTA Tour will have managed to play about “60 percent” of its original 2020 calendar. Both tours are also intent on preserving their tour finals — the ATP’s in London and the WTA’s in Shenzhen  China — which represent a major chunk of their revenue. “If we can play the finals this year  we’ll be in a much better position than if we don’t ” Simon said. “But either way  like everybody else  we’ve been hurt this year significantly.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/sports/us-open-tennis-cuomo.html,Cuomo Announces Support of U.S. Open in New York Advertisement Supported by The backing of state officials for the tournament has been a key part of restarting the men’s and women’s tours. None Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced Tuesday that the United States Open would be held as originally scheduled but without spectators at the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens  approving a plan by the United States Tennis Association to salvage the Grand Slam tournament  one of the biggest sporting events in New York. “It will be held without fans  but we can watch it on TV  and I’ll take that ” the governor said. The Open is scheduled for Aug. 31 to Sept. 13. It will be preceded by the Western & Southern Open  a combined men’s and women’s event that is usually held in Mason  Ohio  earlier in August. Instead  it will be moved to New York this year to centralize operations  manage costs and limit player travel. The Western & Southern Open will also be played without spectators. The extraordinary doubleheader already had the backing of the leaders of the men’s and women’s tennis tours  which have been looking for a way to restart the sport and regenerate income during the coronavirus pandemic while also managing the misgivings of top players who have expressed concerns about safety and travel restrictions. The majority of professional tennis players are European  and most players are based outside the United States (18 of the top 120 women are American as are 10 of the top 120 men). The U.S. Open’s new guidelines are likely to curtail players’ movements in New York and limit the size of their entourages to allow for social distancing at the National Tennis Center. Players and their staffs will be required to wear masks at the tennis center when not competing or training. Access to the locker room and other shared spaces will be regulated  and seeded players will have access to unused hospitality suites as lounge areas. Though there was once discussion of chartering planes to bring players to the tournament  the plan now is for them to travel on their own. There are unresolved questions about whether players and their teams will be required to quarantine when they arrive in and depart from the United States. Though regional exhibitions are taking place  the professional tours have been shut down since mid-March  when the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells  Calif.  was canceled shortly before it was to begin. “We recognize the tremendous responsibility of hosting one of the first global sporting events in these challenging times  and we will do so in the safest manner possible  mitigating all potential risks ” Mike Dowse  the new chief executive of the U.S.T.A.  said in a statement. “We now can give fans around the world the chance to watch tennis’s top athletes compete for a U.S. Open title  and we can showcase tennis as the ideal social distancing sport.” It is unlikely that all of tennis’s top players will choose to play  which could spark debate about whether this year’s Open deserves an asterisk. The qualifying tournaments have been eliminated and doubles draws are expected to be reduced from 64 teams to 32. None The normal singles draws of 128 players will be maintained and the U.S.T.A. also has insisted that the tournament continue to award ranking points despite protests from some players who believe that would penalize those who do not make the journey. Other top players  including Novak Djokovic of Serbia and Simona Halep of Romania  have expressed doubts about playing. John Millman  a veteran Australian who reached the quarterfinals of the 2018 U.S. Open  tweeted last week: “I love the U.S. Open but it seems a little crazy that we’re still contemplating playing a Grand Slam there  right?” The U.S.T.A.’s plan to hold the Open was widely considered far-fetched when New York was an epicenter of the pandemic and a section of the National Tennis Center was being used as a temporary 350-bed hospital. But as the governor made clear on Tuesday  New York is no longer the epicenter. “Our rate of transmission is the lowest in the United States  having been the highest at one point ” he said  while continuing to urge caution from the public. “You have to stay smart  and you have to stay responsible ” he said. The absence of spectators will certainly be a financial hit for the U.S.T.A.  which gets most of its funding from the tournament. More than 700 000 fans attended the 2019 U.S. Open  and the loss of revenue will include ticket sales  on-site hospitality and concessions. But the organization still has the support of its primary sponsors and ESPN  which pays more than $70 million annually in rights fees mainly to televise the tournament. The U.S.T.A. intends to pay out approximately $52 million in prize money  close to the U.S. Open total of $57 million in 2019. Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/sports/tennis/us-open.html,U.S.T.A. Plans to Move Forward With U.S. Open Amid Pandemic Advertisement Supported by The plan for a doubleheader of tournaments at the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center still needs formal government approval. And it’s unclear how many players will take part. None None The tournament is expected to run as originally scheduled from Aug. 31 to Sept. 13  but without spectators  at the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Formal government approval still needs to be secured for the Open to take place  Chris Widmaier  a U.S.T.A. spokesman  said on Monday. “From the beginning  we’ve built this plan in a very collaborative manner ” he said  adding that the U.S.T.A. had consulted regularly with medical and security experts. “We also recognize in order to move forward that we need government approval  approval from the state of New York and any other entity.” Even if the tournament is soon confirmed  more than two months will remain before it begins  and outside forces  including the path of the virus and global travel restrictions  may still scuttle the U.S.T.A.’s plans. The field is also likely to be thinner than usual  with athletes making individual decisions about whether to compete. None In a normal year  the U.S. Open would be the fourth and final Grand Slam tournament. But the men’s and women’s tours have been shut down since March because of the public health crisis. The start of the French Open  normally the second Grand Slam tournament of the year  has been postponed until late September. Wimbledon  the oldest of the major tournaments  was canceled for the first time since 1945. “Our team has literally worked around the clock to figure out a way we can have the U.S. Open and do it in a safe way ” Patrick Galbraith  the president of the U.S.T.A.  said in a conference call with more than 400 men’s players and coaches on Wednesday. There has been considerable resistance from international players to the centralized U.S. Open plan. Players will be subject to frequent coronavirus testing. Many will be lodged together at a hotel outside Manhattan  and some restrictions are expected to be placed on their movement to protect their health. “Without having close social contact  we feel if one player gets it  it’s not going to spread ” Galbraith said in the conference call. “Our infectious disease specialists are confident on that. They are going to be pulled out of the environment  but you have to have close contact to get this.” To reduce the number of people at the National Tennis Center  the U.S.T.A. also plans to reduce the amount of support staff that players may bring to New York  potentially to as few as one team member. That would represent quite a change for the game’s biggest stars  who typically travel with large entourages including family. The men’s top-ranked player  Novak Djokovic  who is from Serbia and based in Monaco  has criticized the restrictions as “extreme.” As if to underscore the point  he organized a series of exhibition tournaments this month in the Balkans that began with an event last week in Belgrade  Serbia’s capital  with fans in the stands  ball kids on the court and players hugging and high-fiving. Several top women’s players have expressed uncertainty about playing in the Open  including top-ranked Ashleigh Barty and second-ranked Simona Halep. “Not only because we’re in the middle of a global pandemic ” said Halep  who is from Romania. “But also because of the risk of travel  potential quarantine and then the changes around the tournament.” But Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic  the women’s No. 3 and a U.S. Open finalist in 2016  said she was confident the U.S.T.A. could keep players safe. “At some point it needs to start  the season ” she said by telephone. “Even if it’s next year  I’m sure there is still going to be some sick people  so it’s never going to be like super  super safe  so I think the earlier we start the better it’s going to be.” Pliskova  like others  lobbied for an increase in the size of her team so she could bring a coach and a physical therapist  which would not force her to rely on a busy tournament-supplied therapist for treatment. “I would appreciate if two people could go at least ” she said. Widmaier said the number of team members could increase. “At its core  the plan is about mitigating risk ” he said. He added  “The absolute number of people who will be on site at any one time is not a fixed number here in mid-June.” None Eric Butorac  the U.S.T.A.’s director of player relations  said during Wednesday’s conference call that the U.S.T.A. did not expect players to have to isolate upon arrival in the United States before playing. Last week’s call was often contentious  with one former U.S. Open singles champion  Marin Cilic of Croatia  even clamoring for more prize money given the conditions. But the ATP board of directors  which governs the men’s tour  ultimately supported the decision to go forward  according to an ATP official familiar with the board’s decision who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans had not been announced. The U.S.T.A. does not require approval from the tours to hold the U.S. Open  but it did want to secure it before proceeding. The plan still includes moving the Western & Southern Open  a combined men’s and women’s tour event  to Queens from Mason  Ohio  to create a tennis doubleheader. It would be held primarily the week before the U.S. Open. The Citi Open  a combined men’s and women’s event in Washington  could still be the comeback event for the tours earlier in the month. The U.S. Open singles qualifying tournaments are not expected to be played. But the U.S.T.A.  which has committed to roughly $52 million in prize money  is providing more than $2 million apiece to the men’s and women’s tours to compensate lower-ranked players affected by the absence of qualifying. The reluctance of some stars to commit and the absence of qualifying have led some players to argue that in the interest of fairness  the Open should offer reduced ranking points this year or even none at all. The U.S.T.A. has rejected that idea because it could compromise its existing contracts by turning the event into an exhibition. Despite internal disagreements in recent weeks  the ATP Player Council did not oppose the decision to stage the Open. None But his rivals could have difficult decisions to make as they manage their priorities and preserve their bodies. The schedule will be tightly packed if the tours are able to resume as planned. Nadal  who just turned 34  is the reigning U.S. Open champion  but he is also the reigning champion at the French Open  where he has won a record 12 singles titles. If he were to play in New York  he would have to make a quick transition from American hardcourts to European clay with the French Open expected to start on Sept. 27 with lead-in events likely in Madrid and Rome. That is a great deal of top-flight tennis to ask of a veteran superstar after a five-month layoff  particularly if the U.S. Open and French Open stick to their traditional format of best-of-five-set singles matches. Another concern is whether European authorities will require players to quarantine upon arrival from the United States. “That would be very tough ” Galbraith told the players in last week’s conference call. “But Europe is starting to open up  and by July 1 most of the countries are waiving their 14-day quarantine. So that makes me optimistic. The main thing is just watching the virus  to be honest with you  to see  does it increase in the U.S.? Is it increasing in Europe? Is it hard to travel?” There is also concern about quarantine requirements in Asia  where the women’s tour and men’s tour have numerous events scheduled near the end of the season. But for now  the plan is to proceed in New York. “The constraints and policies will be a bit of an adjustment and are certainly not ideal ” Danielle Collins  an American player  said in an email last week. She added  “We want to be doing what we’re passionate about  and if that means making adjustments for the short time being  so be it.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/sports/tennis/coronavirus-french-open-schedule.html,The French Cut the Tennis Tournament Line. And They Are Not Sorry. Advertisement Supported by on tennis With little consultation  the French Open moved to September from June  causing scheduling headaches it says it could not help. None The men’s singles final at the French Open was supposed to be Sunday  with fans sporting Panama hats  players sliding on the red clay and a new retractable roof overhead that  given Sunday’s fine forecast  would most likely have remained open. But that plan was made before the tennis schedule  like so many others in sports  was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. The rebuilt center court at Roland Garros will be quiet instead of boisterous. No Rafael Nadal  the 12-time French Open men’s singles champion. No Novak Djokovic  the world’s No. 1 player. No Guy Forget  the French Open tournament director who  like his French compatriots  is just emerging from lockdown as the country slowly reopens. “Things are getting more flexible now and a bit less strict ” Forget said in a telephone interview this week. “We want to be optimistic with the understanding that things have been so crazy in the last few weeks and months that you never know what is going to happen. So we have to stay very careful and very humble.” Humility was an issue when the leaders of the French Tennis Federation postponed the French Open until late September without seeking approval from tennis’s other governing bodies  including the men’s and women’s tours. The unilateral decision was a tennis land grab born of desperation. The French Open  one of the four Grand Slam tournaments  provides the French federation  which largely finances the game in France  with about 80 percent of its annual revenue. But it was also a land grab perceived as selfish because so many other federations and tournaments are in dire financial positions  too. The French move prevented some other tournaments from shifting dates and created scheduling clashes with less prestigious events already on the calendar in September and early October. The Laver Cup  Roger Federer’s team event  already has been postponed to 2021 as a consequence. Why allow the French to cut in line? Forget  a former top five singles player and two-time Davis Cup champion  said the French federation and its president  Bernard Giudicelli  felt the calculated risk was necessary and that negotiations would have risked losing the opportunity to move into the small window available when the weather outdoors in Paris was still conducive to playing the full tournament. “We knew it would make a lot of waves  but looking back it was the right decision ” Forget said. “I know it can be perceived by some people in a selfish way. Funny enough  I have read comments from players who said  ‘How can they do this or do that?’ But in the end the players are the ones who are suffering and the ones who have to pay their bills  and basically we are trying to put in the best prize money possible  and they will benefit from it as well.” Darwinian as it might seem  Forget is not alone in the view that the Grand Slam tournaments deserve priority in the rush to the lifeboats. “Those are our tent-pole events  the ones that keep the lights on for everyone ” said Jim Courier  an American who won the French Open in 1991 and 1992 and works as a television analyst. “We need to nurture those as much as possible  but everyone needs to work together.” The leaders of the United States Tennis Association would certainly have liked to preserve the option to shift their own Grand Slam tournament  the United States Open  especially with New York hit hard by the coronavirus. None There is no guarantee  of course  that the French Open can be played in its new dates: most likely Sept. 27 to Oct. 11  with the qualifying event starting on Sept. 21. A resurgence in coronavirus cases could force another shutdown in France or continue to block players from traveling. But the French government is supportive  and because the majority of men’s and women’s players are European  travel could be simplified. If the public health situation continues to stabilize  Forget and Giudicelli are optimistic their tournament will take place with some spectators  at least on the main show courts. “It could be one every three seats ” Forget said. “Playing behind closed doors is really not something we would like to have.” The U.S. Open  still scheduled for Aug. 31 to Sept. 13  plans to bar spectators and put players in a “bubble” to protect their health. The conditions would require frequent testing for the virus  smaller player entourages and possibly restricting player movements to travel between their accommodations and the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Though there will be an official hotel  players have been told they could stay in nearby private accommodations as long as they adhered to the health requirements. The U.S.T.A. will decide later this month whether to stage the Open. Government approval will be required. But player buy-in is also important  and there has been early resistance to the bubble concept from some on the ATP Player Council  which includes the men’s game’s biggest stars: Nadal  Djokovic and Federer. Djokovic said on Friday in remarks reported by Agence France-Presse that the measures were “extreme.” “We would not have access to Manhattan  we would have to sleep in hotels at the airport  to be tested twice or three times per week ” he told Serbian media. “Also we could bring one person to the club  which is really impossible. I mean  you need your coach  then a fitness trainer  then a physiotherapist.” On Friday  Ross Hutchins  the chief tour officer of the ATP  sent a message to agents and coaches explaining that  after hearing player input  the ATP would soon give feedback to the U.S.T.A. on its plan. The proposal includes moving the Western & Southern Open  a top-tier combined men’s and women’s tournament  from the Cincinnati suburbs to New York and playing it ahead of the U.S. Open. “Ultimately the decision on the U.S. Open lies with the U.S.T.A. ” Hutchins wrote. “However we have welcomed the continued positive discussions and collaborative approach with us in these particularly tough times.” It will be intriguing to see if the U.S.T.A. pushes ahead if the men’s megastars make it clear they will not participate. Despite the likely loss of all ticket revenue  the Open has proposed nearly the same prize money for singles as in 2019. “I applaud them for trying ” said Sam Duvall  president of Topnotch Management  which represents the Americans John Isner  Reilly Opelka and Alison Riske. “I do think the vast majority of players would want to do it. I would hate for a Grand Slam to not go on because a few high-profile players decide it doesn’t work for them.” Quarantine could be an issue if players are required to spend up to 14 days self-isolating upon arrival in the United States and then again after traveling to Europe for the French Open. Under existing measures  most citizens of countries outside of the European Union are not permitted to enter France. But Forget  like the U.S.T.A.’s leadership  knows that the landscape could look quite different come September. “Hopefully by the end of the year we can all have a glass of Champagne and say  ‘Phew  it was close but we have managed to save quite a few big tournaments ’” Forget said. “It’s really important the U.S. Open happens  and it’s really important Roland Garros happens.” Advertisement ,articles/sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/sports/tennis/us-open-2020-plans.html,Top International Players Uneasy on U.S. Open Plan as Decision Nears Advertisement Supported by The president of the United States Tennis Association said a decision on staging the Open must be made next week  but some top international players have reservations on the proposal. None None “We have less than a week to go  so we need to finally finalize what we will do ” said Patrick Galbraith  the president of the United States Tennis Association  as he presented the case for holding this year’s Open to more than 400 players and coaches on a videoconference call with the ATP  the men’s tour. The tennis tours have been shut down since mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic  and two Grand Slam events have been affected. Wimbledon was canceled for the first time since 1945 amid World War II  and the French Open was postponed from a late May start until late September. None Exceptional measures would include restricting players to a tournament hotel outside Manhattan  imposing a limit of one support team member per player  eliminating singles qualifying and reducing the doubles draws to 24 teams from the usual 64. “I know this isn’t ideal ” Eric Butorac  a former tour player who is the U.S.T.A.’s director of player relations  said on Wednesday’s call. “The 2019 Open was amazing. I wish we could run it back the same way. However  this is the world we are living in. We believe this is a good plan and believe it is good for the sport. It’s good for the tennis economy  creates jobs for you  for coaches  for commentators  for so many people. And most importantly  this plan keeps you safe.” None Djokovic  the world’s top-ranked men’s player  called the proposed measures “extreme” in recent interviews with news media in his native Serbia and criticized the limit on the size of personal teams as “impossible.” He said he favored restarting the season in September at European clay-court events  most likely in Madrid or Rome  before the rescheduled French Open. Halep  ranked No. 2 in women’s singles and already training on clay in Romania  her home country  took a similar tack in an email interview on Wednesday. “I definitely have strong concerns about going there with those conditions ” she said. “Not only because we’re in the middle of a global pandemic but also because of the risk of travel  potential quarantine and then the changes around the tournament. “We are used to things operating very differently and it would not be an easy transition at all  particularly on our bodies. I know that financially the tournament and sponsors would like it to run and also that many players are out of jobs right now  but I think it’s a very personal decision we have to make. It’s important to understand that everyone has individual needs and circumstances and we should do what’s best for our personal health and also think long term about our career.” Butorac said players should not be concerned about having to self-quarantine upon arrival in the United States. “By the time we get to our event  we’re hearing our country will be opened up ” he said. But Wednesday’s conference call made it clear that some lower-ranked international players do share some of the stars’ concerns about health and travel. There are also concerns about fairness  with the qualifying tournament very likely eliminated and full singles ranking points still expected to be on offer if the U.S. Open goes ahead  even without some of the game’s biggest stars. Some on Wednesday’s call  including Kei Nishikori of Japan  proposed removing ranking points from the U.S. Open this year: a concept the U.S.T.A. is rejecting because it would transform the Open into a high-priced exhibition and potentially affect lucrative agreements with broadcasters like ESPN. The U.S.T.A. has also proposed moving the Western & Southern Open  a men’s and women’s event usually held outside Cincinnati  to New York for this year only and staging it without spectators at the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. The move would provide a warm-up tournament for the Open without making international players travel within the United States. With players not having competed since March  this doubleheader would allow them a chance to play meaningful matches before the U.S. Open  where the men’s singles matches are best of five sets. Combined prize money for the men for the two tournaments would be $30 million  according to Stacey Allaster  chief executive of the U.S.T.A.’s professional tennis division and the new U.S. Open tournament director. Allaster said $2 million of the U.S. Open total would be set aside as compensation for players who would be affected by the reduced doubles draw and lack of qualifying tournament. She said the U.S.T.A. would give discretion to Andrea Gaudenzi  the chairman of the ATP Tour  and his team on deploying those funds  suggesting they could be used to organize tournaments in Europe or compensate players directly. Because the U.S.T.A. does not own the Western & Southern women’s event  combined prize money was not yet clear. But the U.S.T.A.  cognizant of player concerns also has proposed a Plan B: canceling the Western & Southern Open and instead holding the U.S. Open with qualifying events and a full 64-team doubles draw. Galbraith said the U.S.T.A. could not put on full versions of both tournaments  adding that if the Western & Southern Open was dropped  men’s compensation for the U.S. Open alone would be “roughly $26 million” (the women would receive the same). That is approximately 95 percent of the 2019 total. When Marin Cilic of Croatia  the 2014 U.S. Open men’s singles champion  suggested that players should receive more prize money given the proposed conditions  Galbraith disagreed. “We actually are taking out more debt to get this event going ” Galbraith said. “Our revenues are absolutely shattered this year. We just had a cut on Monday of our staff. We laid off 130 people  so we can’t go any higher. We literally can’t. This is it.” The U.S.T.A. has rejected the option of trying to move the tournament outside of New York  although the U.S.T.A. has a campus with 100 courts in Orlando  Fla.  the area that is preparing to host the N.B.A. and Major League Soccer this summer. “We have a third scenario  and that is we pack it up and just cancel for 2020  which we really don’t want to do ” Galbraith said. If the U.S.T.A. does pursue the New York option  the plan will need approval from local and state authorities. Olivia Lapeyrolerie  a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio  said a team of experts from the parks department and the office of citywide events was working with the U.S.T.A. and evaluating its plans. “Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of New Yorkers ” she said. In addition  Steven Cohen and Bill Mulrow  two advisers to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo  are overseeing the process  creating the potential for the tournament to become another point of conflict in the long-running rivalry between Cuomo and de Blasio. Galbraith said a decision needed to be made by next week. The U.S.T.A. does not require approval from the men’s and women’s tours to go ahead with the U.S. Open  but Wednesday’s meeting made it clear that they are highly unlikely to get a full-strength field. That does not sit well with some players  including Danielle Collins  an American ranked 51st on the WTA Tour who was an Australian Open semifinalist in 2019. She was particularly critical of Djokovic  the president of the ATP Player Council. “He is one of the most influential players of our time  and his reluctance to play could determine whether or not the U.S. Open goes ahead ” she said in an email. “His incredible accomplishments and being the greatest player in the world has given him privileges like having a full staff to support him. The majority of players do not have this luxury.” Collins said that many players wanted to play and that if strict health and safety protocols were enforced  she would feel “pretty confident” about participating. “I think it’s important for top players to take a step back and realize that in the grand scheme of things we have it pretty good ” she said. “Everyone else is also making sacrifices  losing their jobs  having to find child care for their children who can’t go to school  etc. If the biggest sacrifice I will have to make in order to get tennis back up and going is only bringing one guest to the site  then I will consider myself very fortunate.” Matthew Futterman contributed reporting.
