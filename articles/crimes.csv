Is this based on the Oakland County Child Killer case   a man asked me holding up a copy of my novel  The End of Everything.   In 1994 my first year out of college I began writing what I hoped would become my first novel  the story of a 13 year old girl Lizzie whose best friend disappears from their suburban neighborhood. I managed only 40 or 50 pages before abandoning it. Yet the idea lingered with me. More than 15 years and four novels later I returned to that original file and began again. The result became  The End of Everything.  Despite an initial plan to set the story in the present day my instincts kept drawing me toward the hazy suburbia of my childhood in the late ’70s and early ’80s a world before cellphones and home computers before Amber Alerts and Megan’s Law. After her friend goes missing my narrator Lizzie’s placid suburb feels newly poisonous. Recess is canceled. Dark and lurid rumors buzz behind curled hands. Children are stiffly chaperoned to and from school.  The streets look so empty like it’s Christmas   Lizzie tells us waiting anxiously for her brother to pick her up.  All those packs of raucous kids gone all that rabid energy. I picture all of them in their family rooms their dens staring at TV screens their parents lurking in the door frame standing guard.  As I tried to conjure an atmosphere of fear and paranoia I kept experiencing an uncanny feeling of having been here before. It all felt so familiar calling to mind persistent feelings I’d had as a child — of crouching menace mysterious threats that could not be named of nervous parents and a general aura of dread. I started recalling long forgotten school assemblies focused on  strangers  in cars in vans lurking on the edge of schoolyards waiting. Whispers or allusions to  white slavery   child pornography networks — worse the whiff of molestation. That feeling that atmosphere of dread feels eerily reminiscent of our current moment. Lately as I see my neighbors’ kids in their masks their faces hidden I find myself wondering what today’s pandemic will mean for children in the months and years to come. The fear I felt as a child was real but ultimately misplaced. But today the fear is real and earned and everywhere. And so is the danger. Back then it all found its way into the book.  A witness came forward in the King case saying she saw a boy she believed to be Timothy talking to a man about 25 to 35 years old with shaggy hair and sideburns and driving a blue AMC Gremlin with white striping. About 20 000 tips came in and though strong suspects have emerged over the years the case remains open. It seems impossible that I had never read or heard about a series of crimes that received extensive local and even national media attention and occurred less than 15 miles from my childhood home — four children just a handful of years older than me abducted on a walk to the 7 Eleven or a bike ride to the local hobby store. At the Borders event I had fumbled with the man’s question explaining that I wasn’t familiar with the case. Besides my novel was about a single kidnapping not multiple murders. But afterward a former classmate approached me.  You really don’t remember   she said.  But how about the signs in the window and all that   It all came back. Of course I remembered the signs  white cardboard placards that parents could place in their front windows — a fluorescent orange  E  for emergency — that were meant to indicate it was a safe house. If someone was following us if someone was trying to interfere with us we should run into the nearest house with the  E  sign.  The logic of this continues to baffle me. If one wanted to harm a child wouldn’t the first thing they would do is put one of those signs in their window   And even if I didn’t remember the murders themselves — I was only 4 when the first occurred — what I do recall vividly is the feeling that danger was always lurking just beyond the schoolyard one’s front lawn. Like the victims of the Oakland County killer we too might be approached by a stranger seeking to entice us with candy to lure us into a basement to take naughty pictures of us to do things too terrible to say aloud. The feeling that those signs in the window still summon in me — anxiety distrust paranoia dread — are central to my novels. But I’d seldom pondered the source. If asked I usually pointed to my early interest in true crime. I still remember at age 10 or so sneaking peeks inside a yellowing paperback of  Helter Skelter  at the used bookstore and finding myself transfixed. It led to a lifelong fascination with true crime in all its forms. But now I wonder if my precocious enthrallment with true crime was not the origin story but instead my earliest attempt to make sense of a fear and fascination that was already there. In recent years the mid ’70s through the mid ’80s have come to be characterized as the age of  Stranger Danger   a moral panic driven perhaps by a ’60s hangover reflecting Reagan era cultural fears of collapse of the family and decline in law and order. Throughout the culture — in movies and after school specials in school assemblies and increasingly in the national media — the message was clear  No child was safe. Molesters and murderers were waiting in every shadow.   When I asked my mother recently about her own recollections of the Oakland County Child Killer she said she didn’t remember much about the case.  It seemed far enough away   she said adding that this was before the completion of Interstate 696 which made driving much faster between Detroit’s east and west sides. It was in so many ways a different time. Your neighborhood even in the suburbs was your whole world. The next day however my mother remembered more recalling how when the dismissal bell rang she would come to meet my brother and me at the corner of our street a mere 150 feet from the schoolyard’s edge. As she said it I remembered too though I had never known the impetus. You never think your childhood is specific tethered in ways seen and unseen to its era shaped by its historical context. With these years of distance I can look back on my childhood and dismiss all those nebulous fears and the contagion of fear from parents to children from schools to the community. Behind the fear of  strangers  lay the fear of cultural change the perennial fear of difference — shameful and corrosive fears that we can all now dismiss disavow. I have one memory — very hazy — from early childhood that has never left me. It was likely a few years past the heat of the Oakland County killings because I was walking the block from school alone my mother no longer appearing at the schoolyard’s edge to retrieve me. The day was gray under the white sky of a Michigan winter. For reasons I don’t remember I was late and the schoolyard was empty. Until it wasn’t. Far off on the other side of the graveled expanse I spotted a stranger. He was a young man tall with long sideburns — like the Oakland County Child Killer — wearing glasses a sheepskin parka flapping open in the breeze. I remember how large he looked and strange. It was the way his body moved lurching slightly to one side. And how he was smiling as if he were saying hello. He was calling out to me a kind of taunt or something else. A noise he was making almost a squawk like a trapped bird. I remember arriving at home breathlessly. I remember that night my beloved dad who died last year brought home bear claws for dessert and I remember eating them with him over the wax paper and how safe I felt how protected. Nothing could hurt me or my loved ones. I remember that feeling and wonder how you ever get it back. Megan Abbott is the author of nine books including most recently  Give Me Your Hand  and  Dare Me   which was adapted into a TV series. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/upshot/murders-rising-crime-coronavirus.html,It’s Been ‘Such a Weird Year.’ That’s Also Reflected in Crime Statistics., In large cities across America murders are up sharply while other violent crimes have decreased.  The national numbers for murder and other types of violent crime rarely move in opposite directions. But this is no ordinary year. Overall crime is down 5.3 percent in 25 large American cities relative to the same period in 2019 with violent crime down 2 percent. But murder in these 25 cities is up 16.1 percent in relation to last year. It’s not just a handful of cities driving this change either. Property crime is down in 18 of the 25 sampled cities and violent crime is down in 11 of them but murder is up in 20 of the cities.    An additional 11 cities provide year to date murder data. Murder is up 21.8 percent in all 36 cities with 2020 data through at least May with 29 of those cities seeing an increase this year relative to last year. How often do murder and other types of violent crime move in opposite directions  There have been only four years since 1960  1993 2000 2002 and 2003  when murder increased but overall violent crime decreased nationally and the increase in murder was small in each of those years. The average absolute difference between the national change in murder and violent crime since 1990 has been just 2.2 percent so a big increase in murder nationally while violent crime falls is almost unheard of. But this year has been distinct in many ways because of the pandemic and because of the protests and civil unrest after the death of George Floyd in police custody.  Identifying the trend in murder statistics is relatively easy. Understanding why it is happening and what can be done about it is much harder.    If that is one of the causes then we might see those tensions ease as lockdowns are relieved   he said.  It’s plausible that the increase in murder this year might reflect a trend that began before the pandemic got underway. A review of the percent change in murder in 10 cities before coronavirus struck  generally defined as through February or March  and those cities’ most recent June update for the year so far shows a worse year to date percent change in eight of them suggesting that the trend may have accelerated over the last few months. Although the FBI reports murder clearance data that reporting is slow and often incomplete. Nearly 40 percent of the cases of murder in 2018 had an unknown cause according to FBI data and an implausibly low 131 murders were formally classified as domestic violence. This stands in sharp contrast to an analysis by the Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox that there were more than 2 200 intimate partner murders nationwide in 2017.    These numbers do not tell a story that supports any ideological side of the debate around policing   Mr Goff said.  What it supports at most is a need for rigorous curiosity about a vital issue.  Ms. Doleac also says it is too early to draw any firm conclusions   This is such a weird year in so many dimensions and it’s going to take us a while to figure out what caused any of these differences in crime. It is perfectly reasonable to think the first half of this year may not tell us what the rest of the year will look like.    The reality is that we just don’t know  what’s driving the change in murder Mr Goff said  and it’s not a straightforward process to figure it out.   ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/mugshot-san-francisco-police.html,The Mug Shot  a Crime Story Staple  Is Dropped by Some Newsrooms and Police, The San Francisco Police Department said it would no longer release mug shots because they reinforce racial biases joining a growing movement by newspapers and broadcasters to curtail their use. transcript So our policy our booking photo policy has been changed whereas it’s much more restrictive. It really prohibits the release of booking photos except for a couple of situations. If there is a danger or a threat to the community and a booking photo would warn the community of that danger. If we are looking for a person who is wanted and that booking photo will help bring closure to that issue or that person is at risk or a person is at risk and the booking photo will help resolve that situation. Short of that we won’t be releasing it immediately to the media or on our department social media sites. Our whole criminal justice system is based on innocent until proven guilty. And when a person gets arrested and a mug shot is released to the public or a picture or an image of people released — particularly nowadays where it can be on the internet for forever — oftentimes or sometimes anyway people are never convicted of those crimes. So that could have lasting effects on an individual’s prospects for employment and other opportunities.  For more than a century police departments and news organizations have worked together to disseminate photos of people after their arrest often bleary eyed and despondent sometimes defiant and smiling. It’s a practice as old as the mug shot itself  publicizing an unflattering close up of a person’s face and profile taken at one of the worst possible moments. And in some police departments and newsrooms across the country it may be on its way out. William Scott the San Francisco police chief announced on Wednesday that his department would no longer release mug shots of people who had been arrested unless there was an immediate public safety reason to do so.  Many newsrooms have already started removing mug shot galleries citing the same reasoning.    The decisions by those news organizations came after The Houston Chronicle announced in January that it would stop using the galleries a move that drew praise from a local sheriff’s office.    We say we are a society that believes in rehabilitation and second chances   she said in an email.  And publishing internet mug shots — of people who aren’t convicted and haven’t even had a first chance — was always at odds with that.  Police departments in the United States began taking photos of people they arrested in the 1850s.  It was not long before the images were displayed to the public in what became known as rogues’ galleries where people could visit police stations and look at photos of people who had been arrested. Almost immediately the practice was criticized by police reformers and reporters who questioned the ethics of forcing someone to sit for a photograph before there had been a trial Professor Tucker said. Critics also worried about the photos’ remaining on file even after a person had been found not guilty of a crime she added. Social scientists and eugenicists began using the photos to associate certain facial features with crime Professor Tucker said. The photographs began to feed  the false notion that it’s possible to read criminality on a person’s body   she said.   They’re using racial categories early on   she said.  They’re labeling someone an Irishman. You see that from the very beginning.  Releasing the pictures let people know they would be shamed publicly if they were arrested Professor Fleetwood said.  It’s also teaching the public to be part of police work   she said.  It tells them ‘Look out for these people.’   As technology improved in the 20th century the images were used more frequently in magazines and newspapers that before had relied on artists to engrave photos available at police stations.   But those photos disproportionately represented Black and Latino people who make up a minority of the city’s population she said.  If the only faces you’re seeing are of Black and Latino people it can create this illusion that most Black and Latino people are committing the crimes   said Professor Eberhardt who was among the academics reporters and criminal justice reform supporters with whom Chief Scott consulted before changing his department’s mug shot policy. She added  You fear the group not the individual.  ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/world/europe/hashim-thaci-kosovo-war-crimes.html,Kosovo President Is Indicted for War Crimes for Role in War With Serbia, President Hashim Thaci who was scheduled to visit the White House on Saturday faces 10 counts of war crimes brought by prosecutors at a special court in the Netherlands.    Mr Thaci 52 will no longer attend the meeting dashing American hopes that the negotiations might finally lead to a settlement between Serbia and Kosovo. Kosovo won autonomy in 1999 aided by a NATO bombing campaign but Serbia has never recognized Kosovo’s sovereignty and negotiations to reach a final peace deal stalled in 2018. The United States is one of about 100 countries that recognize Kosovo’s independence.  This affects Kosovo in all possible ways   said Agron Bajrami the head of the Koha Media Group Kosovo’s largest media conglomerate.  It affects the process of dialogue in which the president was the main interlocutor for both the European Union and the United States and it will have an enormous effect in the political scene in Kosovo.   Though investigators previously had summoned a sitting Kosovar prime minister to give evidence in The Hague Mr Thaci and his co defendants were among the first to be indicted by the prosecutors. The prosecutors accused Mr Thaci Kadri Veseli a former spy chief and several unnamed defendants of crimes against humanity including murder enforced disappearance of persons persecution and torture.  If the indictment is confirmed it would be unprecedented   said Vigan Qorrolli a law professor at the University of Pristina in Kosovo’s capital.  Some people thought they’d go for the smaller fishes but they started with the bigger fishes.  Mr Thaci began his public life as a leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army but turned to civilian politics after the war ended serving as both prime minister and foreign minister. Since 2016 he has been Kosovo’s mainly ceremonial president. Mr Thaci remains one of the pillars of Kosovar political life revered as a hero of the war by some while others accuse him of being the embodiment of the wayward political class that has ruled Kosovo since its independence from Serbia.     Prosecutors at the special court said they had been forced into announcing their indictment on Wednesday because of actions taken by Mr Thaci and Mr Veseli to undermine their work accusing him of  a secret campaign to overturn the law creating the Court.  A spokesman for the prosecutors declined to elaborate. A spokesman for Mr Thaci also declined to comment. Patrick Kingsley reported from Berlin and Gerry Mullany from New York.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/nyregion/murders-nyc-guns-crime.html,64 Shot  10 Dead: Spike in Gun Violence Alarms an On-Edge N.Y.C., The victims included a young father who was shot while holding hands with his 6 year old daughter in the Bronx.  A young father crossing a Bronx street holding hands with his 6 year old daughter. A 15 year old who refused to talk to the police in Manhattan. A man in a Staten Island public housing complex found prone in his apartment. They were among 64 people shot in a surge of shootings over the weekend in New York City the police said. Ten of those shot lost their lives including the young father and the Staten Island man — a wave of summertime violence that has given renewed urgency to a gun violence crisis that had been overshadowed this year by the coronavirus pandemic and by unrest over police racism and brutality. The city surpassed 400 shootings in the first half of the year for the first time since 2016 with 528 by the end of last month the 205 shootings in June were the highest for that month since 1996 the police said.  Still the surge in shootings has caused alarm in the city and has appeared to create a rift between Mayor Bill de Blasio and senior police officials as to its cause.  This is something that we have to double down on   Mr de Blasio said at a news conference on Monday adding that the rise in shootings was fueled by several factors but mainly the  dislocation that has happened over these last four months with the coronavirus.   The fact that the court system is not working the economy is not working people have been penned up for months and months so many issues underlying this challenge   he said. But senior police officials have attributed the rise in violence to criminal justice reforms put in place over the last few years by lawmakers and prosecutors. Those changes which include efforts by the mayor’s office to reduce the population of the Rikers Island jail complex have put more violent criminals back on the street and erased deterrents and consequences for carrying guns and shooting them the police have argued.  When you take basically half the population of Rikers Island and put it onto the street and then wonder what’s going on it’s dumbfounding to me   the police commissioner Dermot F. Shea said during a radio interview on 1010 WINS on Monday alluding to the number of inmates released from the city’s jails during the pandemic. The commissioner directed his ire at people who he said  think they know more about law enforcement  than the police and cited a chokehold bill passed by the City Council that makes it a crime for officers to put their knees into someone’s back during an arrest. He said officers need more resources public support and laws that help them fight crime rather than constraining them.  Chief Kathleen O’Reilly of Manhattan North wrote on Twitter that it was  disgraceful  how many people had been shot over a 24 hour period and asked where were the elected officials and violence interrupters.  The community is suffering   she said. Danny Frost a spokesman for the district attorney said it has been the office’s policy for decades to have assistant district attorneys respond to crime scenes provide regular briefings to the district attorney and work with supervisors and the police to move cases forward.  It is unclear what the Manhattan district attorney could substantively contribute at a crime scene   he said.  Rory Lancman the chairman of the City Council’s committee on the justice system and the sponsor of the chokehold bill said the police were grasping at everything they could to fight systemic changes from the outside. Chokeholds are already banned by the department he noted and the Council law has not yet taken effect. The police commissioner  has been desperately looking anywhere but the mirror  to explain the rise in major crimes and shootings he said.  It’s not serious and if he cannot competently and safely keep New Yorkers safe while adhering to the very same chokehold and knee restraints that are in the patrol guide then it is definitely time for a new commissioner.  Donovan Richards the chairman of the City Council’s public safety committee said that it is the job of the police to fight crime and he said that the department appeared to be doing the opposite of what was needed to counter calls to cut its budget and head count.  There’s a slowdown without a doubt and N.Y.P.D. is allowing it   he said in an interview.  We’ve seen what the N.Y.P.D. will do when they want to keep record low shootings over the course of the last few years. Every year we’re breaking this record we’re breaking this record. There’s not even an effort being made at this point.  Chief of Department Terence A. Monahan the police department’s top uniformed official denied there was a slowdown. John Eterno a Molloy College professor and former city police captain said there appeared to be a real and significant increase in shootings that is connected to officers’ sinking morale given the barrage of criticism from politicians and the public.  Many people have the idea that police feel very powerful with their badge and gun and it’s the opposite   he said.  So when you see a lack of support from a lot of places not just from the community but also from politicians I do think police do change their job and how they do it.  He also cited the failure to devise effective policing strategies to replace those that have been curtailed like street stops or eliminated like precinct anti crime units.  Police released video of that shooting on Sunday that showed the young father Anthony Robinson 29 crossing a street in the Claremont neighborhood with his daughter before a car pulled up alongside him. A man in the front seat pointed a gun out of the passenger window and pulled the trigger and Mr Robinson collapsed on the pavement. His cousin Michael Robinson said the father and daughter were headed to the subway station to return to Brooklyn after celebrating Independence Day in the Bronx. The girl he said was  a daddy’s girl literally attached to his hip.   Jeffery C. Mays and Mihir Zaveri contributed reporting. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/world/asia/china-xinjiang-uighur-court.html,Uighur Exiles Push for Court Case Accusing China of Genocide, The complaint at the International Criminal Court is the first of its kind to challenge Beijing on its crackdown on Muslims but China does not accept the court’s jurisdiction.  Uighur exiles urged the International Criminal Court on Monday to investigate Beijing for genocide and crimes against humanity the first ever attempt to use international law to hold China’s ruling Communist Party accountable for its draconian crackdown on the Muslim minority. A team of London based lawyers representing two Uighur activist groups has filed a complaint against Beijing for pursuing the repatriation of thousands of Uighurs through unlawful arrests in or deportation from Cambodia and Tajikistan. The case could bring greater international scrutiny of the Chinese state’s power to impose its will beyond its borders. The lawyers’ 80 page filing includes a list of more than 30 Chinese officials they said were responsible for the campaign including Xi Jinping the Communist Party leader.  The court’s mandate is to seek justice for victims of genocide war crimes and other atrocities. But China does not recognize its jurisdiction raising the question of how far the case will go.   This can become a critical case because for so long it has been assumed that nothing could be done to hold China accountable at an international court   Mr Dixon said by telephone from London before traveling to The Hague. Citing a 2018 ruling by the court Mr Dixon said  The court has said it has jurisdiction when crimes start or end in a member state and that is the case here.    Their complaint also broadly takes aim at China’s policies in Xinjiang over the past decade and the imposition of increasingly harsh security measures following a spate of violent unrest. The Uighurs have long resented the tight controls imposed by the authorities on their religion and culture and the influx of Han Chinese the majority ethnic group in China into Xinjiang. Under Mr Xi the Xinjiang government expanded efforts to cajole pressure or force Uighurs to return from abroad and also established the internment camps intended to indoctrinate Uighurs to turn away from religion and embrace Chinese rule. It has imposed programs pushing minorities into jobs as factory workers and street cleaners.  Mr Dixon the British lawyer said the complaint against Beijing included evidence of forced deportations and extraterritorial arrests by Chinese agents gathered from witnesses and victims reports from the United Nations and organizations such as Amnesty International and exile groups.  The prosecutor needs to investigate genocide   Mr Dixon said.  If you capture people and you have a campaign to suppress them and you sterilize them it is a campaign which intends to dilute and destroy their identity as a group.  It may take months before the international court’s chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda of Gambia issues a formal response to the lawyers’ filing. China’s foreign ministry had no immediate comment on the complaint. But the Chinese government has repeatedly rejected the evidence of widespread repression of minorities in Xinjiang.  China’s response to the filing may mirror that of the Trump administration in cases that have involved Americans. The administration has fiercely attacked the international court for initiating an investigation of possible war crimes by American and Afghan forces in Afghanistan. Last month Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described it as  a kangaroo court   and President Trump called for economic penalties and travel restrictions to be imposed on court employees participating in investigations of Americans.

Mary Kay Letourneau a one time teacher who became a tabloid fixture in the late 1990s after she raped a 13 year old student and later married him after serving a prison sentence died on Monday near Seattle. She was 58. Her lawyer David Gehrke said she died of cancer. He said she had died at home surrounded by her children and Vili Fualaau the former student she later married. Ms. Letourneau and Mr Fualaau had two children together before he turned 15. They both defended the relationship as consensual and the couple married in 2005 after she had served a seven year prison term. She was widely condemned for her predatory behavior toward the child but many people long held a fascination with their relationship which continued well into Mr Fualaau’s adulthood. The couple split in 2019. Ms. Letourneau was a teacher in the Highline School District near Seattle where she taught Mr Fualaau in the second and sixth grades. She was 34 when she began a sexual relationship with Mr Fualaau in 1996 when he was 12 or 13. They had their first child in 1997 as she awaited sentencing after pleading guilty to charges of second degree child rape. After serving three months of a reduced sentence in prison she defied court orders to stay away from Mr Fualaau leading to her return to prison for a seven year sentence. She gave birth to their second child in 1998 shortly after beginning her second stint in prison. That year they co wrote a book they titled  Un Seul Crime L’Amour   or  Only One Crime Love.  Mr Fualaau has maintained in recent years that he did not consider her abusive. Upon her release from prison in 2004 Ms. Letourneau was required to have no contact with Mr Fualaau then 21. But he fought to have the order removed and the couple married in 2005. She had consistently portrayed the relationship as a forbidden love.  Ms. Letourneau born in Tustin Calif. attended Arizona State University where she met Steve Letourneau her first husband. The couple had four children together and divorced in 1999 while she was in prison. Her father John Schmitz was an ultraconservative US representative who ran for president in 1972 as a member of the American Independent Party. One of her brothers Joseph E. Schmitz was the inspector general of the Department of Defense an executive at Blackwater Worldwide and a one time foreign policy adviser for President Trump. Another brother John P. Schmitz was a deputy counsel to President George H. W. Bush. Anne Bremner a lawyer who was a friend of Ms. Letourneau for nearly 20 years said that as she neared death Ms. Letourneau hoped that people would be able to see her as someone who had served her time and gone on to raise two daughters with Mr Fualaau and to have a positive impact on the people around her.  She was always a really good person   Ms. Bremner said.  She was always a really good friend.  Mr Fualaau said in the A E documentary that  at the end of the day it was a real love story.  But he added   A lot of things that should have gone through my mind at the time weren’t going through my mind.  Mike Baker contributed reporting. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/us/politics/international-criminal-court-troops-trump.html,U.S. to Penalize War Crimes Investigators Looking Into American Troops, The International Criminal Court has collected evidence of what it says is torture rape and other crimes by American forces during the war in Afghanistan.  WASHINGTON — International investigators looking into charges of war crimes by Americans in Afghanistan will face economic penalties and travel restrictions the Trump administration warned on Thursday accusing a Hague based court of corruption and maintaining that the United States can prosecute its own military and intelligence personnel. The sanctions come more than two years after the International Criminal Court announced an inquiry into allegations of crimes against humanity — including torture and rape — by US forces in Afghanistan and at CIA interrogation facilities abroad. President Trump ordered the new penalties on Wednesday and dispatched four of his most senior advisers to announce them on Thursday as a rebuke to what the administration described as an affront to American sovereignty despite the risk of appearing to dismiss attention to possible human rights abuses.  When our own people do wrong we lawfully punish those individuals as rare as they are who tarnish the reputation of our great US military and our intelligence services   said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who was flanked at the State Department by Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper Attorney General William P. Barr and Robert C. O’Brien the White House national security adviser.  We hold our own accountable better than the I.C.C. has done for the worst perpetrators of mass criminal atrocities   Mr Pompeo said. The court called the new restrictions  an escalation and an unacceptable attempt to interfere with the rule of law and the court’s judicial proceedings.   They are announced with the declared aim of influencing the actions of I.C.C. officials in the context of the court’s independent and objective investigations and impartial judicial proceedings   the court said a statement.  An attack on the I.C.C. also represents an attack against the interests of victims of atrocity crimes for many of whom the court represents the last hope for justice.  Leaders of the American military and the intelligence community have struggled with accusations of battlefield and detainee abuse in the two decades since the Sept. 11 attacks after US troops invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. Both wars strained American credibility around the world stretching the ability of US troops to deploy to combat year after year.  The United States is not a signer to the international court which went into effect in 2002 to investigate crimes against humanity and genocide and is based in The Hague in the Netherlands. But Washington has cooperated with the court on past cases and American citizens can be subject to its jurisdiction in investigations of crimes that are committed in countries that have joined. Afghanistan is a party to the court but its government has objected to the inquiry as Afghan officials independently investigate possible war crimes. Poland Romania and Lithuania are also member states.    Richard Dicker the international justice director at Human Rights Watch said the Trump administration was  putting the US on the side of those who commit and cover up human rights abuses not those who prosecute them.   Asset freezes and travel bans are for human rights violators not prosecutors and judges seeking to bring justice for victims of serious abuses   Mr Dicker said after the new penalties were announced. Another critic William W. Burke White a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania predicted that the sanctions and visa restrictions would not stop the international court’s investigation. Instead he said the penalties  may undermine one of the most powerful tools in the US foreign policy arsenal.   The Trump administration has long reviled the court. Mr Trump’s previous national security adviser John R. Bolton who has been a fervent opponent of the legal body since 2002 delivered a fiery speech in September 2018 that first put the court on notice that it could be subject to American sanctions. The Clinton administration signed the treaty that established the court in 1998 but President George W. Bush later called it invalid and never sought to join it. The Obama administration cooperated with the court on some of its investigations including into human rights abuses in Darfur a region of Sudan but did not renew a push for American membership. At Thursday’s announcement Mr Barr said the court was vulnerable to manipulation by  foreign powers like Russia  but did not elaborate or give examples. Mr Pompeo castigated it as a  mockery.  He said the court had won only four convictions in major criminal cases since 2002 despite spending  1 billion and demanding hefty pay raises for its judges. Mr Pompeo said that reflected ineptitude and the  highly politicized nature  of a court that he said allowed hearsay as evidence failed to guarantee a speedy trial and denied accountability to the US legal system. He warned other allies that fought with American forces in Afghanistan that  your people could be next.     Both Mr Pompeo and Mr O’Brien made mention of their previous military service at Thursday’s announcement in vowing to protect American forces who had served in combat. Mr Esper is also a former Army officer.  Rest assured   Mr Esper said  that the men and women of the United States Armed Forces will never appear before the I.C.C.

PARIS — The police in Europe said Thursday they had arrested hundreds of people on suspicion of drug trafficking and other crimes after successfully hacking into an encrypted phone network being used by organized criminals around the world. The authorities said that by hacking into the network the police were able to monitor criminal activity and communication as it was happening allowing them to stop drug deals and even to prevent murder. Officials said in a statement that  millions  of messages were read in  real time over the shoulder of the unsuspecting senders   leading to arrests in the Netherlands the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe.  It was as though we were sitting at the table where the criminals were chatting among themselves really   said Jannine van den Berg chief constable of the central police unit in the Netherlands at a news conference in The Hague.  What makes this investigation unique is that at a large scale we managed to read all of these criminal messages live   she said. The phone network that was used known as EncroChat provided specially altered phones — no camera microphone or GPS — for about  1 100. The phones allowed users to immediately erase compromising messages. The network also provided subscriptions with global coverage for about  1 600 over six months even offering round the clock tech support. EncroChat since shut down  promised anonymity and complete secrecy to its users   said Carole Etienne a French prosecutor. The phones she added were  widely used throughout the world  by criminal organizations.  What seems to be possible only in thrillers and police shows we actually have seen happen   said Andy Kraag head of the central investigations division in the Netherlands which led the operation in collaboration with French authorities.  These messages that we captured give us a very detailed view of daily life in the criminal world   Mr Kraag said at the news conference.  We understand better who these people are and how they work.  Officials Thursday spoke in superlatives about the operation. The authorities had been monitoring the network for over two months before it was shut down said Tina Hollevoet a Europol spokeswoman. The data is still being analyzed and is expected to lead to  hundreds  of new investigations in the coming months.  What is really important for Europol is that we are kind of just getting started   Ms. Hollevoet said.  In this initial phase the focus has been really on acting on those messages which contain live threatening content and the crimes that were really endangering people’s lives. But we still have so much data that is being analyzed processed and transmitted to different countries.  The hacked messages and conversations were shared among the police in Europe through Europol. In Britain the police made nearly 750 arrests and seized  67 million in cash 77 firearms and over two tons of drugs. The information was also used by the police in Sweden and Norway leading to arrests in those countries as well. In the Netherlands the police were able to make some 60 arrests as a result of the intercepted messages and to seize 22 000 pounds of cocaine 154 pounds of heroin and 3 300 pounds of crystal methamphetamine among other substances. They also dismantled 19 synthetic drug labs seized 25 vehicles with  special compartments  and also  expensive watches   according to a statement from Europol. The hacking  allowed authorities to detect and stop potential criminal activities   said Ms. Etienne the French prosecutor.  More than 100 criminal acts were picked up by Europol.  The investigation into EncroChat began in 2017 and it was initially focused on Lille a city in the north of France where the authorities discovered the presence of EncroChat servers. On June 13 the network sent out a warning to its users that it had been  infiltrated  by  governmental entities   and advised customers to immediately get rid of their phones.  In many of our investigations but also in other European countries we were coming across a lot of criminals with EncroChat phones and after a while that caught our attention   said Maj. Gen. Jean Philippe Lecouffe of the French gendarmerie.  We realized that this network was used over 90 percent of the time by criminals to message each other and hide their communications from traditional police wiretapping techniques.  Ms. Hollevoet the Europol spokeswoman said the operation has provided deep insight into how organized crime functions and described the level of detail that law enforcement was able to monitor over EncroChat as  unprecedented.

On Monday in a converted ballroom in Sacramento the former police officer admitted his guilt. transcript  Do you understand Mr DeAngelo that you’ll be entering guilty pleas to 13 counts of murder in the first degree omitting special circumstances enhancements as well as admitting to uncharged acts. Do you understand that sir    Yes.   It’s anticipated that you will receive 11 consecutive life without the possibility of parole sentences with 15 concurrent life sentences additional time for weapon enhancements will be imposed as mandated by law. Do you understand that as well sir    Yes.   As a condition of this plea you will agree to waive any and all appellate rights. Do you understand the terms of this plea. Mr DeAngelo    Yes.   For decades a killer was on the loose in California terrorizing victims from the southern coast to the Central Valley to the Bay Area and the tidy subdivisions near Sacramento. As the years went by he bore his way into the state’s consciousness provoking manhunts and television shows and the obsessive sleuthing of amateur detectives. He went by many nicknames — East Area Rapist the Original Night Stalker the Visalia Ransacker — before a last one took hold  the Golden State Killer. The final accounting of his crime spree was 13 known murders and nearly 50 rapes. The crimes began in 1975 and the case finally reached its denouement on Monday in a hearing inside a ballroom at Sacramento State University that because of the pandemic was livestreamed. Joseph James DeAngelo 74 — no longer the agile young man who sneaked into women’s homes — had to be helped up when the judge entered the room. He wore an orange prison jumpsuit and a plastic face shield and was surrounded by district attorneys from several jurisdictions where he committed his crimes.  In front of victims and their families Amy Holliday the Sacramento County deputy district attorney announced the plea arrangement which took the death penalty off the table in exchange for guilty pleas that resulted in 11 consecutive life sentences. In addition she said he also agreed to admit guilt in a multitude of crimes for which he was not charged some of which had passed the statute of limitations. Throughout the hearing prosecutors from counties across California approached the podium and described a series of murders rapes and burglaries in detail. Michael G. Bowman a judge for the Sacramento County Superior Court then asked Mr DeAngelo for his plea.  Guilty   Mr DeAngelo said after each one. The judge then asked whether he admitted the circumstances of the crime.  I admit   he said over and over. Asked by the judge if he understood he would receive 11 consecutive life sentences without parole Mr DeAngelo said  yes.  The hearing was held in the ballroom in part to accommodate in person attendance amid the coronavirus pandemic. Mr DeAngelo and his lawyers wore transparent face shields. After speaking Judge Bowman put on a black face mask. The prosecutors’ decision to take a plea deal rather than go to a jury trial was driven in part by public health risks Ms. Holliday said at the start. The preliminary hearing was originally scheduled for May she said but  it had to be postponed because of court closures and the dangers of bringing elderly or high risk individuals into the courtroom.  The advanced age of many of the key players involved also played a role.  Many of the victims witnesses and law enforcement are in their 80s and 90s   she said.  Many of these people all deeply affected by these crimes may not be with us at the time of jury trial.  Mr DeAngelo had eluded the authorities for four decades before he was arrested in 2018 in a Sacramento suburb.   But as the technique has become increasingly commonplace genealogists legal scholars and some legislators have voiced concerns that this revolutionary approach is violating the privacy of the people who join DNA databases to learn about themselves — not to help the police arrest their relatives for violent crimes. The fact that the approach remains largely unregulated even as law enforcement has begun applying the technique to increasingly minor crimes — such a burglary — has only fueled criticism. District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert of Sacramento County who played a key role in encouraging the use of genetic genealogy in this case said Monday’s developments reinforce why it was merited.  This has been a long journey for justice for countless victims and their families   she said.  The facts revealed today demonstrate that Joseph DeAngelo is a sociopath master manipulator and a sadistic serial killer.  But Elizabeth Joh a law professor at the University of California Davis said the horrifying nature of his crimes should not obscure the need for more thorough regulation of the technique.  The resolution of the Golden State Killer case should be lauded for bringing closure to these investigations but the means by which DeAngelo was identified remains troubling   she said. The crimes associated with the man who would become known as the Golden State Killer began in the mid 1970s and by 1977 after a series of horrifying rapes of women in their homes in Sacramento County he was nicknamed the East Area Rapist. The community held packed public forums to discuss the cases that seemed to be occurring once every month.  The fear in the community was like something I had never seen before   Carol Daly a former Sacramento sheriff’s detective told The New York Times in 2018 after Mr DeAngelo was arrested.  People were afraid wherever they went.  Mr DeAngelo working as a police officer at the time soon moved from rape to murder killing a married couple Brian and Katie Maggiore while they were walking their dog in the city of Rancho Cordova in 1978. But in 1986 the crime wave suddenly stopped leading to decades of speculation. Had the killer died  Had he moved to another state  It turns out he settled into a quiet life in the Sacramento suburbs — working at a Save Mart grocery store in Roseville — where he was eventually captured in 2018. As part of the plea deal Mr DeAngelo will avoid the death penalty a decision that has produced mixed feelings among some victims and their families who are eager to see this chapter closed but also want to see a man who terrorized so many forced to confront the allegations. Gay Hardwick who was raped in 1978 while her now husband Bob Hardwick was tied up was among the audience members who sat in carefully distanced groups.  I already feel relieved   she said.  He’s going away and never coming out and there won’t be any appeals. He will die in prison.   In recent months some victims’ family members have expressed doubts that Mr DeAngelo is as frail as he acts in court appearances and that he truly requires a wheelchair. Asked about those concerns in a news conference Ms. Schubert noted that a couple of days before he was arrested Mr DeAngelo was racing down the freeway on his motorcycle.  I think those victims know exactly what is going on in Mr DeAngelo’s head   she said. Prosecutors also said the plea deal did not provide any additional insight about why the  real life version of Hannibal Lecter   as Ms. Schubert called him would stop committing crimes in his 40s — if he truly did. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/politics/senate-police-bill.html,Senate Democrats Block G.O.P. Police Bill  Calling It Inadequate, The vote reflected the waning likelihood that Congress would be able to reach an election year compromise on legislation to address racial bias in policing.    Expressing their deep opposition to the bill Democrats demanded on Tuesday that Republicans negotiate a more expansive package that both parties could support citing the opposition of dozens of civil rights groups to the measure as drafted and arguing that it was an unacceptable starting point for discussion. Senator Kamala Harris Democrat of California told reporters that Democrats’ decision to block the bill was an effort  to not take crumbs on the table when there is a hunger that America has for real solutions to a very real problem.   This movement will not accept anything less than real real substantial substantive solutions which are the solutions we have offered   Ms. Harris said. Republicans were livid at Democrats’ refusal to even allow the measure to reach the floor for a debate and accused them of deliberately sinking the bill for political purposes. It would have needed 60 votes to advance in the Senate where a three fifths supermajority is necessary for most major action. But only two Democrats Senators Doug Jones of Alabama and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia as well as Senator Angus King independent of Maine joined Republicans in supporting moving it forward.   This is an opportunity to say yes   he said. After the measure failed a visibly frustrated Mr Scott returned and delivered extended remarks saying that he had offered to give Democrats as many as 20 votes on proposed modifications to his bill that they were demanding but that they had refused to accept. Privately Democrats noted that revising the bill would have also required the approval of 60 senators a threshold they feared they would not be able to meet.  Instead of going forward and getting what you want now they’ve decided to punt this ball until the election   Mr Scott said of Democrats.  You know why  Because they believe the polls reflect a 15 point deficit on our side therefore they can get the bill they want in November.   The actual problem is not what is being offered it is who is offering it   he continued. As Mr Scott left the floor senators who had gathered there to hear him speak stood to applaud him. One of them Senator Tim Kaine Democrat of Virginia who said he had come to listen to Mr Scott in appreciation of his work launched into his own impassioned speech denying that the outcome had been politically driven.  That is a stiff charge   Mr Kaine said.  I voted not on the ‘what’ and not on the ‘who.’ I voted on the ‘how.’ We tried it the wrong way. Let’s try it the right way.    Wednesday’s vote did not foreclose the possibility of reviving the policing measure. Senator Mitch McConnell Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader used a procedural maneuver that would allow him to bring it up again in the future changing his vote from  yes  to  no  so he could later call for its reconsideration. But a flurry of private bipartisan talks to strike a deal on the issue had not borne fruit. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/politics/qualified-immunity.html,Qualified Immunity Protection for Police Emerges as Flash Point Amid Protests, The Supreme Court developed the doctrine that serves as a shield for officers. A half century later it is at the center of the debate over policing.   A police officer saw Mr Jones walking illegally in the road that night in 2013 and asked whether he was carrying a weapon. Mr Jones who had a small knife and the police got into a tussle after which one officer accused Mr Jones of stabbing him. Fifteen minutes later Mr Jones lay on the ground facedown between a stone wall and five officers who had fired 22 bullets at his backside. Mr Jones’s brothers Robert and Bruce have tried for years to hold the police accountable for Wayne’s death but have repeatedly run into hurdles  Most recently the officers claimed they could not be held liable under so called qualified immunity an esoteric legal doctrine invoked by police departments across the country for decades in response to allegations of excessive force. It provides legal protections for officers when they are accused of violating others’ constitutional rights. Once a little known rule qualified immunity has emerged as a flash point in the protests spurred by Mr Floyd’s killing and galvanized calls for police reform. In the vast majority of cases of police brutality officers are never criminally prosecuted. For families of victims seeking some sort of relief through the justice system qualified immunity presents another obstacle to obtaining financial or other damages. Even in the rare cases where the officers are charged as in Mr Floyd’s death the police can still claim qualified immunity if relatives or victims sue them.  Every time across the country that I hear of a new case I see a news report of another victim it just opens up the wounds again   Robert Jones said.  It makes it feel like it just happened yesterday.  Activists have seized on qualified immunity as what they see as one of the biggest problems with policing and argued that it shields officers from being held accountable in cases of misconduct. Police leaders said it was essential for officers’ ability to respond to calls and to make split second decisions.  State legislatures have taken up the issue as well. The Colorado General Assembly became the first to eliminate qualified immunity this month.  It’s a message that’s sent in these cases — that officers can violate people’s rights with impunity   said Joanna Schwartz a professor of law at the University of California Los Angeles who has written extensively on the doctrine.  That is outrageous to people and causing people to act.  In 1967 amid another era marked by civil rights protests the Supreme Court introduced qualified immunity to protect government officials acting in good faith — not just police officers — from financial liability. In a case involving clergy members who said they were wrongfully arrested on charges of breach of peace for entering a whites only bus terminal waiting room the justices argued that if officers were personally held responsible for their misconduct it might deter them from performing their duties and making arrests. The court expanded the protection in ensuing decades and it now covers  all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law   a rationale offered by the Supreme Court in 1986 in an unlawful arrest case. As a result victims and families accusing police officers of brutality must find a virtually identical case where officers were held responsible to cite as precedent in cases where officers claim qualified immunity. Since Mr Brown’s shooting death by a white officer in 2014 and protests over it prompted a national conversation about racism and police brutality both liberal and conservative justices have expressed doubts about the doctrine. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in 2018 that the doctrine  tells officers that they can shoot first and think later and it tells the public that palpably unreasonable conduct will go unpunished.   Critics have accused the court of arbitrarily contriving it. At a House Judiciary Committee hearing last week Representative Jerrold R. Nadler Democrat of New York and the committee chairman said that before qualified immunity was  invented  by the Supreme Court  the world did not fall in.  David Cole the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union which filed one of the petitions rejected by the Supreme Court last week called the doctrine  a free pass  for police officers  to violate constitutional rights without being held to account.  Though the doctrine is intended to protect officers from paying for the damages they cause he said the result is that officers are more likely to abuse their powers.  Fiscal concerns are overriding concerns about justice and police accountability   Mr Cole added. Advocates on behalf of the police insisted that qualified immunity was necessary for officers to protect the public. Its protections allow officers to make life or death decisions in a matter of seconds they said and without it fewer people might be willing to join police forces.    The proponents looking at qualified immunity are kind of cynically taking advantage of a horrific situation to change the law in a different area that does not apply to that area at all   Mr Johnson said.  In the vast majority of cases where officers are not charged victims can pursue justice only in the form of financial or other damages through lawsuits. Qualified immunity can block them from obtaining relief.  Senator Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee did signal an openness to revisiting the doctrine at a committee meeting last week.  Maybe there’s something we can do with the concept of qualified immunity that would put more accountability into the agencies that run police departments   he suggested. Another Republican senator Mike Braun of Indiana introduced legislation Tuesday that would change how qualified immunity was applied. Under his proposal officers could claim the protection only under two conditions  when their conduct had been legally authorized or required or if a court found that it did not violate the Constitution or federal laws.  Mr Jones’s relatives are awaiting a decision from the West Virginia Supreme Court about whether they are entitled to see secret testimony given to the grand jury that voted not to indict the officers and whether they are entitled to a new grand jury altogether to investigate the case anew. Seven years later Quakers and other groups in the area host monthly vigils for Mr Jones. And for his brother Robert the feeling of loss is still fresh. He never watched the footage of his brother’s killing in full but he mustered up the courage to watch the final minutes of Mr Floyd’s life. It brought him to tears and he said that protections for officers like qualified immunity are to blame in the deaths.  It’s like a thief   he said.  If you keep letting the thief get away with it he’s going to keep on doing it. If you keep letting these people kill and harass and hurt people they’re going to keep on doing it.  ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/politics/congress-police-reform-senate.html,Senate Democrats Plan to Block G.O.P. Police Bill  Stalling Overhaul, Calling Republicans’ legislation  woefully inadequate   Democrats urged Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader to negotiate a new more expansive bill both parties could support.  WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats said on Tuesday that they would block Republicans’ attempts to advance a narrow bill to encourage police departments to revise their practices rejecting the measure as  woefully inadequate  and setting up a clash that could mark the death of a fledgling congressional effort to address racial bias in law enforcement.    No bill will pass as a result of this ploy by Senator McConnell   Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the minority leader said on the Senate floor referring to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the majority leader. Mr Schumer implored Republicans to negotiate a more expansive bill that both parties could support.  The Republican majority has given the Senate a bad bill and proposed no credible way to sufficiently improve it   he said.     Republicans were furious on Tuesday at Democrats’ refusal to advance the measure and accused them of deliberately creating a logjam for political purposes rather than trying to find a way to enact meaningful change.  If your objective is to solve the issue of police reform and not campaign on the issue of police reform the way you do that is by coming to the table and voting yes so that we have an opportunity before the entire American public to understand what the differences are iron them out and move it forward   Mr Scott told reporters.  If this is more about campaign rhetoric and presidential elections then they will not vote yes for this.  Mr McConnell brushed away Democrats’ complaints and insisted that the Senate would proceed with the vote on Wednesday as planned arguing that they should at least try to modify the measure rather than rejecting it before even starting debate.  If they don’t feel like they’ve had fair treatment their remedy is to refuse to finish the bill   he said.  There’s literally no harm done by debating this important topic.  But Democrats appeared to see plenty of risk in proceeding with a measure that falls well short of what their core supporters demand and to be confident that voters would blame Republicans not them for the death of the policing overhaul effort. They have been making the case for nearly two years that the Senate has become a legislative graveyard for Democratic initiatives an impression Mr McConnell himself has often fed. In a letter on Tuesday to Mr McConnell Mr Schumer along with Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey — sponsors of the Democratic bill — called the Republican measure  so threadbare and lacking in substance that it does not even provide a proper baseline for negotiations.   We will not meet this moment by holding a floor vote on the Justice Act nor can we simply amend this bill   they wrote.  This bill is not salvageable and we need bipartisan talks to get to a constructive starting point.  They received additional cover after dozens of civil rights groups including the N.A.A.C.P. and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights wrote to lawmakers urging them to block the legislation.  The question simply is  Who do you trust more on police reform in America   Mr Booker said.  The N.A.A.C.P. or Mitch McConnell   The breakdown fueled frustration in both parties on Tuesday with Republicans and Democrats bitterly pointing fingers at each other for the emerging stalemate even as a frenzied round of hushed discussions unfolded in private to try to salvage the effort.   It’s like asking a mother  save one of your children and leave the others   Ms. Harris replied. In private Mr Scott shocked his colleagues when he spoke at Republicans’ weekly luncheon about death threats he and his aides had received in recent days according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed door remarks. He played some aloud for his colleagues all of whom are white. The calls filled with profanity and racist slurs included one diatribe addressed to  Uncle Tim   where the caller after cruelly and profanely condemning Mr Scott his family and some of his Republican colleagues told Mr Scott to  take your one way ticket straight to hell.  One caller discussed putting the senator  in his cross hairs   Mr Scott said.  It’s interesting that we are on the right side of the police reform conversation yet we’re on the wrong side according to the people based on the way that we are characterized in the national press   Mr Scott said in a brief interview after playing two of the calls his office had received. While racist attacks and threats are not new to Mr Scott or his office he said they had become more aggressive in recent days. Both parties have reason to resist a compromise. Republicans in recent weeks have rushed to devise a response to the public outcry for change putting forward significant policing legislation for the first time in years and beginning to speak in frank terms about racism in America a topic they have often avoided. But they are unwilling to stray too far from President Trump — who has emphasized  law and order   advocated tough police tactics and ignored the issue of racism in law enforcement — and risk alienating their base with the kind of sweeping measures Democrats are demanding.   I do not intend to be a part of a discussion where some might suggest Democrats are trying to stand in the way of police reform   Ms. Harris told reporters.  In this case sadly it is the Democrats — not with any of our Republican colleagues at least so far — that are doing the real work of engaging in what must be reform of the system.  Some lawmakers were holding out hope that closed door conversations between Mr Scott Mr Booker Ms. Harris and others could yet yield a compromise. But leaving one such meeting on Tuesday afternoon Mr Scott voiced no such optimism.  If they won’t even start it   he said of Democrats  that tells me that this is already over.

And the incidents for which he is now under investigation by prosecutors — including shooting a fleeing armed robbery suspect and an allegation that he punched a mentally ill woman who resisted arrest — never resulted in a death or drew national attention like the killings of George Floyd and others that inspired protests.   One morning last December Kelly Jankowski 58 was awakened early by piercing screams. She rushed outside her home in Woodlynne to find that a police officer had handcuffed a black woman on the ground. The woman was screaming so loudly Ms. Jankowski recalled  that I thought she was being killed.  What she said she saw next prompted her to file a police report and a complaint with the county prosecutor. In an interview Ms. Jankowski said the woman was lying on the pavement her hands bound and the officer punched her in the chest.  I went to both the police and the prosecutor because I didn’t want it to be swept under the rug   Ms. Jankowski said.  I never heard anything again.  With details she provided The New York Times obtained from the Woodlynne Police Department the corresponding  use of force  report which officers must file when physical force is used to restrain or arrest a suspect. According to the report Officer Dubiel and a partner approached a woman who had thrown trash in the street that had blown out a passing driver’s tire. At 4 15 a.m. the report notes a 34 year old black woman displaying mental health problems resisted arrest. For the type of force used the form checks off   Compliance hold    Hands fists    Chemical natural agent  and  Strike use of baton or other object.  It identifies Officer Dubiel as making the arrest. His body camera footage which was released to The Times last week after an open records request shows how the woman rambled about how her iPad was stolen how social services had taken her children away and how she suffered from schizophrenia. More than once she said she wanted to kill herself. After radioing their headquarters and learning that arrest warrants were out for her the officers decided to bring her in. A protracted struggle ensued when she resisted and both the woman and Officer Dubiel were injured according to the use of force report. The woman whose name is being withheld at the request of her family said that the police took her to the hospital after the arrest. She said she did not file a complaint against the officer because she did not think she would be believed. transcript  She wants to kill herself.

In both cases as well as the pepper spray incident he was with other officers but only his actions are being investigated.   transcript  Stop.  sirens   gunshot  Shots fired. Shots fired.   moaning   Where’s the weapon  Where’s the weapon    There is no weapon.   Shots fired. Shots fired. We need a medic. You got to get back.   After reviewing the two cases from December Mr Figueroa said he referred them to the Camden County prosecutor’s office. Officer Dubiel was assigned to desk duty.  A month later the protests over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis swept across the nation. In Camden the police marched shoulder to shoulder with demonstrators in a show of solidarity. Officers there then flagged Officer Dubiel’s social media posts to Woodlynne Police. An account using the alias  Duby Copperhead   which former colleagues knew to be Officer Dubiel’s posted a picture of the Camden march showing one officer surrounded by black protesters pumping their fists in the air.  Anybody that stands behind these people is a traitor   he wrote according to images of his now suspended Facebook account that his former colleagues shared with The Times.  I am so ashamed to have ever worked for such a disgrace of a police department.    Officer Dubiel was hired that year in a wave of new recruits according to the department’s spokesman Dan Keashen. He was pushed out two years later as a result of the reforms instituted. Just 24 at the time he had an associate degree in criminal justice from Ocean County College and had already cycled through police departments in Seaside Heights Galloway Edgewater Park and Union City. Some of the jobs were part time but a pattern was emerging  He jumped from place to place. He left one department as storm clouds gathered.  He just wasn’t meeting our standards — we didn’t feel comfortable with him being out there by himself   said Edgewater Park’s police chief Robert D. Hess adding that Officer Dubiel quit before finishing his training in 2012. In Camden he initially did well. Reports from his instructors during training obtained through an open records request repeatedly described his attitude as  positive  and his demeanor toward citizens as  professional.   But he also began racking up use of force reports in a department that was trying to reset its relationship with the community. In a two year period records show Officer Dubiel used force against 16 suspects — a higher than average tally a former colleague said. Using force can mean something as minor as guiding a suspect’s arms to apply handcuffs and is not necessarily a black mark especially if the suspect is armed or dangerous and the amount of force is proportionate to the circumstances Mr Keashen explained. But the reports documenting Officer Dubiel’s use of force raised concerns  At least 13 of the 16 people were unarmed and more than 80 percent were injured during their arrests. In one evaluation that summer Officer Dubiel’s supervisor recommended he get more  de escalation awareness for his use of force incidents.  Citing confidentiality the Camden police declined to disclose the officer’s disciplinary file. But one colleague who had access to it and requested anonymity because of concerns about lawsuits said the patrolman had a history of disciplinary infractions.  Officer Dubiel moved on to Little Falls 100 miles north. When he applied there in 2015 according to Steven Post the police chief nothing in the materials sent from Camden indicated a disciplinary problem.  Four months after he arrived Officer Dubiel resigned and moved to Far Hills which paid more according to the Little Falls police chief Steven Post. Officials there declined to release his record but confirmed that he was fired within three months. An internal affairs investigation accused him of unauthorized absence and an integrity violation and cited concerns over his fitness for duty according to Dorothy S. Hicks the borough’s clerk. After a short stint at a small department that dissolved in Wenonah N.J. Officer Dubiel arrived in Woodlynne last August. But first Lt. John Robinson of the Woodlynne force visited Camden’s police headquarters to review Officer Dubiel’s file there. There were some disciplinary infractions he said but nothing that seemed serious enough to preclude hiring the officer and he was unaware that Officer Dubiel had been fired elsewhere.  Maybe we should have looked more deeply   he said. Mr Figueroa Officer Dubiel’s supervisor in Woodlynne said that he had been unaware of any past disciplinary records or the firing and that it  would have certainly been an alert.  Mr Cappelli in Camden said  At no time did Dubiel get a recommendation for employment from our professional standards bureau or the chief of police.  New Jersey — along with California Hawaii Massachusetts and Rhode Island — is among the few states that cannot revoke an officer’s credentials because of misconduct according to policing experts. Although the state requires officers to undergo training for which they receive a certificate the police in New Jersey have no analogue to the licenses required of other professionals there — licenses that can be stripped said Roger Goldman an emeritus law professor at St. Louis University.  If the state can take away the license of a barber for misconduct surely it should be able to do so for a police officer   Mr Goldman said. A secondary problem is that with no central licensing authority there is also no statewide system to track police abuse a spokesman for the attorney general’s office said. Earlier this month signs in Woodlynne announced a local march against police brutality after the killing of George Floyd. Among Officer Dubiel’s posts to the Duby Copperhead Facebook account around that time was a picture of an AR 15 style rifle lying on his knees with the caption  Come to the suburbs … please.  Concerned officers in Camden said they repeatedly complained to the Woodlynne department. Mr Figueroa said he again gave the officer a talking to.  He felt remorse for what he did and he told us that he’s going to take down the site   Mr Figueroa said. Less than a week after Officer Dubiel and his partner responded to a 911 call from an upset property manager claiming that a group of young men were loitering trespassing and smoking marijuana. It was June 4 at around 1 30 p.m. when Officer Dubiel approached the home of 16 year old James Horn. He and four friends ages 15 17 18 and 20 were out on the stoop smoking tobacco cigarettes and talking loudly. Neighbors say they are a nuisance and often get out of hand — one woman pointed to a window she claims they broke — but no one interviewed supported what happened next. When the officer asked for their IDs the young men told him to get lost.  It’s my house   protested the 16 year old. Then Officer Dubiel lifted his hand and pepper sprayed one of them in the face. As they ran he chased spraying one then another several more times. No marijuana was found. The 20 year old was arrested on charges of smoking tobacco underage smoking the legal age is 21.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/justice-department-protests-violence.html,Justice Dept. to Take Aim at Antigovernment Extremists, The attorney general said that extremists on the far right and left who committed acts of violence during protests against police brutality will be treated like organized crime or terrorists.   Mr Barr said that violent extremists have undermined public order and sought to  become a law unto themselves  through violence and that some may be supported by  foreign entities seeking to sow chaos and disorder.  He did not cite evidence.  Amid peaceful demonstrations protected by the First Amendment we have seen antigovernment extremists engaged in indefensible acts of violence   Mr Barr said noting attacks on police officers and other government officials destruction of public and private property and threats to bystanders.  The ultimate goal of the task force will be not only to enable prosecutions of extremists who engage in violence but to understand these groups well enough that we can stop such violence before it occurs and ultimately eliminate it as a threat to public safety   Mr Barr said.   Although these extremists profess a variety of ideologies they are united in their opposition to the core constitutional values of a democratic society governed by law   Mr Barr said.  They are in fact forces of anarchy destruction and coercion.  Shortly after the killing of George Floyd a black man in Minneapolis who died while being detained by the police demonstrations against police violence were held in cities across the country and in some places people took advantage of the unrest to loot and riot.    We don’t charge them for being a member of antifa   he said.  We charge them for throwing a Molotov cocktail or we charge them for possession of a gun or possession of gasoline and things to make bombs with.  He said that the department was obtaining more information about those suspects. Mr Barr chose Erin Nealy Cox the US attorney for the Northern District of Texas to lead the task force alongside Craig Carpenito the US attorney in New Jersey.  The task force will treat the antigovernment groups in the same way that it does organized criminal or terrorist networks Mr Barr said  by disrupting their violent activities and ultimately dismantling their capability to threaten the rule of law.  Investigators will gather information about the extremists from federal prosecutors the FBI and other parts of the Justice Department and share it with other federal state and local law enforcement offices. ,crimes

WASHINGTON — Facing a groundswell of public support for addressing systemic racism and excessive use of force in law enforcement Democrats and Republicans have unveiled competing proposals to tackle the issues.   Here are some of the main points of contrast that are likely to emerge as sticking points. the house bill   the senate bill    the house bill Title 1 Sec. 102 p. 6. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY REFORM.  From Senator Tim Scott Republican of South Carolina sponsor of The Senate bill   The Senate legislation in its current form does not address the practice though some Republicans indicated that they may be open to discussions around the issue. Senator Mike Braun Republican of Indiana told reporters on Tuesday that he would be introducing separate legislation that would change how qualified immunity was applied. the house bill  The Senate Bill  The Democratic bill would lower the bar for the prosecution of police officers for misconduct. While prosecutors currently need to prove that an officer  willfully  violated an individual’s constitutional rights the Democratic legislation would lower that standard to actions taken  knowingly or with reckless disregard  for a person’s rights. The bill unveiled by Senate Republicans would leave the prosecutorial standard intact. Instead it seeks to address excessive use of force by incentivizing local law enforcement agencies to provide their officers with de escalation and bystander training. the house bill   b  Definition — In this section the term  no knock warrant  means a warrant that allows a law enforcement officer to enter a property without requiring the law enforcement officer to announce the presence of the law enforcement officer or the intention of the law enforcement officer to enter the property. The Senate Bill  The Democratic proposal bans no knock warrants in federal drug cases and also incentivizes states to do the same by limiting the distribution of federal community policing grant funds to state and local governments unless they do so. The Republican legislation merely requires reporting when no knock warrants are used. Senator Rand Paul Republican of Kentucky said he planned to offer an amendment to strengthen that requirement. the house bill  The Senate Bill  The Democratic measure would make federal grant money contingent on the entity or agency receiving the funds explicitly prohibiting racial religious or other discriminatory profiling and mandating anti bias training for all of its officers. It would also increase funding at the Justice Department for  pattern or practice  investigations. The Republican bill does not address racial profiling. It would establish a program through the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington that focuses on the history of racism in America with the goal of training people to educate state and local law enforcement personnel about racial reconciliation. And it would create a Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys that would study rates of homicide arrest and incarceration and death among other things. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/politics/park-police-gregory-monahan.html,Park Police Head Had Been Accused of Illegal Searches and Unreliable Testimony, The force was centrally involved in the authorities’ use of pepper balls to clear protesters from a park near the White House this month.    The episode at Lafayette Square is the latest controversy for the Park Police which prosecutors and defense lawyers say has a reputation for fostering a  cowboy  culture where rules are not of paramount importance. The Park Police a force of about 600 officers that is part of the National Park Service inside the Interior Department has jurisdiction over the nation’s federal parks including the many that dot Washington as well as some highways surrounding the capital. If demonstrators continue to gather in the parks around the White House and Washington’s monuments the Park Police will be the primary force that polices their actions. In a statement in response to questions about Mr Monahan Alexandra Picavet a National Park Service spokeswoman said all  the referenced cases were investigated and the allegations were determined to be unfounded.  She added that all of Mr Monahan’s actions and testimony were appropriate and that the chief  throughout his decades of public service as a law enforcement officer has served with distinction putting his life on the line to protect citizens in upholding the law.  Mr Monahan 48 joined the Park Police in 1997. He was investigated at least four times from 1999 to 2004 on accusations of conducting unlawful body cavity searches according to a 2004 letter written by Kenneth L. Wainstein then the US attorney in Washington to a defense lawyer in a separate case involving Mr Monahan. In one of the four cases federal prosecutors declined to prosecute him the Park Police cleared him in two others and another investigation was pending at the time. In a fifth case a federal judge in Northern Virginia suppressed evidence from the stop of a black motorist whom Mr Monahan pulled over for a cracked windshield in 2002 on the George Washington Memorial Parkway a highway near Washington that the Park Police have jurisdiction over. He searched the man Arrion Ford for drugs by putting his gloved hand in the man’s buttocks on the side of the busy road according to court documents. Mr Monahan had testified that he did nothing wrong. He said he searched Mr Ford because he saw him  clinching his buttocks   suspected he was carrying drugs patted him down and found a package of crack cocaine. The officer said that during his first six years on the force he had made 500 drug arrests and estimated that in 20 percent of those cases suspects had hidden drugs in their buttocks. Mr Ford gave a different account. He testified that after pulling down his shorts and underwear Mr Monahan with the help of two other officers  spread my butt cheek and then he went excuse me went to my rectum and retrieved the item the contraband that he said I had   according to a court transcript of the suppression hearing.  Ms. Picavet said that the Park Police asked federal prosecutors at the time to seek a  reconsideration  of Judge Lee’s decision but that the request was denied. She said that Mr Monahan later testified in numerous other cases and that  his testimony and actions were found to be credible.  But on another occasion Judge Lee who at the time was sitting in Federal District Court in Alexandria dismissed another drug case involving a motorist that Mr Monahan had stopped on suspicion of failing to wear a seatbelt. The judge said he did not find Mr Monahan’s account of the 2002 episode — which resulted in the arrest of the man Rasheed McDaniel — to be credible in part because of Mr Monahan’s testimony in another case.  Analyzing Officer Monahan’s demeanor on the witness stand his testimony about his observations and considering his previous questionable veracity before this court in another traffic stop on the Parkway the court finds improbable that Officer Monahan observed a passenger not wearing his seatbelt as the vehicle was traveling past him for a fleeting second at 1 o’clock in the morning   Judge Lee wrote in a January 2003 decision. Judge Lee who is now retired declined to comment further on the case but said that he stood by the statements he made in court that he found Mr Monahan to be untruthful. In all federal judges suppressed evidence in at least a half dozen criminal cases during the years that Mr Monahan patrolled either national parks in Washington or highways under Park Police jurisdiction in Northern Virginia according to defense lawyers and a review of court filings.  Monahan had by far more cases thrown out because of police misconduct than any other officer I’ve ever dealt with   said Geremy Kamens who heads the Office of the Federal Public Defender for the Eastern District of Virginia and represented Mr Ford in the 2002 case.  Mr Monahan joined the Park Police after getting a bachelor’s degree in business administration from St. Bonaventure University in New York according to his LinkedIn profile. In 2015 his profile said he earned an advanced degree in public administration from the University of Nebraska Omaha. The son of a former New York City police officer he and his family have been active in raising money for a charitable group that supports families of deceased police officers. Just before he was named acting chief Mr Monahan served as the supervisor of the patrol officers at the Presidio a national park in San Francisco — while largely working from offices in Washington according to a union complaint against him. While he was in that post the union that represents the Park Police accused Mr Monahan of asking federal prosecutors to dismiss misdemeanor charges against several people accused of assaulting officers in the Presidio. The union filed a complaint with the federal prosecutor’s office in San Francisco about Mr Monahan saying he wanted the charges dismissed to curry favor with Interior Department officials. Charges against the suspects were eventually dismissed. The union’s complaint is pending before the Interior Department’s independent inspector general.  Two Park Police officers were put on administrative duty pending an investigation into allegations they assaulted an Australian TV crew filming the protests in Lafayette Square.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/us/politics/tim-scott-police-protests.html,Tim Scott  Once Quiet on Matters of Race  Embraces Key Role on Police Reform, The sole black Republican senator cited his personal experiences with racism as a vital perspective to his party’s approach to a law enforcement overhaul.  WASHINGTON — Senator Tim Scott has spent much of his career trying to avoid letting the color of his skin define his political identity keeping a line at the ready to offer to new acquaintances   I am a Christian who is a conservative   he likes to say  — and you may have noticed I’m black.    After years of silence he has spoken publicly on the Senate floor about being racially profiled by the police as a senator on Capitol Hill. It fell to him in 2017 to privately counsel President Trump about the long history of racism. And last week Mr Scott was the one who stood up in a roomful of white Republicans and made a private pitch for a proposal that could answer the strident calls for change — without betraying bedrock party principles. The emerging bill is expected to be far narrower than the sweeping law enforcement overhaul that Democrats have proposed and far short of what civil rights leaders say is necessary but its very existence reflects a personal and political journey for Mr Scott and his view of what can reasonably become law.  We can all sense the opportunity that is before us   he said on the Senate floor on Tuesday.  More than at any time I can remember people of all ages and races are standing up together for the idea that Lady Justice must be blind.  Friends and colleagues say Mr Scott’s thinking on matters of race actually began to shift much earlier in 2015 after his hometown Charleston confronted two tragedies in quick succession  the shooting by a white police officer of an unarmed black man Walter Scott and then the massacre by a white supremacist of nine black churchgoers as they prayed at Emanuel A.M.E. Church. Now Republicans are looking to Mr Scott 54 to be the party’s leading voice in Congress’s first major debate about policing in a quarter century injecting an authoritative conservative voice — who as he might put it also happens to be African American — into the mix.  He has a particular strength in this moment that other people don’t have   said Mark Sanford a former congressman and governor of South Carolina who served alongside Mr Scott.  It’s one thing for a white guy to stand up. It’s a very different thing for a black man to stand up and say ‘Well let me tell you about my personal experience.’  Mr Scott who is frequently described as an eternal optimist guided by his faith has an exceedingly difficult task. He is trying to balance calls from police unions who are resisting changes and civil rights groups that are clamoring for it as well as conservative members of his own party and liberals like Senator Cory Booker Democrat of New Jersey and the only other black man in the Senate. He has been quietly keeping Mr Trump abreast of his work. His unyielding conservatism has also brought bitter and racist vitriol from the left where some have accused him of betraying black Americans in service to his predominantly white party.  Mr Scott has made clear the bill he plans to introduce Wednesday will look quite different from that of Democrats which would make it easier to prosecute and hold police officers liable for excessive use of force outlaw chokeholds and condition federal grants on anti bias training and data collection. He has signaled that the reforms in his bill will largely be targeted at the local level and has explicitly ruled out a Democratic measure to change qualified immunity which shields police officers from being held legally liable for damages sought by citizens whose constitutional rights are found to have been violated.  One of the other things that has been a big deal to him is this sense that if you are a black man in politics you automatically agree with other black people in politics   said Senator James Lankford Republican of Oklahoma and a close ally who is working with Mr Scott on the bill.  There is this quiet kind of pigeonholing of people of color to say you all think alike.  A spokesman declined to make Mr Scott available for an interview. Raised by a single mother who worked 16 hour days as a nurse’s aide Mr Scott grew up sharing a bedroom with his mother and older brother. He did not see the ocean which carried his ancestors to the United States as slaves in the early 1800s until he was a young man. Mr Scott has said the trajectory of his life began to change in high school when he met the owner of a local Chick fil A who pushed Mr Scott then a high school football star toward business laying the foundation for his later embrace of the Republican Party and Mr Scott’s personal mission statement  to have an impact on the lives of one billion people. He found faith in college quit football and contemplated the seminary. Instead Mr Scott went into business becoming a successful insurance salesman and running in 1995 for a seat on the Charleston County Council. He eventually rose to chairman and won a seat in the State Legislature. In 2010 as the Tea Party wave was sweeping the country in backlash to the first black president Barack Obama Mr Scott decided to run for Congress. When the historical significance of the election was pointed out to him by a local reporter Mr Scott bristled.   Afterward Mr Scott and Representative Trey Gowdy a fellow South Carolina Republican traveled around the state holding meetings between police officers and black pastors that Mr Gowdy said evolved into  frank raw conversations about the state of our justice system.  Mr Scott began calling up Mr Gowdy a former federal prosecutor each time an officer involved shooting burst into the news inquiring about the legality surrounding the use of force and the burden of proof in the justice system.  Look at that — tell me what you see   Mr Gowdy recalled Mr Scott asking.  He wants to understand what the cop sees. Does the cop see the color of the skin  Or does the cop see a shiny object    And to colleagues and the public he began opening up about his own experience. He recounted being pulled over by the police seven times in one year  for driving a new car  and said he had been stopped on Capitol Hill by a police officer who did not believe he was a senator despite wearing a members only pin. He has endured much worse that he has spoken about far less publicly. In 2011 after Mr Scott then a congressman announced that he would oppose legislation intended to remedy the debt ceiling crisis angry callers flooded the lines hurling racial epithets at his aides — many of them people of color. His office shut down its phones for the day.  Arguably the most trying episode came after the 2017 neo Nazi rally in Charlottesville Va. when Mr Scott publicly condemned Mr Trump’s suggestion that there had been  very fine people  on  both sides.  His comments got Mr Scott a summons to the White House and a face to face meeting with the president to explain generations of racial hurt.   In weighing this dicey situation I kept in mind that there are some things more important than politics   Mr Scott wrote in his memoir.  Namely that while there may be an ebb and flow in politics I am going to be black for the rest of my life.  ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/nyregion/nypd-police-surveillance-technology-vote.html,Council Forces N.Y.P.D. to Disclose Use of Drones and Other Spy Tech, The bill which the mayor is likely to sign compels the police to disclose the technology they use and data they collect.  The New York Police Department has one of the country’s most sophisticated surveillance and crime solving tool kits with license plate readers cellphone trackers drones and facial recognition software among other technologies. The public knows about them largely through the work of activists and civil libertarians who have fought with lawsuits and transparency requests to pry the information loose. Top police officials have traditionally resisted disclosing their methods saying that to reveal too much would play into the hands of terrorists and criminals. But on Thursday the City Council passed a bill that for the first time will require the police to reveal information about their arsenal of surveillance tools some of which may have been used in recent days at protests in New York. Mayor Bill de Blasio and police officials have previously opposed the bill but changing course this week the mayor said he was now inclined to sign it. The passage of the bill known as the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology — or POST — Act comes amid a flurry of efforts to overhaul the police in New York many of them triggered by the Black Lives Matter demonstrations.  The POST Act passed as the police department under pressure from three straight weeks of protest has said that it intends to move away from brute force crime fighting strategies and rely more on intelligence gathering and technology. The bill does not prevent the police department from employing high tech surveillance but it will force it to reveal what kinds of surveillance tools they use and what kinds of data it collects on New Yorkers. It was part of a package of Council led reforms that included a ban on the police use of chokeholds and a measure requiring on duty officers to display their badge numbers at all times. The bill passed overwhelmingly by a vote of 44 to 6 despite the police department’s continued objection.  To be clear   a police spokeswoman wrote in a statement on Thursday  the bill as currently proposed would literally require the N.Y.P.D. to advertise on its website the covert means and equipment used by undercover officers who risk their lives every day. No reasonable citizen of New York City would ever support that.  The POST Act has a troubled legislative history having languished in committee since it was first introduced in 2017. Thirteen other cities including San Francisco have already adopted similar laws. And as the country has been racked by protests stemming from the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis a handful of tech firms have vowed to move away from the police surveillance business.    These technologies pose a unique risk to black and brown New Yorkers who the N.Y.P.D. has subjected to dangerous invasive policing tactics for decades   Donna Lieberman the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union said in a statement praising the bill’s passage.  Many of these tools have no place in the hands of law enforcement and more action is needed to curtail N.Y.P.D. policing and surveillance abuses.     Other bills in the Council’s package reaffirm the right of New Yorkers to record the police and require improvements in the way the department identifies problematic officers. At a news conference in support of the POST Act on Wednesday Albert Fox Cahn a New York lawyer who runs the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project said the law was central to curbing what he called a misuse of technology.  ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/us/politics/george-floyd-protests-surveillance.html,U.S. Watched George Floyd Protests in 15 Cities Using Aerial Surveillance, From Minneapolis to Buffalo Homeland Security officials dispatched drones helicopters and airplanes to monitor Black Lives Matter protests.  GRAND FORKS N.D. — The Department of Homeland Security deployed helicopters airplanes and drones over 15 cities where demonstrators gathered to protest the death of George Floyd logging at least 270 hours of surveillance far more than previously revealed according to Customs and Border Protection data. The department’s dispatching of unmanned aircraft over protests in Minneapolis last month sparked a congressional inquiry and widespread accusations that the federal agency had infringed on the privacy rights of demonstrators. But that was just one piece of a nationwide operation that deployed resources usually used to patrol the US border for smugglers and illegal crossings. Aircraft filmed demonstrations in Dayton Ohio New York City Buffalo and Philadelphia among other cities sending video footage in real time to control centers managed by Air and Marine Operations a branch of Customs and Border Protection. The footage was then fed into a digital network managed by the Homeland Security Department called  Big Pipe   which can be accessed by other federal agencies and local police departments for use in future investigations according to senior officials with Air and Marine Operations.   Officials at the Customs and Border Protection base here rejected any notion that their fleet of aircraft had been misused either to violate privacy rights or intimidate protesters.  The worst part for me is when we’re made out to be storm troopers   said David Fulcher the deputy director for air operations at the National Air Security Operations Center in Grand Forks.  We believe in peaceful protests.  The aircraft they said were used to provide an eagle eyed view of violent acts and arson. The Predator drone deployed to Minneapolis like eight other unmanned aircraft owned by Air and Marine Operations was neither armed nor equipped with facial recognition technology and flew at a height that made it impossible to identify individuals or license plates according to senior officials here.  The legend of the Predator — the all seeing all knowing hover outside your window Predator — it’s just not accurate   Mr Fulcher said.  The technology is not there.  But House Democrats and privacy advocates still worry over the potential dissemination of the footage and the chilling effect that militarized aircrafts could have on peaceful protests. Earlier this month Democrats with the House Oversight Committee including Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Stephen F. Lynch and Ayanna Pressley both of Massachusetts protested to Chad Wolf the acting secretary of homeland security.  But Democrats apparently were unaware of the breadth of the agency’s actions. Most of surveillance was done with planes and helicopters. Air and Marine Operations did dispatch drones to two demonstrations — in Minneapolis and in Del Rio Texas. The agency’s AS350 helicopters conducted more than 168 hours of surveillance of protests in 13 different cities the longest stretch being 58 hours over Detroit according to data provided by Air and Marine Operations. The agency also deployed a Blackhawk helicopter for nearly 13 hours assisting other federal agencies with surveillance in Washington D.C. Kris Grogan a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection said the agency’s Blackhawk was not one of the helicopters that flew low over the demonstrators and caused panic. A Cessna single engine plane conducted nearly 58 hours of surveillance more than 38 of them over Buffalo. Mark Morgan the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said in a tweet this month that the officers manning that plane helped track down suspects who used an S.U.V. to hit local police on the ground. Most of the requests did not come from local police departments. In Minneapolis the call came from an agent in Homeland Security Investigations the branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement that conducts longer term investigations into terrorists weapons trafficking and drug smuggling. The agent who was on the ground in Minneapolis and works with Air and Marine Operations regularly requested the help on May 28 after reports of arson and violence in the area. Air and Marine Operations which also dispatches drones from Sierra Vista Ariz. and Corpus Christi Texas was not able to send the aircraft until the next day. After about two hours of surveilling the agent and other law enforcement agencies said it was no longer needed.  It’s discretionary but there’s a huge degree of accountability as far as who can say yes or no to deploying these assets   said Jonathan Miller the executive director of the National Air Security Operations at Customs and Border Protection. Air and Marine Operations officials said agency protocol prevents infringement on the right to protest. The drones which can stay in the air from 12 to roughly 24 hours depending on how much radar equipment is attached are directed to fly no lower than 19 000 feet. From that height the  electrical optical infrared ball  on the drones wouldn’t allow the operators to see faces eyes or hair color according to the Department of Homeland Security’s privacy impact assessment for the aircrafts.  A live feed of the footage is sent to a mobile operations center where a group of agents monitor television screens while moving the drone with joysticks. Other federal agents that request a view from the sky can also see the footage on their phones Mr Fulcher said. Mr Fulcher said the surveillance footage stored on the aircraft and in control rooms is overwritten after an average of 30 days by new feeds. But video feeds and radar images sent to  Big Pipe  can also be analyzed by Homeland Security Department intelligence officers. That data may be stored for  up to five years   according to Homeland Security’s Privacy Impact Assessment. If federal agencies or police departments can prove they need the footage for a criminal investigation the video can be provided according to the document and Mr Fulcher. The Department of Homeland Security did not say whether any law enforcement agencies had requested footage of the demonstrations. Jay Stanley a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union said the aircraft could discourage people from protesting. The concern is not only what the border agency is doing with the aircraft and footage but how future operations could adapt to quickly advancing technology.  You see an aircraft you have no idea currently what technologies that aircraft is carrying   Mr Stanley said.  There is something militaristic and dominating about a militarized police aircraft hovering over you when you’re out there protesting police abuse.  Air and Marine Operations recorded more than 92 800 hours of flight time in the fiscal year that ended in September most of that spent patrolling the border. But the helicopters planes and drones spent more than 8 000 hours helping law enforcement agencies with search and rescue missions and other criminal investigations. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-courts.html,N.Y.’s Legal Limbo: Pandemic Creates Backlog of 39 200 Criminal Cases, A justice system based on face to face meetings has been limping along with virtual hearings but officials are struggling with how to restart trials and grand jury proceedings.  Supported by  The coronavirus outbreak is putting extraordinary stress on New York City’s judicial system forcing lengthy delays in criminal proceedings and raising growing concerns about the rights of defendants. Since February the backlog of pending cases in the city’s criminal courts has risen by nearly a third — to 39 200. Hundreds of jury trials in the city have been put on hold indefinitely. Arraignments pleas and evidentiary hearings are being held by video with little public scrutiny. Prosecutions have dropped off too as the authorities have tried to reduce the jail population. Three months into the crisis the city’s once bustling courthouses are barely recognizable. Their spacious lobbies and halls formerly filled with people are nearly empty and in the courtrooms clerks in surgical masks tend to virtual hearings on giant video screens. Two centuries of face to face judicial traditions have either been cast aside or moved online.   Two weeks ago the state courts in New York City took a first small step toward physically reopening  Judges started returning to their chambers though they are still holding court virtually. No one has quite figured out yet how to bring the public back safely to New York City courthouses nor how to resume trials and state grand jury hearings. Officials said the challenge of balancing public health and the requirements of the law is likely to persist for some time.  It’s a situation we’ve just never seen before   said Melinda Katz the Queens district attorney. In spring 2019 there were about 570 criminal trials in New York’s state courts and the city’s courthouses were among the busiest. Before the crisis there were as many as 15 jury trials going on each day in Manhattan Criminal Court alone. This year all trials statewide were postponed in mid March until further notice. To make the move legal Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo suspended the state’s speedy trial laws. Since then not a single trial has been held in the city and several mistrials were declared during trials that could not be finished. Defendants have had to wait many of them in jail. Chester Taylor and Darius Hastings for instance were nearing the end of their murder trial in March when the judge suspended the proceedings because of the pandemic. Since then the two men who maintain they are innocent in the 2016 shooting of a Harlem man who died two years later have sat in cells at the Manhattan Detention Center trying to avoid the virus.  I waited over two years for my day in court   Mr Taylor 34 said during a telephone interview from jail.  We’re supposed to be innocent until proven guilty.  The judge is now seeking to restart the trial on July 14 with jurors spaced out in the gallery the defendants at separate tables and the prosecutors in the jury box Mr Taylor’s lawyer Dawn Florio said. The halt on jury trials while highly unusual and difficult for defendants has not yet reached a crisis point. Even under the best conditions it can take years for cases to move from arrest to trial and only about 5 percent ever get that far most end with a plea bargain. Still jury trials are the heart of the justice system and state court officials face significant hurdles as they resume.  I can’t tell you we have a precise plan   said Judge Lawrence Marks the state’s chief administrative judge.  It will be one of the last phases.  Unlike other court proceedings jury trials require people to hear evidence together and then deliberate in close quarters.  The whole idea of ‘12 Angry Men’ screaming at each other over a telephone over a Zoom network would be ridiculous   said one defense lawyer Joel Cohen. In Federal District Court in Manhattan architects and carpenters have been redesigning courtrooms building jury boxes with additional space and inserting plexiglass dividers to keep jurors safer. Shields are being put in front of witness stands and at lecterns where lawyers argue.   Jury trials are way way down the road   she added. Some jurists warn that a prolonged delay in resuming trials could violate the Constitution.  If well past July and for months to come it is still dangerous for 12 people to gather together in tight quarters to hear and determine civil and criminal cases it is not easy to see how the constitutional right to a jury trial will be genuinely met   Judge Jed S. Rakoff wrote in The New York Review of Books. One Monday evening last month Judge Paul McDonnell of Manhattan Criminal Court approached the desk in his living room that held two laptops and a bottle of hand sanitizer. He pulled a black robe over his light gray suit and tie.  I always wear my robe   Judge McDonnell said.  I want the defendant to understand who I am.  For the next eight hours the judge conducted night court for people arrested in Manhattan on charges ranging from gun possession to assault — all from his Brooklyn apartment. Like other judges in the city he was recently ordered to return to his chambers and hold court virtually from there. Before the pandemic Judge McDonnell had worked in a paneled courtroom overseeing a mass of humanity — defendants clerks prosecutors defense lawyers and family members — all in close quarters engaging in the rituals of American justice. Courthouses in New York are still open to the public officials say and people have a right to enter courtrooms and view proceedings on a video monitor. Still court officers are limiting traffic into the buildings and the digital links needed to watch online are not being made public. People who are arrested no longer set foot inside a physical courtroom to hear the charges against them in an arraignment. They now sit in a windowless booth in a courthouse cell looking into a camera and speaking into a microphone on the wall. Felony arraignments have fallen by 50 percent this spring compared to last largely because far fewer people were arrested in the first weeks of the pandemic. That has made the transition to video somewhat easier though not any faster. In the months after the courts moved to a virtual system the average arrest to arraignment time has increased by as much as three hours. Before the pandemic lawyers generally did most of the talking in court. In the video hearings defendants no longer in the same room as their lawyers have been more prone to sudden and sometimes incriminating outbursts. On May 8 a man arrested in the Bronx on an assault charge became upset when a judge sitting at home set his bail at  5 000. Moments after being led away the defendant ran back into the booth ranting about details of the assault a potential disaster for his defense. A court official asked him to step outside then muted his audio feed. During a pause in the arraignments a cat jumped onto the judge’s desk. Another man asked a judge in Brooklyn federal court last month during a hearing over the telephone if he could have special protection because he was cooperating with the government against his fellow gang members. An uncomfortable silence followed. His lawyer hurriedly asked the judge to seal the transcript. Tina Luongo chief criminal defender for the Legal Aid Society mentioned another challenge  The inability to see a witness s body language and quietly confer with the defendant seriously hampers defense lawyers.  We’ve got to figure that out   she said.  When we’re all on one Skype link how do I talk to my client in a confidential way   Before hearings begin lawyers can meet virtually with clients in private Skype conference rooms but the system is not foolproof. Lara Belkin a lawyer for Legal Aid was in her apartment in Long Island City representing defendants at arraignments in the Bronx on a Friday last month clicking through courtroom links on Skype looking for a client. She entered one virtual room to find another lawyer already using it with a defendant.  Oops   she said clicking out quickly.  That’s not good.  After finding the correct link she yelled the name of a newly arrested individual into an empty video booth.  Please step into Booth D   she shouted. As they discussed the case the audio cut in and out and she asked the man to speak a little louder. He faced a misdemeanor charge for carrying a Taser. Ms. Belkin needed to find out if the government was seeking to keep her client in jail until his trial. In court she could simply have walked up to the prosecutor’s table. On this day however it took her more than an hour to reach the prosecutor by phone. During night court on May 11 Judge McDonnell waited for two hours before the first defendant appeared — a 35 year old man charged with gun possession. The light on the man’s face in the booth was bad.  It’s dehumanizing   the judge said.  I’m asking for light.  The serial number on the pistol the man had been found with was scratched off. But he didn’t have a long record and the judge said the police officer’s reason for stopping him might be called into question. Yet the judge said sending the defendant to jail with high bail might expose him to the virus.  It’s not easy   Judge McDonnell said. Some jurists he went on think it’s not appropriate for a judge to consider whether jails are safe but then he added  We all weigh it.  The pandemic has also shut down many mental health programs he was once able to use as an alternative to jail.  What am I supposed to do   the judge said.  Prior to Covid I had lots of tools.  He set bail terms that would have required the defendant to come up with at least  2 500.  I don’t have any money   the defendant said before being led away. Perhaps the biggest headache for the state courts has been the inability to convene grand juries which given their size — they are usually composed of 16 to 23 people — have been unable to gather safely. Grand juries have traditionally acted as a citizen’s check on overzealous prosecutions by scrutinizing evidence and approving formal charges. They are also used by state and federal prosecutors to conduct long term investigations. Without them the rights of both defendants and crime victims are less assured. In New York anyone arrested on a felony charge must be freed if a grand jury fails to indict within six days. Gov. Cuomo has suspended that deadline which last month had left about 400 people in custody — in jails that have become hotbeds of infection — without the cases against them being tested. That figure dropped to 87 as of last week.  You’ve had no opportunity to challenge the evidence   said Elizabeth Daniel Vasquez a lawyer with Brooklyn Defender Services. Unable to convene grand juries the city’s five district attorneys are turning instead to preliminary hearings which have not been conducted in New York in decades. At the hearings judges hear witnesses consider evidence and decide if prosecutors’ charges are warranted. Like everything else these days these hearings are being held by video. Weeden Wetmore the district attorney in upstate Chemung County convened a remote preliminary hearing last month — on the portico of his office. The judge was at the local county courthouse the defendant in the county jail and the defense lawyer at his office. The witness a 17 year old girl who said she had been robbed at knifepoint arrived to testify on a bicycle. Mr Wetmore plans to continue the al fresco hearings for as long as possible.  We’re praying for good weather   he said. In Queens Ms. Katz has set aside six rooms on three floors of her office so that simultaneous hearings can be held. Each room has its own feed  three for her prosecutors and three for their witnesses. The witnesses could not be in the same room as prosecutors to avoid suggestions that they were being coached.  The criminal justice system is not exactly known for its flexibility   said Jennifer Naiburg the chief deputy prosecutor in Queens.  We’re definitely flexible now.  The city’s two federal courts in Manhattan and Brooklyn have adapted more smoothly to the crisis. Under their auspices grand jurors began meeting again recently outside the city in White Plains and Central Islip. And in both courts regular audio and video hearings have been held with dial in numbers for the public clearly posted on electronic dockets. But obstacles remain like how to bring in large numbers of prospective jurors for screening.  At a teleconference in April a jury official explained that bringing in so many potential jurors might take three days  with things being normal.  But with social distancing guidelines she added  I don’t know what the new normal would be.  Shaila Dewan contributed reporting. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/nyregion/amy-cooper-central-park-false-report-charge.html,Case Against Amy Cooper Lacks Key Element: Victim’s Cooperation, Ms. Cooper who is white is facing a charge of filing a false police report after she claimed a Black birdwatcher threatened her in Central Park during a dispute over her dog.     On the one hand she’s already paid a steep price   Mr Cooper said in a statement on Tuesday.  That’s not enough of a deterrent to others  Bringing her more misery just seems like piling on.  But he added that he understood there was a greater principle at stake and that this should be defended.  So if the DA feels the need to pursue charges he should pursue charges. But he can do that without me.  Mr Cooper’s decision not to cooperate may present some challenges for prosecutors. But it also reflects a wider debate among people who generally consider themselves allies in the growing movement to call attention to and fight racism not just in policing but in society. The announcement that she will now be prosecuted has drawn mixed reactions from Black community leaders and advocates for overhauling the criminal justice system.  Some social justice advocates said that Ms. Cooper’s case should serve as a warning to others who might seek to wrongfully use the police in a racially charged encounter. But some argued that charging her criminally reinforces the idea that the only just consequence for wrongdoing should be incarceration. For instance Josie Duffy Rice the president of The Appeal a nonprofit website said that bringing criminal charges against Ms. Cooper legitimizes a criminal justice system that she considers to be flawed and racist.  Ask yourself what criminal charges can do to Amy Cooper that hasn’t already been done   Ms. Duffy Rice wrote in a tweet without capitalization and missing some punctuation.  Has she not faced consequences  She did something absolutely horrible and she lost her job her dog her personal business was on the front page of the paper.  The incident on Memorial Day weekend began when Mr Cooper an avid birder was looking for birds in a wild part of the park known as the Ramble and encountered Ms. Cooper as she walked with her dog off the leash. He asked her to leash the dog. She refused and he began filming. Ms. Cooper said she would tell the police that  an African American man is threatening my life  before dialing 911.  On Monday the Manhattan district attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. announced plans to charge Ms. Cooper with falsely reporting the confrontation a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of a year behind bars. If convicted however she is likely to receive a conditional discharge or be sentenced to community service or counseling. She was ordered to appear in court on Oct. 14. Ms. Cooper’s attorney Robert Barnes has said his client would fight the charge. Mr Vance’s decision received praise in some quarters.  Her racist behavior could have had dire consequences for a Black man   Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter.  Glad she’ll face consequences of her own.  Others pointed out that Ms. Cooper’s actions might have had dire consequences and she should be held responsible regardless of Mr Cooper’s sympathy for her plight.  If the police believed she was really being attacked they could have come in with guns drawn and she would have been the only witness in this — outside of that video that may or may not have surfaced   said Gloria J. Browne Marshall a professor of constitutional law at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.  This isn’t just about Christian Cooper. The community has been harmed by the actions of Amy Cooper and in order to rectify this then the people of New York need to have their day in court even if Christian Cooper is a reluctant witness.  Ms. Browne Marshall said the case was only the latest example in a long history of incidents in which white people have summoned law enforcement and falsely accused a Black person of a crime. Others have compared the case to the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till. The video of the incident captured on Mr Cooper’s phone shows Ms. Cooper with a tight grip on her dog’s collar. She says to a 911 operator in a high frantic voice   I’m in the Ramble there is a man African American. He has a bicycle helmet and he is recording me and threatening me and my dog.  Before ending the call she adds  I am being threatened by a man in the Ramble please send the cops immediately   Mr Cooper said in a Facebook post that after the woman refused to leash her dog he decided to offer the dog treats in an effort to convince her to abide by the leash law.  Look if you’re going to do what you want I’m going to do what I want but you’re not going to like it   he told her before he pulled out the treats and began filming according to his post. Alvin Bragg a former federal prosecutor and a professor at New York Law School said the video provides sufficient evidence for the prosecution and that her focus on his race suggests she intended to file a false report a necessary element to prove a crime.  There is a false weepy tone and she strategically placed significance on race   Mr Bragg said.  She is harping on deep historical issues in our country. She is emphasizing those words and she knows the effect it can have on the listener.  To prevail at trial prosecutors will have to prove that Ms. Cooper did not believe in that moment she was being threatened and that she intended to file a false complaint against him said Daniel R. Alonso a former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan.  A threat can be ‘I’m going to kill you ’ or it can be subtle   Mr Alonso said.  She may well have believed at the time that his statement was threatening in her definition.  But Marc Lamont Hill a media studies professor at Temple University who supports defunding police departments said the case has forced some advocates who want change the criminal justice system to reimagine how justice might be served in this instance.  We can’t criminalize our way out of social problems   he said. Mr Hill expressed doubt that Ms. Cooper’s prosecution might stop other similar incidents. He also said that it might send the wrong message to victims of rape or domestic violence who after complaining to police decide not to cooperate with prosecutors and might fear being charged with filing a false report. Councilman Donovan J. Richards a Queens Democrat who chairs the public safety committee said that he was not overjoyed to hear that charges had been brought against Ms. Cooper. For him the matter was complicated.  I don’t think any of us are celebrating the fact that she was arrested   said Mr Richards who is Black.  I’m hoping at the end of the day she learned her lesson and that this is a teachable moment for folks — that they can’t just call 911 and put people’s lives in danger just because their privilege is being checked.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/mandatory-minimum-sentences-protest.html,How Mandatory Minimums Are Weaponized, After a protest two Brooklyn lawyers are each facing 45 years behind bars.  Mr Dhaliwal is a lawyer.  Their story is just one example of how many senseless mandatory minimum penalties — blind to the facts of a case and the stories of the individual defendants — remain enshrined in law and must be changed.      Thirty years of the 45 year mandatory minimum sentence that Mr Mattis and Ms. Rahman face comes from Section 924 c  of Title 18 of the United States Code which sets forth mandatory penalties for certain criminal offenses and has long been used by prosecutors to threaten and impose extraordinarily harsh penalties.     The message that prosecutors send to them and to so many other defendants is clear  If you consider exercising your fundamental right to trial we will seek penalties that are so excessive that you will think twice because we have the power to take sentencing authority away from the judiciary.    Sandeep Dhaliwal is a lawyer at Debevoise   Plimpton whose pro bono practice focuses on criminal justice and immigration.   ,crimes

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/opinion/coronavirus-jail.html,Stop Unnecessary Arrests to Slow Coronavirus Spread, People cycled through jails on minor offenses are taking the virus back to their communities.  Mr Reinhart is a Ph.D. candidate in anthropology at Harvard and a medical student at the University of Chicago.   It’s not hard to understand why. People are arrested for low level crimes processed through crowded jail spaces where the risk of infection is high and then sent back to their communities where they inadvertently spread the virus. We found that this churn of arrest jailing and release was more consequential than race poverty population density and public transit as a harbinger of Covid 19 cases. On average for each person cycled through Cook County Jail our research shows that an additional 2.149 cases of Covid 19 appeared in their ZIP code within three to four weeks after the inmate’s discharge. At least 60 percent of these cases were in Black majority ZIP codes.    Based on our study in Chicago it seems clear that standard policing and incarceration policies are driving preventable spread of the virus. These policies are now harming not just inmates and overly policed communities of color but also the rest of America. Infectious disease does not respect segregation or geographic barriers and the disproportionate sickness and death from the virus that has afflicted minority neighborhoods is now widening. Many emergency medical workers police officers health care workers and jail guards have most likely become sick and died because of transmission linked to our national obsession with incarceration as a solution to social problems and crime. Society’s excessive reliance on arrests and incarcerations is putting jail administrators in impossible positions. Because of the incubation period of the virus and asymptomatic transmissions efforts in jails to reduce spread including increased testing at the time of booking reducing jail populations and better sanitation are not sufficient to stop the virus. If only one person in these crowded spaces is infected by the end of processing more are likely to be. And with each passing day more people are being released from jails with the belief that they are negative for the coronavirus when in reality the virus may have already begun to spread in their bodies. They may soon become infectious to others particularly family members and close contacts.  If we fail to do this the criminal justice system will continue to exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus leaving death in its wake.

https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/17/business/update-barry-minkow-the-knowledge-of-the-perpetrator.html,UPDATE/BARRY MINKOW  'The Knowledge of the Perpetrator', UPDATE BARRY MINKOW  AT 16 Barry Minkow started a carpet cleaning company ZZZZ Best in his parents  basement in Reseda Calif. a suburb of Los Angeles. By the time he was 23 Mr Minkow was serving a 25 year sentence for securities and bank fraud stemming from the company s collapse and had been ordered to pay  26 million in restitution. The government s sentencing memorandum described Mr Minkow as a remorseless liar and thief whose schemes had cost victims more than  100 million. Mr Minkow now 35 helped to found the Fraud Discovery Institute a private online learning center that wants to help companies like banks and accounting firms detect what he once specialized in    corporate fraud. He is now its chief consultant.   I did hard time and I deserved it because I was wrong    Mr Minkow said of the seven years he spent in prison a shorter term thanks to a change in parole guidelines.   I have a ton of good info to get out there. It s using the knowledge of the perpetrator.   The institute s first online course costs  285 and is available at www.frauddiscovery.net. The course which takes about 12 hours to complete covers subjects like hidden corporate debt bank fraud and the psychology of fraud with online discussion groups and videos. Mr Minkow who wrote more than half of the curriculum said he drew on his personal experiences as well as case studies.   Here we are in the middle of this tidal wave    Mr Minkow said at a time when accusations of accounting abuses are swirling in corporate America. But he said that the institute had been working for some time   to find a proactive solution to what we see as a major problem.   To pay part of his court ordered restitution Mr Minkow said he used all the profits from   Clean Sweep    a book about ZZZZ Best that he wrote in prison and his income from the last few years on the lecture circuit. He paid  25 000 to victims in 2001 he is contesting the total amount due.

https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/15/weekinreview/the-packaging-of-a-perpetrator.html,The Packaging Of a Perpetrator, The Nation  THE perp walk got a new look in Arkansas last week when a mini skirted Susan McDougal was led from the United States Courthouse and Post Office Building in Little Rock in chains and leg irons for vowing to maintain her silence about her former partner in the Whitewater venture Bill Clinton. It was an odd twist on the customary perp walk a decades long tradition designed to satisfy a hungry press corps permit cops to gloat over their latest catch help prosecutors mold public opinion and humiliate suspects who find themselves in the government s cross hairs. The opprobrium of the typical Walk of the Perpetrator before reporters and photographers has compelled many a prisoner to struggle to conceal a face or a manacled pair of wrists under a coat hat or anything else at hand. The walk done right is also supposed to make the prisoner look dangerous like someone who would mail package bombs for two decades blow up a building in Oklahoma City or attempt to assassinate a President. But last week in Little Rock it made the Marshals Service look like the heavy. For Mr . McDougal who in her campaign to avoid jail has been trying in recent days to evoke public sympathy and portray herself as a victim her shackled gait could not have been better choreographed if it had been arranged by her lawyers. Walking cautiously in front of the whirring cameras Mr . McDougal played perfectly the role she has sought to cast herself in  wide eyed and innocent bit player in the legal battle between the Whitewater independent counsel and the White House. The Housewife Idea In television interviews shortly before her incarceration she had asserted she was no different from the ordinary housewife who signed a couple s financial papers with little knowledge of what they were.  Investigators have a far different account  Whitewater prosecutors have already proved to a jury that she knowingly defrauded the Federal Government of  300 000 while California authorities are hoping to try her soon on charges that she stole  150 000 from the conductor Zubin Mehta and his wife when she worked for them.  Her walk prompted scores of complaints to the office of the Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr even though by all accounts Mr Starr and his deputies had nothing to do with how Mr . McDougal was taken away. Federal marshals said last week that they treated Mr . McDougal no differently than any other prisoner in their custody. Their rules require that any prisoner in transit be shackled with leg chains and handcuffs linked to a waist chain.   We re required to do that for everyone    said Conrad Pattillo the United States Marshal for the Eastern District of Arkansas.   It s a service wide requirement.   Mr . McDougal used the same courthouse door used by all prisoners in Little Rock and no attempt was made by the authorities to either help or hinder the flocking cameras. Other authorities said the rule s only exception is for prisoners with physical infirmities but black stockings and pumps don t count. The leg chains may be removed for steps and other obstacles the rules also say.   Any inference that Mr . McDougal was chained for a staged photo is simply ridiculous    said Bill Dempsey a spokesman for the Marshals Service. He said the practice of shackling prisoners is at least 25 years old and may actually go back to the founding of the Marshals Service in 1789. He said it is intended to protect both the marshals and the suspects.   We do this for everyone clergymen doctors lawyers Indian chiefs. Noncompliance with the rule by a marshal is a very serious offense.   Still in the constant public relations struggle between prosecutors and defendants the perp walk has almost always worked in the prosecutors  favor leaving the image of a suspect as a true villain. In courtrooms judges rarely permit the authorities to chain defendants in the presence of jurors for fear of such a prejudicial sight but what they can t get across in court the authorities can convey by permitting television cameras to capture a defendant moving in and out of the courthouse. Indeed the public perceptions of Theodore Kaczynski  accused of being the Unabomber  Timothy McVeigh  accused of bombing the Federal building in Oklahoma City  and Aldrich Ames  the master CIA mole for Moscow  have been shaped by the images of them paraded in chains. It also helps if the prisoner is left unshaven and unkempt or is provided the standard issue orange jumpsuit that makes it appear as though he has already been convicted. Small wonder then that Mr . McDougal chose a white blouse and a pleated skirt. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/05/tv/cover-story-a-perfectionist-pursues-the-perpetrators.html,COVER STORY  A Perfectionist Pursues the Perpetrators, COVER STORY  HOLDING court in   The Golden Spiders    which has its premiere tonight at 8 on A E Nero Wolfe manages to insult assault irritate alienate and otherwise irk just about every other character in the story. He threatens to hold a well bred society matron hostage until she truthfully reveals the information he demands. He enrages a high ranking New York police officer by refusing to acknowledge a question until it is phrased in lucid grammatically correct form. To the chagrin of his personal chef he even sends an elaborately contrived dish back to the kitchen. And what does the great detective have to say for himself    Pfui.   Pfui indeed. With an intellect   not to mention an ego   as gargantuan as he is Wolfe need apologize to no one for his imperious manner.   Do you need to be told again that I am an artist    he demands of Archie Goodwin  Timothy Hutton  his admiring but uncowed assistant. In more than 70 novels and novellas written by Rex Stout between 1934 and 1975 this master sleuth has solved some of the most fiendishly difficult mysteries in genre literature   for the most part without setting foot outside his sumptuously furnished Manhattan brownstone on West 35th Street. Didact polymath artist genius the great man does not suffer fools gladly. He chews them up and spits them out on the Aubusson carpet.   He has a mind like a deductive machine which he accepts as his gift    says Maury Chaykin the Canadian actor who stars in the role   but which also makes him intolerant of ignorance and incompetence in others.   As a character actor  his extensive film credit include   The Sweet Hereafter   and   Devil in a Blue Dress    Mr Chaykin knows the value of the subtle but precise gesture   a raised eyebrow puckered lip or slow turn of the head   that can convey this contempt for lesser mortals. But with Wolfe s encyclopedia of eccentricities the acting challenges are infinite.   I understand the technique of eccentricity    the detective once said.   It would be futile for a man to labor at establishing a reputation for oddity if he were ready at the slightest provocation to revert to normal action.   Famously reclusive he harbor phobic fears of mechanical conveyances emotional women and poverty. Fastidious about his creature comforts he indulges sophisticated tastes in food and drink  he is a beer connoisseur  and surrounds himself with beautiful things. If he has a pure passion it is for the 10 000 rare orchids that he cultivates in his greenhouse and devotedly tends each day.   The orchids have something to do with perfection    Mr Chaykin says.   If you look at an orchid there s something delicate and pristine and ultimately perfect about it. It represents serenity and clear thinking.   Like his creator Rex Stout who was a math prodigy by the age of 9 and had polished off his father s 1 126 volume library before he reach puberty Nero Wolfe manifested his intellect  and Olympian arrogance  from the outset of his fictive life.   There is something in me that can help you    he tells a prospective client in his first case   Fer de Lance    1934 .   It is genius but you have not furnished the stimulant to arouse it.   The caracter s verbal dexterity is an actor s dream.   He rips people apart with his words    says Mr Chaykin.   That s his punishment for their sloppiness of language of thought.   Given Wolfe s girth  he weighs in at 285 pounds 11 ounces or 1 7 of a ton  the towering rages of the great man can rattle the chandeliers. He bellows. He bullies. He  gasp  refuses to eat. There is a classic scene in   Gambit    1962  in which he burns the pages of Webster s Third Edition to show his contept for the lexicographers  lax standards. In   The Golden Spiders    1953  he has to restrain himself from ejecting a visitor who uses   contact   as a verb. Along with Wolfe s invincible intellect and refined sensibilities this temper secures him an honored place among cranky geniuses like Edgar Allan Poe s C. Auguste Dupin John Dickson Carr s Dr. Gideon Fell Arthur Conan Doyle s Sherlock Holmes and Colin Dexter s Inspector Morse.   Wolfe is easily aroused to anger but most of the time he is very firm and completely controlled in the expression of it    says Mr Chaykin   He s like the angry father who doesn t necessarily yell or scream when he is disciplining his child. He tends to grow cold and withhold emotion.   Like Sherlock Holmes s Dr. Watson and Inspector Morse s Sergeant Lewis Wolfe s hard working assistant Archie Goodwin is often on the receiving end of this gimlet eye of disapproval. But unlike those awed underlings the quick witted Goodwin is less his master s lackey than his accomplice. In   The Golden Spiders    he gives as good as he gets goading Wolfe into taking street urchin s case for  4.30 and trapping him into uncharactertistic displays of sentiment.   In some ways Archie treats Wolfe like a child    Mr Chaykin says   and in some ways he is a child content to stay in this world he s created surrounded by all his playthings but terrified to go outside.   Mr Chaykin finds the novels strewn with psychological clues to Wolfe s phobic behavior.   We all build order and create structure in our lives to keep ourselves from crumbling    he says.   Wolfe has constructed this very elaborate life for himself inside his brownstone and within his own realm he has total control. But he has no control over the chaos in the outside world where there is no protection from the disorderly thoughts and dangerous emotions he would perfer not to deal with.   For all the thought and research that Chaykin has put into his portrayal of the brilliant and maddening Nero Wolfe the actor feels that he has   just scratched the surface   of his enigmatic character.   I would really look forward to exploring his less obvious qualities    he says mentioning in particular Wolfe s fear of women    He associates them with uncontrollable emotion which terrifies him    and the core of vulnerability that drives his passion for power    He has this profound fear of losing control and falling apart   . But why stop there  If A E decides to expand this original movie into a series maybe he ll even get a chance yellow silk pajamas a sight we re all longing to see. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/02/movies/film-review-shenanigans-as-wacky-as-their-perpetrators.html,FILM REVIEW  Shenanigans as Wacky As Their Perpetrators, FILM REVIEW  More than a dozen of New York s finest actors ham it up with such unrestrained glee in Stanley Tucci s period farce   The Impostors   that it hardly matters if this swirl of cotton candy disappears even before it touches the tip of your tongue. Playing out of work actors posing as stewards on a 1930 s cruise ship packed with caricatures of bogus aristocrats and hissable villains Mr Tucci and Oliver Platt evoke everyone from Laurel and Hardy to the Marx Brothers as they skid from one absurd scrape to the next. The movie s earliest  and best  scenes find these starving actors practicing their craft by doing melodramatic skits in public places. At a Central Park cafe they terrify the patrons by pretending to be strangers at adjoining tables who get into a squabble that escalates into a lethal knife fight. Mr Tucci and Mr Platt play this scene over the film s opening credits in the best silent clown tradition. The pair s real troubles begin after a Broadway performance of   Hamlet    starring the world famous English actor and notorious drunk Jeremy Burtom  Alfred Molina . He overhears them trashing his performance in a bar after the show picks a fight and claims to be gravely injured. He so panics Maurice  Mr Platt  and Arthur  Mr Tucci  that they dash onto the nearest boat docked on the Hudson and cower in a packing crate. As the vessel sets sail they emerge dressed as stewards. But to their horror their nemesis turns up as a passenger still ranting and raving and they are forced to improvise new disguises while dashing from stateroom to stateroom. The passengers make up an overstuffed roster of stock 30 s movie caricatures of the sort Peter Sellers used to play in his man of a thousand faces heyday. Dana Ivey is a penniless grande dame determined to marry off her terminally depressed daughter  Hope Davis  to the first ancient millionaire who dodders into sight. Richard Jenkins and Allison Janney are a gangster and his moll plotting mayhem while posing as French aristocrats. Also on board are a deposed queen  Isabella Rossellini  a suicidal band singer  Steve Buscemi  a proto fascist German steward  Campbell Scott  a giggly African sheik  Teagle F. Bougere  and a Scottish tennis pro obsessed with arm wrestling and   Greek love    Billy Connolly .   The Impostors   crams too many characters onto this ship of fools and has a flat ending borrowed from Woody Allen s   Radio Days.    Mr Allen puts in an unbilled cameo appearance as the world s most hapless playwright . But the comic chemistry of Mr Tucci s nervous wiry Arthur and Mr Platt s portly befuddled Maurice who eventually dons a gown and Shirley Temple wig to evoke the   Charlie s Aunt   era of movie drag is sound. For a movie like   The Impostors   to succeed you don t need much scintillating dialogue. All you have to do is know how to look hopelessly inept as stacks of luggage tumble from your grasp in a landslide of flying suitcases and flailing limbs leaving all pretenses to grace and dignity forever shattered.   The Impostors   is rated R  Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian . It includes off color humor.

https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/20/opinion/pols-and-other-perpetrators.html,POLS AND OTHER PERPETRATORS,  Chicago which likes to think of itself as the city primeval has burst into sensational flower this winter. Tuesday s Democratic mayoral primary has produced some strange growths and simultaneously the underworld volcanically disturbed by pressure from the Federal Government has erupted spectacularly. Not long ago Allen Dorfman of the teamsters  pension fund was gunned down in a parking lot. Now plea bargaining witnesses are talking freely about Joey  The Clown  Lombardo convicted with Dorfman and Roy Williams the teamsters  union president of conspiring to bribe Senator Howard W. Cannon of Nevada. Politics are politics crime is crime but in Chicago they occasionally overlap. The line between virtue and vice meanders madly   effective government on one side connections on the other. Odd things happen. Just the other day a middle level mob personality Tokyo Joe Eto having reason to feel that his time had come instructed his wife to put his insurance policies in order. Sure enough he was soon afterwards shot in the head by two associates who had gotten into his car. Three shots were fired from the back seat none of which pierced his skull. With extraordinary presence of mind he fell over the steering wheel shuddered convulsively and played dead. As soon as the associates had fled Eto staggered over to the Terminal Drug Store on Grand Avenue. The cops came and took him to the hospital. Promised protection by the FBI Eto named his assailants. One of these alleged assailants John Gattuso turned out to be a Cook County deputy sheriff employed as a process server. Informed of his arrest his superior Sheriff Richard Elrod suspended Gattuso and ordered a disciplinary hearing. A hit man on the county payroll  Would there be others  Well that s how it is. People shrug. They make jokes about Tokyo Joe s steel skull and they wait for ballistics experts and anatomists to tell them how he survived. In politics the big event of recent days was Adlai E. Stevenson s endorsement of Richard M. Daley Mayor Jane M. Byrne s principal rival in the primary. In his statement Stevenson who nearly became governor in the November elections said that he had been offered a considerable chunk of money for his campaign by Jane Byrne s principal fund raiser Charlie Swibel on condition that he endorse and support Jane when the time came. This because he was a gentleman no one would ever accuse of venality Stevenson refused to do. Immediately Stevenson was attacked by Alderman Edward R. Vrdolyak chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party who called him a phony and a liar. Swibel did not speak for himself because he was on holiday in Florida. Stevenson s betrayal of the insiders  code set Alderman Vrdolyak in a fury. Why he asked had the Senator kept such important information to himself until this moment  Not a bad question. A gubernatorial candidate doesn t blast the Democratic Mayor in mid campaign. Vrdolyak s tacit message for Chicago was you can t trust these high born remote silk stocking types. No matter how much you do for them they ll freak out and turn on you. We almost made this guy governor and see how he repays us.

https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/17/archives/how-to-perpetrate-an-outrage.html,How to Perpetrate an Outrage,  WASHINGTON Feb. 16—Nearly a century ago Speaker Thomas B. Reed Republican of Maine broke the back of minority rights in the House of Representatives by taking away its power to filibuster.  The right of a minority is to draw its salaries    Czar  Reed scorned  and its function is to make a quorum.  Speaker Reed is remembered today for the way he liked to inform the helpless minority leaders of his decisions   Gentlemen we have decided to perpetrate the following outrage.  The times they are not a‐changin . In this era of  reform   with its new emphasis on  ethics  and its sensitivity to the rights of minorities the House of Representatives is run as imperiously as in the days of Reed with corruption concealed and responsibility evaded as it was in the days of the first House  Czar.  How does the unrestrained power of the Speaker manifest itself  Let us count the ways  1. The I‐Never‐Voted‐For‐It‐But‐ICouldn t‐Stop‐It Pay Raise. This is a trick devised by the House Democratic leaders in 1967 to evade accountability for a pay increase. The charade is for the President to make salary recommendations for Federal employees which become law automatically unless either chamber passes a resolution of disapproval. But it would take 218 members of Congress to blast such a resolution out of committee and onto the floor for a vote disapproving the 30 percent pay hike. The Speaker quietly shakes his head no vote. The minority leader introduces a bill to make it possible for House members to vote for or against the pay raise. The Speaker smiles and bottles that bill in his Rules Committee where it will die. Maybe a pay raise is fair perhaps not. But Representatives are elected to represent and to vote and to be held accountable for their votes by the voters. Under Speaker O Neill we are witnessing who‐me  legislation sheltering from embarrassment Congressmen too cowardly to vote for the pay raise. We do not elect men to Congress to spare them embarrassment. We elect them to make a record which voters can then ratify or reject. This nonvoting pay raise trick is a shabby abandonment of that principle and is opposed futilely by a minority whose right  is to draw its salaries  and shut up. 2. The anti‐dissent organization rules. Why did every Republican vote against the adoption of the rules of the 95th Congress last month  Because the minority was slammed up against the wall in a display of arrogance that —had it been practiced by anyone but certified Good Guys—would be attacked as dictatorial as  Reed s Rules  by every liberal commentator. Here s the hook which has rated no notice but which has helped eviscerate opposition to Czar O Neill  The number of members needed to make a quorum within a committee has been changed. It used to be a majority now it is one third. What with the small sprinkling of opposition members this little trick means that Democrats can hold committee meetings and mark up bills without any Republican participation. 3. The  forgive and forget  ethics coae. The proposal that Czar O Neill laughingly calls his  ethics code  resolutely forgets the past and calls on solons to be kind truthful and reverent in the future. The hot reforming zeal of the O Neill of 1973 suddenly cooled when it came to probing Democrats. Minority Leader John Rhodes has proposed a Select Committee made up of an equal membership of both parties  like the Senate s Watergate Committee  to conduct a thorough audit of all members’ accounts for the past six years. In the light of the quickly shushed scandal in the accounts of Mr O Neill s deputy Democratic Majority Leader Jim Wright this would clearly be in the public interest. But Czar Tip has crushed the minority proposal. He has denied the public an independent audit because there is a rot in the House and I suspect that rot extends into the office of the Speaker in the form of cash payments which have not yet been revealed made to House members by South Korean lobbyists. The Speaker appears to have plenty to hide which is why he Is refusing to permit an audit the pity is that the watchmen in the night have now fallen asleep. 4. Recess reform. Lest this department be considered unduly severe on a genial old pol whose  500  tips  to obedient Congressmen was in the grand tradition of influence purchasing and whose intercession with building officials on behalf of fund‐raiser James Wilmot recall the halcyon days of William Marcy Tweed a word in his favor  Tip O Neill s forthright and fearless decision to change the name of the time Congress goes out of session from the lackadaisical  recess  to the dynamic  district work period  deserves the approbation of euphemists around the world.  Congressional fence‐mending visits are now to be called  incursions.   When Jimmy Carter down the street smiled publicly at the newest linguistic pretension the Speaker s office let the White House know that our hot Tip was not amused  The President is not to mess with the Speaker when he is about to perpetrate his outrages. ,crimes

Two white people in California were charged on Tuesday with a hate crime and other offenses after video appeared to show them vandalizing a Black Lives Matter mural on July 4 officials said.  Diana Becton the district attorney said  The mural completed last weekend was a peaceful and powerful way to communicate the importance of Black lives in Contra Costa County and the country.  The mural was painted on July 4 in front of a courthouse in Martinez a site that the city selected when it issued a permit to the mural’s organizer. Within an hour of its completion it was vandalized said the organizer Justin Gomez. Video of the episode showed a woman using black paint and a roller brush to cover the letters  B  and  L.  She was joined by a man in a red cap and a red shirt that reads  Trump  and  Four More Years   who can be heard saying   We’re sick of this narrative  and  the narrative of police brutality the narrative of oppression the narrative of racism. It’s a lie. It’s a lie.  The woman using two expletives tells onlookers to  keep this  in New York adding  This is not happening in my town.  The mural has been restored and residents were  maintaining a presence  to prevent further damage Mr Gomez had said. In addition to the hate crime charges the two people each face a charge of vandalism under  400 and possession of tools to commit vandalism or graffiti. All of the charges are misdemeanors and no court date has been scheduled according to a spokesman for the district attorney’s office. If convicted the couple face up to a year in jail the district attorney’s office said. Efforts to reach Ms. Anderson and Mr Nelson at multiple phone numbers on Tuesday night were not successful. Separately the Martinez police said Tuesday that they were investigating the illegal painting of  White Lives Matter  on a road elsewhere in the city. The police said in a statement that officers had found a woman painting over the white letters in black paint and that they were trying to identify who had first painted the words.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/politics/latinos-police-racism-black-lives-matter.html,Latinos Back Black Lives Matter Protests. They Want Change for Themselves  Too., Many Latinos are pushing for an acknowledgment of the systemic racism they face and a conversation about overpolicing in their own communities.  PHOENIX —  Tu lucha es mi lucha   several signs declared at a recent Black Lives Matter protest near the Arizona State Capitol. Your struggle is my struggle. The sea of faces included young Latinos who had marched before during the immigrant rights movement in the state a decade ago when Joe Arpaio championed draconian policies as the sheriff of Maricopa County. There was no doubt in these protesters’ minds  Their fights against racism are bound up together.  Black and brown  has been a catchphrase in Democratic politics and progressive activist circles for years envisioning the two minority groups as a coalition with both electoral power and an array of shared concerns about pay equity criminal justice access to health care and other issues. The ongoing protests about police violence and systemic racism encompass both communities as well — but the national focus has chiefly been about the impact on Black Americans and the ways white Americans are responding to it.  And while Latinos want people to understand how systemic racism in education housing and wealth affects them they are also grappling with an entrenched assumption that racism is a blackandwhite issue which can make it challenging to gain a foothold in the national conversation. They often find themselves frustrated and implicitly left out.  We are made to feel unwelcome here no matter what we’ve done or how long we’ve been here   said Cynthia Garcia 28 who attended the protest and whose parents immigrated from Mexico. As a child in Phoenix she said she regularly heard racist slurs aimed at her family and now hears the same words used against her own schoolage children. She said it was important to march both to  show up for ourselves and to say this is wrong.       We’ve always known that police brutality is a Black and brown issue a poor people’s issue   said Marisa Franco the executive director of Mijente a Latino civil rights group.  Right now it is imperative for nonBlack Latino communities to both empathize with Black people and also recognize that it is in our material interest to fundamentally change policing in this country   Ms. Franco said. In New York Los Angeles Atlanta Philadelphia and many other cities thousands of young Latinos have shown up to Black Lives Matter protests in recent weeks. Sometimes they speak only quietly about their own concerns of antiLatino racism. Other times they are more overt. In Phoenix activists wore face masks emblazoned with  Defund Police  — the last three letters marked in red to emphasize ICE Immigration and Customs Enforcement. An artist passed out a silkscreened Aztecstyle painting that showed a black jaguar and a brown tiger each blending into the other his own symbolism of the moment.     There’s no doubt that the AfricanAmerican community has borne the biggest brunt of police brutality but it’s also clear that Latinos have suffered as well   Mr Castro said in an interview.  There’s a kinship of experience as a community.  Yet illuminating and addressing discrimination faced by Latinos remains a challenge Mr Castro said. While many Americans at least learn the basic history of slavery and Jim Crow racism against Black people there remains a lack of fundamental knowledge about Latino history which can make it difficult to discuss how social policies have been harmful.  Many Americans don’t know exactly where you fit in   Mr Castro said. In conversations with her three children about race Alma Aguilar 31 has been clear about her own experience   We are not treated the same way as white people   she tells them.  People pretty much tend to attack us   said Ms. Aguilar who attended a small protest near her home in the Phoenix suburbs.  When my son grows up I don’t want him to be killed by a police officer because he looks a certain way because he’s a brown boy.  Even the term  brown  can oversimplify matters given that it is often used to describe people from multiple continents and different cultures whose skin color can range from ivory to sienna. It can also be used to refer to some people of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent. The opposite of a monolith Latinos include undocumented immigrants and those whose families have been in the United States for centuries. At a time when Mr Trump has made his antiimmigrant language and policies a centerpiece of his administration some Latinos — perhaps especially young ones — see themselves as part of a broader fight for racial equity.  Many Latino youth they are making the connection they are pressing their families to have difficult conversations   said Chris ZepedaMillán a professor of Chicano studies and public policy at the University of California Los Angeles. In one indication that Latinos are reacting to the current moment with urgency a recent poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that 21 percent of Hispanic voters said they had participated in Black Lives Matter protests nearly identical to the 22 percent of Black voters who said they had done so. But some activists have privately wondered whether the recent police killings of Latinos have received enough attention and whether there is broad acknowledgment that they too suffer from police brutality and systemic racism. Jonathan JayesGreen a longtime activist who in 2015 created UndocuBlack an organization designed to bring attention to issues of immigration and racial justice said he had seen a notable shift among Latinos both in their desire to protest and their willingness to confront racism among themselves.  AntiBlackness has deep and complicated roots throughout Latin America where fairskinned people are frequently viewed as the ideal and receive better treatment. And those views have often carried over to the United States where some believe that assimilation is the path to equality.  Historically we’ve tended to aspire to the American dream to aspire to whiteness   said Mr JayesGreen who is AfroLatino.  Latinos have a real active role to play in this fight. We can show that these fights are not separated and that we can be active conspirators in fights against antiBlackness.  Many liberal Latino activists have been pushing for huge changes in policing for years particularly in large urban centers. In many large cities there is a history of coalitions among Black and Latino community groups fighting for police overhauls with mixed success.  The police has always represented this outside force that could harm us   said Rafael Návar who said he was roughed up by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department as a teenager. But policing Mr Návar pointed out is only part of the struggle for Latinos who make up roughly 18 percent of the country’s population.  This is a huge moment to expand consciousness around our own community to recognize the contradiction of what kind of power do we and don’t we have in this country that despite our size we don’t even have basic needs met   Mr Návar said.  This country does not eat without our community yet the people doing the work can’t keep their own family safe. The lack of power has to make us ask  What kind of respect do we have  How do we organize to have dignity   Like several of his friends and cousins Victor Ortiz 22 attended protests daily for more than two weeks. Many of their parents are working in jobs that force them to leave their home during the pandemic.  So it’s like either way your family is at risk   he said.  It’s the same for Black folks we know that. We have to show up for each other.  Latinos hardly have the kind of deep political infrastructure that AfricanAmericans have built up over decades with many organizations working toward similar goals. Many liberal Latino activists view the Black Lives Matter movement and the current wave of protests as a model. Ysenia Lechuga 28 who brought a  tu lucha es mi lucha  sign to several recent demonstrations in Phoenix said she found Black activism  inspiring.   I can come here and preach about immigrants and all the issues that we go through   Ms. Lechuga said of attending the Black Lives Matter protests.  We get racially profiled we get beat down.  She thinks the current movement will have a  ripple effect  that will reach her community too.  Everything is going to start to change   she said. ,crimes

https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/05/opinion/only-the-guilty-are-guilty-not-their-sons.html,Only the Guilty Are Guilty  Not Their Sons,  Let me begin with a confession. I was wrong to believe that 50odd years after the most cruel of human tragedies caused by Hitler s Germany some passions had begun to cool. For the victims their children and their friends the wounds remain understandably raw. They still have nightmares and they are sensitive to certain words. They remember a time when the very word   German   evoked terror. I became aware that I was wrong when I read about the criticism of the United Jewish Appeal s decision to honor Thomas Middelhoff though it is the man Thomas Middelhoff who is being honored and not the Bertelsmann communications empire of which he is chief executive. The event to take place May 15 in New York will probably be picketed by demonstrators. Since I accepted the invitation to give the keynote address at the dinner I personally have been fielding complaints from people I know and respect and from others whom I have never met. The critics have voiced objections to what they perceive as an unduly hasty act of forgiveness. Some of these recriminations come from people who firmly believe that no German ought to be honored by Jews. Surely not now perhaps later though one letter writer told me   even a hundred years will be too soon   and condemned   Jewish leaders willing to prostitute themselves   for money. Another letter writer argued that just as I had pleaded with President Ronald Reagan in 1985 not to visit the German military cemetery in Bitburg because it contained SS graves I should not attend the   disgraceful event   for Mr Middelhoff. Thus Thomas Middelhoff born in 1953 a man who has never been accused of saying or doing anything to hurt or offend Jews and is in fact contributing to Jewish causes like the publication of Holocaust survivors  testimonies is being compared to the SS  I read this argument with disbelief. Of course Jews must never and will never forget the Jewish tragedy that marked the last century and will haunt all centuries to come. To forget would be a sin. To remember is essential it is a worthy endeavor a noble cause for which many of us have fought relentlessly. But does it justify intolerance  I know that to this day there are Jews and not only Holocaust survivors who refuse to set foot on German soil or even buy German cars. But to wish not to make Germany rich is one thing to treat all Germans as guilty is another. If tragically one chose to indict all Germans for the Holocaust that would inevitably lead to exclusion and discrimination. Jewish academies could never invite German intellectuals and scholars to their conferences Jewish music lovers would be expected to boycott concerts with German orchestras and Jews could never ever befriend Germans no matter how long after the war they were born. Over the years countless German personalities political figures scientists and artists have been singled out for a variety of awards by Jewish institutions of higher learning hospitals and charitable organizations in both Israel and the United States. Do all these institutions stand accused of forgetting or betraying the dead  Am I wrong to believe that to humiliate a German today just for having been born German and to boycott an evening for him is not what Jewish ethos is about  I would like to remind some of my fellow Jews that Hitler s Germany condemned all of us not for what we did or did not do but solely for having been born Jewish. We Jews do not believe in collective guilt. I have repeated over and over my belief that only the guilty are guilty  the children of killers are not killers but children. I know from my own experience with German students that their burden is at times difficult to carry heavy as it is with painful memories and questions about their fathers  and grandfathers  roles in the most terrifying genocide in history. Relations between Jews and Germans will remain traumatized for a long time. That is to be expected. Auschwitz and Treblinka will never be eradicated from German history. And yet hatred must never be an answer. It does not serve memory. ,crimes

George Pataki and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver who have been running Albany for years mostly in secret. But Mr Bruno is surely guilty of doing  nothing  to clean up the way New York s government does business. These are not happy days in Albany. The announcement of the FBI investigation into Mr Bruno s affairs one of several inquiries it appears follows the scandal involving Comptroller Alan Hevesi who used state workers to chauffeur and otherwise assist his wife as well as two indictments of lawmakers from New York City. And it also follows news that the state s lobbying commission has been looking into the relationship between Mr Bruno and a very wealthy friend Jared Abbruzzese. The FBI s inquiry will undoubtedly go on for some time but Mike McIntire s description of the BrunoAbbruzzese relationship in the Times has already reminded us of how shabbily taxpayers are treated by business as usual in Albany. Mr Bruno and Mr Abbruzzese have been friends for about seven years a friendship Mr Bruno says is based on their mutual love of horses but one that has clearly involved more than horses. In 2000 Mr Abbruzzese helped finance a company called Evident Technologies Inc. in Troy which is part of Mr Bruno s Senate district. In 2002 Mr Bruno sent the company  250 000 in state money as a grant and he arranged for another  250 000 grant in 2004. That same year Mr Abbruzzese s wife bought a plot of land for  90 000 from a partnership that included Mr Bruno. Since 2002 Mr Abbruzzese s companies have contributed more than  100 000 to Mr Bruno s campaign committees. And while he ended up losing money on the deal Mr Bruno invested in a company that was about to merge with one of Mr Abbruzzese s enterprises. Mr Abbruzzese has also invested in a group called Empire Racing Associates one of three operations competing to run the state s lucrative horse racing franchise. In an earlier round Empire came in second but Mr Bruno told reporters in Albany last week that he thinks all the contenders should be given another chance when the new governor comes into office. Meanwhile the state lobbying commission is investigating Mr Bruno s trips on Mr Abbruzzese s airplane. Mr Bruno is hardly alone in enjoying the loose rules on conflicts of interest in Albany. He is simply one more example albeit a dramatic one of Albany s cozy culture and one more reminder that Governorelect Eliot Spitzer has a lot of important housecleaning to do. ,crimes

America can be proud   said Senator Lindsey Graham one of the bill’s architects. Unfortunately Mr Graham was wrong. One of the many problems with the new law is that it will only make it harder than it already is to separate the real terrorists from the far larger group of inmates at Guantánamo Bay who were bit players in the Taliban or innocent bystanders. Mr Graham and other supporters of this dreadful legislation seem to have forgotten that American justice does not merely deliver swift punishment to the guilty. It also protects the innocent. Mr Bush ignored that fact after 9 11 when he tried to put the prisoners of the war on terror beyond the reach of American law and the Geneva Conventions. For starters he dispensed with one of the vital provisions of the conventions  that prisoners must be screened by a  competent tribunal  if there is any doubt about who they are and what role they played in hostilities. As a result hundreds of men captured in Afghanistan and other countries were sent to Guantánamo Bay and other prisons including the network of illegal CIA detention camps without any attempt to determine whether they were any sort of combatant legal or illegal. The Bush administration showed not the slightest interest in fixing this problem until the Supreme Court said in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld that the president cannot simply lock up anyone — even a foreign citizen — without giving him a real chance to challenge his detention before a  neutral decision maker.  In response Mr Bush created Combatant Status Review Tribunals which gave the most cursory possible reviews of the Gitmo detainees. These reviews took place years after the prisoners were captured. They permitted the use of hearsay evidence evidence obtained through coercion and even torture and evidence that was kept secret from the prisoner. The normal burden of proof was reversed  the tribunals presumed prisoners were justifiably detained and the prisoners had the burden of disproving government evidence — presuming they knew what it was in the first place. The new law leaves this mockery of justice stronger. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 makes it virtually impossible to contest a status tribunal’s decision. It prohibits claims of habeas corpus — the ancient right of prisoners in just societies to have their detentions reviewed — or any case based directly or indirectly on the Geneva Conventions. Even if an appeal got to the single appeals court now authorized to hear it the administration would very likely argue that it cannot be heard without jeopardizing secrets as it has done repeatedly. The new law dangerously expands the definition of illegal enemy combatant and allows Mr Bush — and the secretary of defense — to give to anyone they choose the authority to designate a prisoner as an illegal combatant. It also allows Mr Bush to go on squirreling prisoners away at secret CIA camps where none of the rules apply. Mr Bush wants Americans to trust him to apply these powers only to truly dangerous men. Even if our system were based on that sort of personal power and not the rule of law it would be hard to trust the judgment of a president and an administration whose records are so bad. The United States has yet to acknowledge that it kidnapped an innocent Canadian citizen and sent him to be abused in a Syrian prison. In another case a German citizen has accused the United States of grabbing him off the streets of Macedonia drugging him and sending him to Afghanistan where he was brutally treated. Then there is the Ethiopian living in London who said he was grabbed by American agents and brutalized by Moroccan torturers until he confessed to plotting with Jose Padilla to set off a  dirty bomb.  Mr Padilla was never charged with the crime. The Ethiopian remains at Guantánamo Bay. Republicans who support the new law like to point out that it only covers foreigners. But Americans have never believed that human rights are just for Americans. Our nation is outraged when an authoritarian government jails an American or one of its own citizens on trumpedup charges and brings him or her before a phony court.

https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/25/archives/guilty-is-guilty-insane-or-not.html,Guilty Is Guilty  Insane or Not,  CHESHIRE Conn. — Is a person responsible for his behavior if he is insane or brainwashed  Legislative and judicial proceedings answer no. To this 1 say that there is no substitute for personal accountabilty and nothing more dangerous for society than to allow a person regardless of his state of mind to escape the consequences of his actions. Consider murder trials in which the accused have pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Admitted killers have literally gotten away with murder — legally. The insanity plea allowed fudges to sentence them to mental hospitals for observation and treatment. There they were found sane and released because they can t be tried twice for the same crime. It is legislative insanity that this should be allowed to happen  In a free society laws are made to control behavior not states of mind. A defendant s mental state should have no bearing on whether he is found ‘Criminals have been handed legal means to get away with murder and they . . . quite reasonably use it’ guilty of committing a crime. He may be insane brainwashed or even as in Son of Sam‐type cases  possessed  by an evil demon  though  Son   David R. Berkowitz now denies it  but that should only be taken into account after the finding. If a person is genuinely unbalanced he can be given prison sentence that includes appropriate treatment to restore mental health whether the treatment be psychiatry deprogramming or exorcism. Then if treatment is successful the person should serve the rest of his sentence unless the preponderance of expert ‘opinion feels that pardon or commutation is in order. At that point compassion becomes proper — but not before. The legal system is intended to deliver justice not compassion. Ignor ing this crucial distinction has led to the shameful and dangerous situation in which admitted murderers are released into society without punishment and without even simple justice for the victim s survivors. We can agree that Jim Jones was insane but does that mean that if he had lived he should have been found not guilty by reason of insanity  Or Adolf Eichmann  The Nuremberg trials declared loud and clear that people must be responsible for their acts even in time of war. Trials in America today however. declare that people are not responsible for their acts because their state of mind excluded reason. Consequently. criminals have been handed legal means to get away with murder and they considering their lives are at stake quite reasonably use it. Legislators should correct this most gross miscarriage of justice — a miscarriage based on the foolish idea that your state of mind has a bearing on your innocence or guilt in criminal proceedings. If you did it you re guilty — period. Whether you remember doing it or whether you could make rational decision at the time doesn t matter at that point in the proceedings. Your state of mind and other possible mitigating circumstances should be taken into account only in passing sentence. Irresponsible behavior can never be condoned to Vie point of mur‐ der. The failure of legislators to recognize and correct this outrageous situation only contributes to the general deterioration of respect for law and so ,crimes

It is anything we want to keep to ourselves. It is what we work hard to own but don t admit to. It s a cheerleader movie or better yet a comic book. It s a round restaurant that rotates a trampoline ice cream with sprinkles chick lit spike heels. It s almost every single one of Andy Warhol s obsessions.

Mod rags at Marc Jacobs. Knickers at Ralph Lauren. But it s not as though we re ignoring what s going on in the world. It s just that we need a respite.

https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/23/magazine/lives-guilty-as-charged.html,LIVES  Guilty as Charged, LIVES  I last saw my brother Paul in 1995 at a Dairy Queen in Tennessee. He was about to go to prison. He had been arrested for sexually assaulting boys who lived in his neighborhood. They were all under 12. We ate dinner and lingered over icecream sundaes. Mom couldn t look at him. Dad seemed old and defeated. I kissed Paul goodbye figuring I would see him once more and we d sort it all out. But he never explained himself I still don t know his side of the story. Paul joined the Army when he was 19 and I was 3. He came home every few years for the holidays. When he did he would pick me up and bonk my head on the ceiling. He did it to our dog too. I didn t particularly like it but he always laughed. The only thing I knew about him as a child was his favorite color  skyblue pink. He said it was the color of a sunset when the pink clouds were breaking up and you could see some sky. When I was 12 my brother was transferred to Germany and we had a family picture taken before he left. At 6foot4 Paul towered over all of us. He was very skinny and had been losing his blond hair since he was a teenager. The rest of us had dark hair. Except for his ears sticking out from his round head just like Dad s he didn t look like anyone in our family. All four kids had the same crooked smile though. On a minister s salary my father couldn t afford braces. I cried when Paul left for Heidelberg but only because Mom did. When Dad sent him packages he always asked us to include something. Dad would buy Armygreen socks Hydrox cookies and playing cards and write a letter signing our names. I d get my crayons sit at the diningroom table and color a sheet of paper blue and then pink until the colors blended together and add it to the box. I have a photo of Paul in his apartment in Heidelberg with a page of skyblue pink taped to the wall. I was 16 when he left the Army. When he got home at 3 in the morning he stood in my room and cried because I wasn t a little girl anymore. As the youngest I was his last chance to have a kid sister he had missed my sisters  childhoods but he was determined to be there for me. We swapped music and went to every movie that came to our small Ohio town. He even taught me to drive a stickshift transmission in his brandnew Escort. We were on a road trip when he told me he was gay. He was relieved that I wasn t shocked. He said it made it easier for him to face our sisters. When I started a master s program in theater he moved to Tennessee and I d stop there on my way home to see our parents. He took me dancing and I met his friends. We would gossip about men. My sisters never understood what made us so close. It was harder for them to get over the years he hadn t been there. Without any sibling history and the hurt and grudges that entails Paul and I had no preconceived ideas about who the other person was. So for years after he went to prison I kept asking myself Did he really hurt those boys  I d think maybe they got mad at him and lied. Maybe the fact that he had male pinups on his bedroom walls upset their parents. I thought it would all get cleared up at the trial but there wasn t one. Paul pleaded no contest and was sentenced to eight years. He would be eligible for parole in four. I was the only one who didn t think he was guilty. I figured that he had had a bad lawyer or that a gay man couldn t get a fair trial in Tennessee. I would have believed anything to keep my brother from being a monster. Dad sent my brother packages again  this time from Florida where my parents had moved   canned sardines letters and long johns and stamps to use as currency. Paul wrote back asking for a stereo and cigarettes sounding like a teenager who had been grounded. He never apologized for the shame he brought to our family. My grandmother who lived in Florida too never understood why Paul didn t come for Christmas anymore. When she died we told my cousins in Ohio that he was   working for the state   and couldn t get time off for her funeral. In Paul s last letter to me he complained about being transferred to a new facility that wasn t going to be good for his social life all smiley faces and innuendo. I didn t respond. He wasn t remorseful. He never asked how Dad was holding up and his selfishness angered me. I was tired of being the only one who believed he was innocent. I started listening to what the rest of the family thought. The court had ordered him to undergo counseling as part of his sentence but he told us he was never provided with any. When he was up for parole in 2001 I considered writing the prison to say he hadn t been rehabilitated so they should keep him. But I couldn t do that to him. Now that he s out my sisters don t allow him in their homes. My parents don t talk about him in front of each other because it is too upsetting. Paul asks for me every time he calls home. Dad told him that I had moved to New York and would contact him when I was ready. I don t know when that will be. I don t want to think about it anymore but I do every sunset. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/smarter-living/guilty-pleasures-no-such-thing.html,‘Guilty’ Pleasures? No Such Thing, Go forth and read that trashy novel.   Yes these are our guilty pleasures — what some people consider the junk food in our media diets. But if we enjoy them why should we feel guilty  We should be free to enjoy whatever we like  And as it turns out these socalled  guilty  pleasures can actually be good for us so long as they’re enjoyed in moderation.  When we rest we think we’re supposed to use that time productively with problem solving   said Dr. Kristin Neff an associate professor in the department of Educational Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. While  that may be good for survival   Dr. Neff said constantly running through hypothetical problems  is not very good for happiness.  Taking a mental break and enjoying something that doesn’t require intense intellectual focus gets us out of problemsolving mode added Robin Nabi a professor of communication at the University of California Santa Barbara who specializes in media effects and emotion. It can also improve our ability to productively deal with stressors and help us engage more positively with other people. If that’s true then why do guilty pleasures get such a bad rap  Well it’s not the indulgences themselves but the attitudes we use when talking about them. According to experts like Dr. Nabi feeling guilty about or disparaging activities we enjoy can diminish the benefits they offer us. But shedding selfimposed embarrassment about our interests can be empowering and enrich our social lives which is why it’s time to ditch  guilty pleasure  from our collective vocabulary. Because it’s often used in a winking way the term  guilty pleasure  feels innocent like a joke we’re proving we’re in on. But if that joke is about something that brings us genuine joy and isn’t harming anyone then what’s the punch line   A guilty pleasure is something that we enjoy but we know we’re either not supposed to like or that liking it says something negative about us   said Sami Schalk an assistant professor of gender and women’s studies at the University of WisconsinMadison.  That negative thing often ends up being an association with categories of identity we disparage and marginalize in society   according to Dr. Schalk. Consider what separates sports and reality TV. The idea of someone apologizing for watching the N.B.A. finals sounds silly but the implied apology when someone says  Ugh I know ‘The Bachelor is awful but I can’t stop watching it  is normalized. The type of audience targeted according to experts can play into why certain types of entertainment escape the guilty pleasure label. Eliminating  guilty pleasure  from our vocabulary and debunking the myth that the frivolous things we like reflect poorly on us is useful in resisting false notions about who pleasure is for and who has a right to pursue it said Adrienne Maree Brown the author of  Pleasure Activism  The Politics of Feeling Good.  Though the terms guilt and shame are often used interchangeably they mean different things and neither really fits our conception of what a guilty pleasure is. Guilt can be a healthy motivator to push us to change behaviors we don’t like while shame — the painful feeling that our behavior makes us horrible people — is never productive. But when we disparage our reality TV viewing habits for example we typically aren’t describing a behavior we hope to change nor are we saying we’re terrible people.  When you feel guilty but haven’t harmed anyone then you’re just in the realm of perfectionism or criticism   said Dr. Neff the associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin.  Beyond the fear about how others will perceive us Dr. Schalk said this perfectionism stems from the  deeply puritanical roots  of our culture one in which pleasure is seen  as sinful and bad and selfindulgent.  Despite the societal message that pleasure is something that is earned  there’s a reason why our bodies literally at the nerve level are wired to feel pleasure   Ms. Brown said. For her pleasure activism is about combating the oppressive idea that pleasure isn’t a natural part of everyday life. She suggested asking  Why do I feel so much shame around this if it’s not causing harm to me or anyone else    Though these benefits have yet to be studied long term and our problems don’t magically disappear once we turn off the TV rest can reduce stress levels. Perhaps more important  your perception of your ability to handle it improves   Dr. Nabi said.   Having something else to do besides problem solving is really healthy for us   Dr. Neff said. She described how  flow states   like meditating playing sports and yes consuming media can help our brains rest and recover by providing a reprieve from problemsolving mode.  We have this cultural value of media consumption being edifying and that what we do should be about growing and achieving   Dr. Nabi said.  We don’t focus as much on relaxation and playing and enjoyment and fun and these are such important aspects of being a human being.  Still it’s best to follow the ageold advice our parents taught us  Everything in moderation.  Ms. Brown said that  embracing our common human need for pleasure is not about hedonism.  She added that too much of a good thing is of course never a good thing which is why understanding and accepting what brings us pleasure is crucial to finding that balance. Perhaps the most important value of a guilty pleasure is the bond it can create between people.  These shows are out there for a reason — they’re resonating   Dr. Nabi said. Dr. Neff added that the connections we make with others who share our interests in such things  is not to be underestimated.  Besides helping us connect with others talking about what we enjoy can alleviate any residual guilt and make it easier to discover more things that bring us pleasure.  Being able to talk openly about what we love is more than just a way to spend the time. After all Ms. Brown said   If you don’t feel like you can be honest about what TV pleases you then what else are you keeping from yourself and others   ,crimes

https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/arts/video-games/q-and-a-rockstars-dan-houser-on-grand-theft-auto-v.html,Americana at Its Most Felonious,   With Grand Theft Auto V the first major title in the series in five years coming out next spring Rockstar seems more eager than it has been in the past to talk about itself and the maturation of its work. Rather than being inspired solely by gangster films and TV shows like  Miami Vice   the Grand Theft Auto games now try to capture albeit in heightened form aspects of contemporary life. The new game set in a fictionalized Los Angeles called Los Santos tackles the aftermath of the credit crunch and the housing crisis for three criminals each of whom is playable.  Previously the games focused on a protagonist.  Yet it’s still Grand Theft Auto  In a demo version one character pours a ring of gasoline around a truck and lights it on fire. During a recent conversation in SoHo Dan Houser Rockstar’s head writer and vice president for creative — as well as the brother of the studio president Sam Houser — spoke about what he and Rockstar are trying to achieve with Grand Theft Auto V how his EnglishmaninNewYork status informs his writing and whether he thinks the studio has changed with time. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.   Books tell you something movies show you something games let you do something. Openworld games have an enormous strength creatively. As well as letting you do something — run around fly a helicopter be the hero be the antihero whatever — they also let you be in the world passively. So we’ve taken some of the things the director used to control within the movie and handed it to you as the consumer of the medium. We have a vision for what we think interactive entertainment can become and each time we get closer to realizing those ambitions.           My brother and I have a certain perspective as people from London who then moved to New York. But the guys in Scotland at our Rockstar North studio they have a different perspective as people who never lived here. And then Lazlow Jones who writes a lot of the satire with me is a good ol’ boy from Oklahoma. The games have always been in some ways a British response to Americana rather than America. But it’s not just that.               ,crimes

https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/us/felonious-and-urbane-dillinger-still-charms.html,Felonious and Urbane  Dillinger Still Charms,  On a steamy night 70 years ago the debonair bank robber John Dillinger who had reached a level of fame equaled only by Charles Lindbergh and Franklin Roosevelt stepped out of the Biograph Theater in Chicago and was shot to death by FBI agents who were waiting in ambush. . To observe the anniversary of his death a band of historians crime buffs and others met Thursday night at a tavern near the Biograph. Shortly before 10 30 the hour at which Dillinger and two female companions emerged after seeing the gangster film   Manhattan Melodrama    the group walked to the alleyway where his killers had laid their trap. As the plaintive strains of   Amazing Grace   wafted from a bagpipe Robert Ritholz an amateur historian and artifact collector solemnly poured a can of beer onto the ground at the spot where Dillinger fell. Later Mike Flores a theater director who has immersed himself in Dillinger lore said the shooting had touched off a public frenzy.   Within minutes after he died these streets were filled with thousands of people    Mr Flores said.   No one could get in or out not even ambulances. People were dipping their handkerchiefs in his blood. He was like a rock star.   Although Indiana lays a claim to him because he was born there and although he robbed banks in at least five states in his 13month crime spree Dillinger returned time and again to Chicago. Many people here are still in thrall to his memory. The contradictions of Dillinger who was beloved by many ordinary people even as law enforcement agents relentlessly pursued him still have a hold on the American imagination. Several new works seek to capture the contradictions of this charming bandit. A new biography appeared in May and a heavily documented study of the gangster era of the 1930 s when Dillinger flourished was published this month. Half a dozen films have been made about him and several more are in various stages of development. The Chicagoborn playwright David Mamet who specializes in dissecting the criminal psyche has written the screenplay for one of them. Dillinger burst into the public imagination at a time when American institutions seemed to be collapsing. Many people were especially angry at banks so by robbing them Dillinger took on the aura of a Robin Hood. Newspapers across the Midwest printed letters from his admirers full of praise for a man who   robbed those who became rich by robbing the poor   and who   isn t half as cheap as a crooked banker or crooked politician.   Some people in this part of the country still feel that way.   He did steal money    said Tom Pyplatz a businessman who this week visited the John Dillinger Museum in Hammond Ind.   But he gave a lot of it away to very poor people.   Among the museum s treasures are the trousers Dillinger was wearing when he was killed and his original tombstone which had to be replaced at his grave site in Indianapolis in 1958 because souvenir hunters had chipped so many pieces from it. In Chicago more than 50 sites have been conclusively tied to him or members of his gang including the Barrel o Fun Tavern where Dillinger first met his girlfriend Evelyn Frechette and two bordellos run by Anna Sage the madam who later betrayed him. Sage who accompanied Dillinger on his fatal trip to the Biograph and wore a reddishcolored dress as a signal to FBI agents went down in history as the   lady in red.   A fullsize statue of her now sits in the original ticket booth at the Biograph. The building was sold this week to the Victory Gardens theater company which will build two stages inside while preserving the classic Art Deco facade.   That statue makes her look a lot better than she actually did    said Richard Crowe a Chicago tour guide who became fascinated with Dillinger while attending DePaul University a few blocks away. Mr Crowe is one of a number of Chicagoans who collect Dillinger memorabilia. He owns a handwritten Dillinger letter which he says has doubled in value since he bought it seven years ago. Now he is negotiating with the family of a bystander who was wounded in the ambush hoping to buy the bullet that was removed from her body. Dillinger was robbing banks at a time when flamboyant criminals were much in the news but Bryan Burrough author of   Public Enemies  America s Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI 193334    said he was by far the most popular.   Part of it had to do with his personality    Mr Burrough said.   He really had grace under pressure. He was known for little bits of courtesy especially toward women. He would josh and joke during bank robberies. It was the way he did things. He had obvious charisma obvious star power.   The other reason is that he carried on this extended catandmouse game with the police and always seemed to be able to outsmart them. When he was caught he d give interviews and tell this very appealing sob story about being a poor Indiana boy who went wrong and then he d escape in some spectacular way. People loved him for it.   Dary Matera author of the new biography   John Dillinger  The Life and Death of America s First Celebrity Criminal    says that Dillinger   lives forever in a way no other criminal before or since has even approached.     He s on that island with Elvis Marilyn Monroe and President Kennedy    Mr Matera said   the place for people who never die.   ,crimes

The day after a Federal judge sentenced Union City Mayor William V. Musto to seven years in prison for racketeering and extortion residents elected him to four more years at City Hall. The Mayor s supporters called the results a   repudiation   of Federal prosecutors who had charged Mr Musto and other officials with conspiring to share almost  500 000 in bribes and kickbacks from local construction projects. The victory though might not enable the 65yearold politician to keep the job he has held for most of the last two decades. Superior Court Judge Thomas S. O Brien said a state law barring persons convicted of offenses   involving dishonesty   from public office appeared to apply to Mr Musto   on it s face    but delayed action until a hearing next month on the statute s constitutionality. As for Mr Musto s other post as State Senator an appeals court last week rejected his efforts to block Trenton colleagues from declaring his seat vacant. The New Jersey Supreme Court is expected to consider the matter this week. In Newark meanwhile Kenneth A. Gibson who is seeking a fourth term as Mayor and his chief rival in the field of four City Council President Earl Harris both have been indicted on charges of appointing a former councilman to a noshow job. Last week Mr Gibson won but since he got less than half the vote will face Mr Harris in a June runoff. Among the City Council races former State Assemblyman Anthony Imperiale who once lost a mayoral election to Mr Gibson and was recently appointed Director of the State Office of Community Safety by Governor Kean qualified for a runoff for one of four atlarge seats. And voters by a wide margin endorsed a switch from an appointed school board to an elected one. In Atlantic City where residents decided last year to change from a commission form of government to one with an elected mayor Assemblyman Michael J. Matthews won a narrow victory but faces a runoff with James L. Usry an assistant school superintendent. Mr Usry had proposed that the city s airport be closed and the land used for housing Mr Matthews argued that the airport was vital to the casinos. Carlyle C. Douglas and Richard Levine ,crimes

This was how a protest against racism and police violence that began peacefully was ended by the police just minutes later.  There’s pandemonium. There’s yelling there’s screaming. I realize like I have to get off of this hill. I can’t breathe at all.   coughing and screaming  Protests have spread across the US after George Floyd was killed while in police custody. And in some cases rather than deescalating officers responded with force in violation of their own guidelines on crowd control and the use of lessthanlethal weapons. That was the case at the protest in Philadelphia which was documented from all angles by protesters journalists and even helicopters overhead.  sirens  This wealth of evidence presents a detailed picture of how crowdcontrol tactics — in this case with pepper spray and tear gas — can be misused or even abused causing injuries and inflaming tensions even more.  screaming   Black lives matter  Black lives matter  Black lives matter   It’s Monday June 1 the third day of demonstrations in Philadelphia. More than a thousand protesters begin marching. Shortly before 5 p.m. some of them enter the I676 highway. They’re disrupting traffic on a major road and some are vandalizing the area giving the police cause to intervene. But we don’t see any signs of violence.  The people in front kind of signaled to all the cars to stop slow down. The cars were like honking in support of us.   cars honking  The protesters move towards this tunnel and soon two SWAT teams arrive at the front and rear of the march. Their aim is to clear the road and to assist a state trooper who’s also at the scene. Philadelphia police initially claim the trooper was trapped in his car and threatened by protesters. But we can clearly see his empty vehicle and the car’s dashcam footage released several weeks later shows that police radio traffic refers to the protesters as  peaceful.  The trooper had actually been able to leave freely and join the SWAT team contradicting accounts by the city police. All we see is a marcher spraypainting the empty car.  shouting and screaming  The first SWAT team comes in from the east side through the tunnel. People panic and the situation escalates as seen from the ground and overhead. Part of the SWAT team pushes the marchers out of the tunnel using pepper spray.  There was like two or three SWAT cops and they were just  spraying sounds  to anyone who was in front. There wasn’t any verbal warning. There wasn’t any like ‘Yo you guys need to evacuate.’   Officers target people walking away from them or filming the scene. Then the second SWAT team moves in from the other side with an armored vehicle.  She goes right underneath the  inaudible  bro.  Protesters are now wedged in between two police teams. Most try to comply with the officers and look for ways to leave the scene. Some escape. Others get trapped.  Honestly people were just trying to get away. There wasn’t any kind of verbal warning. There wasn’t any pushing with shields. There wasn’t any pushing with bikes. There was no megaphone. There was nothing  It was weapons. Weapons were the first warning. That’s it.  We spoke with this man who was peppersprayed in the face by the second SWAT team after sitting in the middle of the highway.  screaming   When I sat down immediately two women ran and sat down in front of me. And I’m assuming they did this because they were protecting me.  When a tear gas canister landed near him he thought of the women sitting nearby.  I couldn’t let them get hurt for something I chose to do. All right this was my decision. So I picked up the tear gas. I threw it back not directly at the cop but just — just away. And then I immediately immediately sat back down crossed my legs. He walks up to the girl in front sprays her pulls her mask down. The girl next to her  sprays her. I hear a spray. He pushes me sprays me sprays me continuously. I could not see. I could barely breathe.  Police guidelines state that pepper spray should not be used on disorderly crowds or peaceful protesters only on specific people acting violently.  sirens  Next as one group of marchers leaves the highway and climbs this small hill we see an egregious misuse of tear gas. At this point you can see the highway is clear and traffic is flowing. This is crucial. Protesters had clearly complied with police and were trying to leave the freeway a finding that directly contradicts how the police would characterize what happened.  The option of deploying tear gas was selected when it became evident at that time other options were not effective.  But the protesters get stuck at a dead end.  When the cops came from both sides underneath the bridges if you hadn’t already left like as soon as cops showed up there was really nowhere to go.  The only escape route  climbing a large fence and wall at the end of a hill. Behind them is the highway. And that’s where pepperspraying police officers and the state trooper are pinning them in. A local videographer named Sunny Singh who runs a website called hate5six films the scene.  screaming and shouting  The intent of tear gas is dispersal but if the gas is used in a space with no easy exit people can’t move away. At that exact moment other footage shows that an officer actually directs people up the hill into the crowds trapped in tear gas.  coughing  The police later said they had also fired white smoke to reduce the impact of the tear gas but the effects are still strong. According to a health and human rights expert who reviewed the videos the protesters risk being injured in a stampede. They also risk excessive exposure to tear gas and chemical burns.  bang   All I see is tear gas and people scrambling to escape.  Drew Underwood was on the hill that day.  I pull out my phone because I’m like nobody is going to believe if I told this story like what is actually happening. And so as I panned back to my left with my camera I immediately felt —   smack    — something hit me. I got hit in the face.  Underwood believes he was hit in the face by a projectile fired by the police which scarred his cheek.  I did nothing to deserve this wound on my face. The other people that were shot that were teargassed they did nothing deserving of that trauma but we have to live with it.  As the protest winds down police shoot projectiles at onlookers standing above the highway —  shooting  — and detain some of the remaining protesters dragging them down the hill. After the protest Philadelphia police gave their view of what happened on June 1.  When folks run up on a freeway — at that point it’s not deemed peaceful.  Officers justified their use of force by treating every single person on the highway as violent. A statement from the mayor said that police were authorized to use tear gas  when absolutely necessary in violent situations — if and only if — lesser methods did not stop the violent behavior.  After weeks of tension the city announced an independent investigation into the overall police response to the protests. Our own analysis of the June 1 incident found that it wasn’t violent and that police SWAT teams violated protocols by using force on cornered protesters as they were trying to leave the march.  shouting   Give her a hand  Give her a hand  Give her a hand    I need help. I can’t —   OK feet up. Lift one foot up. One foot.   Officials in Philadelphia on Thursday announced a moratorium on the use of tear gas in the city and apologized for their response to a June 1 protest against police brutality.

A Massachusetts man has been charged with sending emails that contained threats of violence and racial slurs to Danielle Outlaw the police commissioner in Philadelphia during the city’s protests over the death of George Floyd the authorities said on Tuesday. The man Peter Fratus of West Dennis Mass. used a Gmail account to send two messages to the Police Department email address of Commissioner Outlaw who is AfricanAmerican on June 6 amid some of the largest protests across the nation over police misconduct a criminal complaint said. The first message which was sent at 11 18 p.m. Eastern time threatened to hang black people and also contained antiSemitic references to the Holocaust the complaint said. The second message sent one minute later had a racial slur in the subject line and said in the body  Where does police chief live    according to the complaint. Mr Fratus 38 was identified two days later as the person who sent the messages said the authorities who subpoenaed his internet provider address from Comcast and Apple. He admitted when he was interviewed by the authorities that he had sent the messages and had  crossed the line   the complaint said. William M. McSwain the US attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania said in a statement on Tuesday that the threats were vile and disturbing.  We take such threats very seriously   Mr McSwain said  and let this be a warning to anyone who might feel the urge to fire off an online threat directed at a public official  We will trace your digital footprint track you down and hold you accountable.  Mr Fratus was charged with transmitting a threat across state lines which carries a maximum possible penalty of up to five years in prison and a  250 000 fine. He appeared in US District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday and was being held in custody until a detention hearing on Friday. The federal public defender’s office in Massachusetts which represented Mr Fratus did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is expected to be transferred to US District Court in Philadelphia. It was not the first time that Mr Fratus had made threats toward a public official according to prosecutors who wrote in a detention motion filed on Wednesday that Mr Fratus had a history of threatening and assaultive behavior directed at law enforcement officers politicians and other people because of their race gender or religion. He was convicted of assaulting a police officer in Massachusetts last year and was sentenced to 90 days in jail wrote prosecutors who noted that Mr Fratus is on probation. In 2018 he left a phone message for an AfricanAmerican congresswoman who was not named calling her racial slurs and threatening to lynch her if she did not go back to Africa the motion said. No charges were filed in that episode. He also has a disorderly conduct conviction stemming from a tirade at a business owned by a PalestinianAmerican in 2016 according to the motion.

The nastiest piece of work  the designation is entirely relative  is Knuck  Matt Nable  the newly sprung president of a motorcycle gang whose stint in the slammer has left him with a taste for rape and a bloodthirsty need to reclaim his territory. His smarter deputy — again relative — Paddo  Ryan Corr  has set up a mutually beneficial moneylaundering deal with a rival gang threatening Knuck’s supremacy. And because few things are more volatile than an emasculated thug we guess it won’t be long before mattresses and ammunition are at the top of everyone’s shopping list. Directing his first feature  from a screenplay by Nable  Stephen McCallum fashions an unremittingly vicious leatherandink slugfest whose women are just as distasteful as its men. The movie’s misogyny is baked into its stereotypes — like the decorative viperish enabler and the drugdependent plaything — unmitigated by a late power flip that feels tacked on. Also problematic is Mark’s simpleminded brother  Josh McConville  whose persistent screwups precipitate much of the violence yet whose character remains no more than a sketch. Oppressively mirthless  Outlaws  can nevertheless be enjoyed after a fashion as a surreal tapestry of macho garbling.  Rules   Mumblemumble    goes an early exchange.  Bitches   Mumblesnortsneer .

https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/books/review/caravaggio-the-artist-as-outlaw.html,'Caravaggio': The Artist as Outlaw,  CARAVAGGIO Painter of Miracles. By Francine Prose. Illustrated. 149 pp. Atlas Books HarperCollins Publishers.  21.95. ALL evidence suggests that Michelangelo Merisi street brawler gang member murderer and the great painter known as Caravaggio was quick to anger. Consider the episode of the fried artichokes. The whole thing sounds like a joke. Caravaggio had ordered eight artichokes for lunch four fried in oil and the rest in butter. When the artichokes arrived at his table Caravaggio asked which ones were fried in oil. The waiter suggested not unreasonably that he smell them. Instead Caravaggio threw the whole plate of artichokes in the waiter s face and reached for a sword. It s one thing to throw artichokes at waiters and quite another to throw rocks at police officers Caravaggio s next offense according to the Roman police logs. And then there was the little matter of the tennis game gone awry. We all know that tennis can be frustrating but Caravaggio s game ended with the murder of his opponent. The atmosphere of such episodes as Francine Prose notes in her racy intensely imagined and highly readable account of Caravaggio s unsurprisingly curtailed life he died in 1610 at the age of 39 seems drawn from the plays of the artist s contemporary Shakespeare and so does the  theatrical compassionate alternately and simultaneously comic and tragic  spirit of Caravaggio s extraordinary paintings. With his short life and shorter fuse Caravaggio is a tantalizing subject for a brief biography. He is a major figure  the best known painter in all of Italy  at the time of his death whose stature has only increased in our time with an almost nonexistent paper trail. No letters or preparatory drawings have come to light. What we know of his activities and associates comes as Prose remarks largely from  police reports legal depositions court transcripts . . . and contracts for commissions   supplemented by malicious gossip and the sniping of rivals. A novelist s tools are as necessary here as a biographer s  an imaginative reconstruction of events a credible portrayal of Caravaggio himself. And Prose a superb novelist and occasional art critic has provided both. Caravaggio s life she notes  is the closest thing we have to the myth of the sinnersaint   a myth that  in these jaded and secular times we are almost ashamed to admit that we still long for and need.  And then there are the amazing paintings themselves  the slightly dazed homoerotic evocations of a young John the Baptist snuggling with a horny old ram the debauched childgod Bacchus the seductive lute player. In a very different key dramatically staged and lighted are the  you are there  biblical scenes  St. Matthew summoned from his countinghouse to a different life.  Who me   he seems to say. Or St. Paul lying dazed on his back on the road to Damascus his horse looming dangerously above him.  His raised hoof won t crush his thrown rider   Prose writes  not even if he has to hold it like that for a lifetime.  Prose s Caravaggio is an artist of intensity and transgression requiring in both art and life an almost violent sense of the real   Matthew s rough meat hook of a hand  or the shockingly  bloated corpse  of the dead Madonna. Prose whose  Lives of the Muses  convincingly explored moments of reinvention in the lives of male artists inspired by women is particularly good on the nature of conversion both in the paintings of Matthew and Paul and in the artist himself for whom each painting represented  a frozen glimpse of forever  amid  the terror of revelation.  As an art critic Prose is a bit of a street brawler herself. She swaggers among her rivals like Mercutio spoiling for a fight. Contemplating Caravaggio s bizarre queasy selfportrait as  Sick Bacchus   Prose claims that  few critics have bothered to point out the obvious  how deeply strange the painting is.  But she has learned a lot from those few and one wishes she were a little more gracious to the art historians who bolster her arguments. She chides the naïveté of  many of these academic and literary conversations  about Caravaggio s sexual proclivities but when she says quite accurately that  sex between men in Caravaggio s time was viewed very differently than it is today   those academic conversations are why she knows this. theless Prose brings to Caravaggio a fresh and unflinching eye. Her pages on his final months as he flees across Italy to Naples and then astonishingly to Malta pursued by a partly phantasmal posse of papal guards Maltese knights and Roman street toughs have some of the intensity of Caravaggio s own claustrophobic final works set in  dark crypts and bleak rooms.  An early biographer s words on Caravaggio s last journey could serve as the painter s epitaph   Bad luck did not abandon him.  Or as Prose handsomely sums it up   Having spent his brief tragic and turbulent life painting miracles he managed in the process to create one the miracle of art the miracle of the way in which some paint a few brushes a square of canvas together with that most essential ingredient genius can produce something stronger than time and age more powerful than death.

https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/opinion/vanessa-barbara-brazil-the-outlaws-paradise.html,Brazil  the Outlaw’s Paradise,  SÃO PAULO Brazil — A longestablished piece of wisdom in Hollywood says that if you have robbed a bank or sold war secrets to the enemy or even if you’ve just embezzled some company funds then you should pack your stuff and move to Brazil. According to my brief detective work perhaps the first film to reference the peculiar attraction that Brazil holds for international runaways was  The Lavender Hill Mob   a 1951 British comedy starring Alec Guinness. His character steals one million pounds in gold from the Bank of England melts the bars into miniature Eiffel Towers and comes  straight on to Rio de Janeiro. Gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease.  A year later the Hollywood drama  5 Fingers  presented an ambitious British Embassy valet who decides to sell secrets to the Nazis. James Mason’s character intends to collect 200 000 pounds in 12 weeks and then dash into  a new life. A new name.  Alongside his partner a ruined countess portrayed by Danielle Darrieux he plans to escape  the wars the intrigues fears   and to become like the elegant man he once saw on the balcony of a Brazilian villa high in the mountainside above the harbor.  He seemed close enough to touch and yet he was beyond the reach of anyone.  It’s not surprising that so many fictional stories revolve around characters fleeing here to escape the law. Today Brazil does have an extradition treaty with the United States but it has been in effect only since 1964. We had no similar treaty with Britain until 1997 thus allowing Ronald Biggs — who had a role in the Great Train Robbery of 1963 and escaped from a London prison in 1965 — to live here in freedom for decades. As Tom Hanks’s character puts it in  The Money Pit   1986    Don’t they have any laws in Brazil  Don’t they have any police   Then there’s the con artist in  Hot Millions   1968  who enters the country with a bag full of money. When he gets to customs he opens the bag and says exactly what it contains —  money  — to which the officer just answers   Enjoy your stay in Brazil.  According to  The Foreign Eye   a 2006 documentary by Lúcia Murat more than 40 nonBrazilian movies involve outlaws expressing a desire to flee to Brazil. Yet only a few of them succeed. Perhaps the most famous example is Mel Brooks’s  The Producers   1968  in which Max Bialystock and his accountant Leo Bloom plan to take their million dollars and fly to Rio but end up in prison instead. If over the years these characters don’t look to Brazil because of its disreputable loose laws or reputation as a sunny paradise they come searching for adventure in a  primitive  land full of unknown dangers. They might refer to South America as if it were a single country and mix up Brazil and Mexico. In  The Blood of Fu Manchu   1968  the diabolical mastermind Fu Manchu  played by Christopher Lee  ensconced himself in the Brazilian jungle and planned to use an ancient Incan poison in his evil plot to conquer the world.  Never mind that the Inca Empire was located in modernday Peru.  That same year a sophisticated handsome Thomas Crown  Steve McQueen  gave a hint to Vicki Anderson  Faye Dunaway  about his final destination in  The Thomas Crown Affair    Samba Sugarloaf Jungle Piranha.  Little do they know. When it comes to stereotypes Brazil is above all an exotic tropical wilderness full of beautiful women wearing small bikinis. Many outlaws dream about ending their lives on Copacabana Beach drinking piña coladas just like the protagonist of  Max Dugan Returns   1983 . In Brazil’s vast runaway filmography Michael Keaton dances a samba after defrauding the lottery   The Squeeze   1987  Eric Idle and Robbie Coltrane disguise themselves as nuns to retire from their gangster jobs   Nuns on the Run   1990  Val Kilmer and Kim Basinger flee here with  3 million   The Real McCoy   1993  and Kerry Fox buys a oneway ticket to Brazil after leaving her best friends to die   Shallow Grave   1994 . For years these paradise clichés remained remarkably consistent. Less than a decade ago we had Philip Seymour Hoffman robbing from his own parents to fund his escape to Rio with his wife   Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead   2007  while the Hulk hides from the United States military in a Brazilian favela   The Incredible Hulk   2008 . A little later Johnny Depp as John Dillinger planned to grab a plane to Caracas and then to Rio  for some fun in the sun    Public Enemies   2009 . The most recent movie in this lineage is  Fast Five   2011 . It shows Vin Diesel’s character escaping from prison and then going to Rio in order to steal  100 million from a corrupt businessman. But this time the image of Brazil has changed. It is depicted as a land of armed drug traffickers and easy women. Oddly lots of people speak Spanish. One character says that everybody in Rio can be bought another one calls the place a  hellhole.  From heaven to hell in just a few frames.  ,crimes
https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/if-banks-are-outlawed-only-outlaws-will-have-banks/,If Banks Are Outlawed  Only Outlaws Will Have Banks," I know that’s a popular theme among some Austrians. But it’s actually neither a good idea nor even feasible. The crucial thing is to understand what banks do. And it’s not mostly about money creation  Instead what banks are for is helping to improve the tradeoff between returns and liquidity.  Banks can largely resolve this tension by offering deposits that can be withdrawn on demand yet investing most of the funds thus raised in longterm illiquid projects. What makes this possible is the fact that normally
                    only some depositors want to withdraw funds in any given period so it’s normally possible to meet those demands without actually having liquid assets backing every deposit. And this solution makes the economy
                    more productive providing more liquidity even as it allows more productive investment. The problem of course is the vulnerability of such a system to selffulfilling panics  if people believe that a bank will fail everyone will in fact want to withdraw funds at the same time — and because the
                    bank’s assets are illiquid trying to meet those demands through fire sales can in fact cause the bank to fail. This then leads to the need for policy  deposit insurance and or lender of last resort facilities to head off bank runs and bank regulation to reduce the moral hazard from these explicit or implicit guarantees. And
                    by the way the FDICplusregulations system kept us free of banking crises for 50 years after the Great Depression it was only when financial deregulation eroded that system that the bad stuff started happening
                    again. So what would happen if you simply tried to eliminate fractional reserve banking  First of all you would be trying to ban a genuinely productive activity. Dick Fuld banking may have been a bad thing but Jimmy Stewart banking was very much a useful profession. Second you would run smack into the problem of defining what constitutes a bank. One of the great things about DiamondDybvig is that it immediately punctures any superficial notion that a bank can be defined by some traditional appearance — that it basically has to be a marble building with
                    rows of tellers i.e. a depository institution. Any arrangement that borrows short and lends long that offers investors claims that are liquid while using their funds to make illiquid investments is a bank in an
                    economic sense — and is potentially subject to bank runs. Indeed what we had in 2008 was mainly a run on shadow banks on nondepository institutions. So are you going to ban fractional reserve strategies by money market funds  Are you going to ban repo  Auction rate securities  Where does it stop  To be fair it’s difficult even to regulate shadow banking. But if there are benefits to being under the regulatory regime — insurance access to lender of last resort etc. — you have at least
                    a fighting chance of getting most of the dangerous stuff under the umbrella. If you try to ban banks from well banking all the banking is going to take place in the areas not subject to the ban leaving you more
                    vulnerable to crisis than before. Let me add that the fractional reserve thing exhibits a characteristic common to a lot of what I see in the Paulist camp  they have an oddly antiquated notion of what money and finance are about one that misses the
                     virtualness  of the modern world. They still think of money as being pieces of green paper rather than what it mostly is now zeroes and ones in some server somewhere. They still think of banks as
                    being those big marble buildings in a world in which most banking is a lot more abstract than that. This is after all the 21st century. Things have moved on a bit. Paul Krugman is an OpEd columnist for The New York Times. ",crimes

Mr Moehringer a Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist frames his narrative by reimagining a daylong interview and  nickel tour  of New York City that Sutton gave a reporter after being released from prison on Christmas Eve in 1969.  Sadly   Mr Moehringer writes in an author’s note  Sutton and the reporter and the photographer are all gone so what happened among them that Christmas and what happened to Sutton during the preceding sixtyeight years is anyone’s guess.

But it’s also my wish.    The anthology includes essays by architects academics and social critics including Marshall Berman Peter Marcuse and Alexander Cooper and transcribed conversations between Ron Shiffman one of the editors and urban planners. The book’s general premise is unarguable   We need to be vigilant to assure that both the availability of public space and the policies that govern its use in no way impede the right to assemble.  But the editors could have pushed contributors even further toward a square reckoning with the urban planning challenges suggested by the title. In one essay for example Janette SadikKhan New York City’s transportation commissioner praises the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for its introduction of new pedestrian plazas and other innovations. Fair enough but she makes no mention of the Occupy protests.   Mr Lifflander a lawyer and a former Albany operative himself recounts the 1913 case in nothingbutthefacts detail and recalls the powerbrokering by party bosses that led to the only impeachment of a sitting governor in state history.  Where the court of appeals judges disagreed on questions of legal liability   he writes  all of them agreed on moral guilt.  Somehow Sulzer held on to his sense of humor. The following year when the state comptroller billed him for 35 cents worth of biscuits from the Executive Mansion budget for Patsy the governor’s Irish terrier Sulzer replied that Patsy  was a legitimate resident of the mansion and if the state wanted to collect they would have to impeach Patsy   too. Redemption was a long time coming though.

 Dr. Perri Klass on family health.     Headaches are common in children interfering with school with activities with life in general. Many children get migraines even some too young to describe their symptoms  Sometimes they hit themselves in the head
                    in reaction to the pain. Other children get  tensiontype  headaches sometimes related to muscle tightness or to stress. Children’s headaches can be related to ailments from allergies to ear infections to sinus problems and most of the time they don’t indicate a dangerous illness. But for many parents the shadow of a
                    terrible diagnosis lurks in the corner of the darkened room where a headachy child is lying with a cool cloth on her brow.   Children who brought their aching heads into emergency rooms were more likely to get scans than children visiting their regular doctors or neurology clinics.  However even outside the emergency room the use
                    of CT scans was quite high   said Andrea DeVries a director of research at HealthCore a subsidiary of the insurer WellPoint and the lead author of the new study. About twothirds of the children who received
                    CT scans did not visit an emergency room she noted.  Symptoms like these quickly push a headache into the realm of a neurological emergency. Headaches that wake children from sleep or occur on just one side also may be cause for concern.  In serious situations the eye exam may reveal signs of increased pressure in the brain. On a more mundane level an exam may find that a child’s headache is caused by eye strain.  The mother and father might not notice till reading age third grade or fourth grade   Dr. Lee said. Headaches that come on at that age and are made worse by homework or reading can be treated with
                    glasses to correct poor vision and exercises to strengthen the eye movements.   Children can take painkillers  acetaminophen ibuprofen and others children should not take aspirin . Those with migraines may also benefit from preventive medicines. Counseling and biofeedback are important  Headaches
                    can be triggered by stress and living with chronic pain can cause depression. One goal in headache clinics is getting children back to school and helping them navigate regular activities while still avoiding their
                    triggers.  Many many kids will outgrow their bad headaches   said Dr. Daniel Bonthius professor of pediatrics and neurology at the University of Iowa.  Exactly why they got the headaches and exactly why

https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/opinion/california-culprits.html,California Culprits, Federal investigators have now unearthed further evidence that market manipulation by energy companies played an important role in California s power crisis in 2000 and 2001. We have long known that clever trading strategies devised by companies like Enron helped jack up the price of power. Now comes a ruling from an administrative judge at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the El Paso Corporation illegally inflated the price of natural gas. Because natural gas is used to produce much of California s power inflating its price had the effect of driving up the cost of electricity. The company has denied the charges. The ruling must be reviewed by the four members of the regulatory commission and will almost certainly be appealed if the commission upholds the judge. Yet the company s case does not look promising. According to the judge Curtis Wagner Jr. El Paso deliberately reduced the flow of natural gas through the main pipeline into Southern California leaving more than 20 percent of the pipeline s capacity unused from Nov. 1 2000 to March 31 2001. In that same period natural gas prices in Southern California soared to five times the price elsewhere in the country and indeed on the other side of the California border in Mexico. The report represents the first time that any federal regulatory official has found widespread manipulation of energy supplies as distinct from energy prices. The finding represents vindication for California s Gov. Gray Davis and Senator Dianne Feinstein who have long suspected manipulation by gas companies. It also reflects well on the commission chairman Patrick Wood III. A complaint from California about El Paso s behavior had languished in the files for nearly a year until Mr Wood came aboard and cranked up the commission s investigative apparatus. More broadly the ruling demonstrates the folly of rushing to simple answers about something as complicated as the California energy crisis. It will be recalled that Vice President Dick Cheney put most of the blame on a natural gas shortage which he then used as an argument for opening up vast areas of the West  including Alaska  to oil and gas exploration. It s now clear that the shortages were exacerbated by some of Mr Cheney s old friends in the energy business who gamed the system. By the same token however it would also be wrong to blame the whole mess on manipulation. For one thing industry did not build nearly enough new capacity to keep pace with California s booming economy. For another the state s flawed deregulation scheme practically invited unscrupulous behavior. Still it s encouraging that Washington is finally getting the goods on the manipulators. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/30/opinion/multiculturalism-is-not-the-culprit.html,Multiculturalism is not the culprit,    The July bombings in London have prompted a wave of criticism of the supposedly sinister role of multiculturalism in alienating and rendering susceptible to terrorist violence young male members of Britain s Muslim immigrant communities. The outcry is leading some British politicians to call into question a commitment to racial tolerance which with some lamentable exceptions has distinguished Britain for decades from its European partners. Some of the suggestions they have made are sensible like scrutinizing more carefully alleged foreign supporters of terrorism who request to enter. Others however are divisively counterproductive such as a proposal that would allow the deportation for vaguely defined criminal activity of noncitizens to countries where they would be at risk of torture. Now overt racial profiling of Asianlooking men by London s Metropolitan Police has begun to spark opposition among many British Muslims whose support will be important to future counterterrorism efforts. The notion that excessive tolerance toward ethnic minorities and immigrants has sown the seeds of terrorist violence would be laughable were it not so wrong. To be sure a policy of  live and let live  may feed alienation when some communities enjoy markedly inferior opportunities for quality education and employment. Fostering enhanced integration of marginalized groups into British society should be a priority. But ending Britain s historic openness to others would be a grave mistake and would do nothing to address the threat of terrorism. Terrorism is not confined to countries that promote ethnic diversity on the contrary terrorists flourish in societies that suppress legitimate dissent and lack basic institutions of good governance. Iraq Saudi Arabia and Yemen for example have witnessed terrorist violence on their soil in recent years. If the impoverishment and alienation of immigrant youth constitute a security risk  as well as a humanitarian concern  this may reflect not too much multiculturalism but rather not enough antidiscrimination measures. Multicultural policies involve a laissezfaire tolerance of ethnic minorities and their cultural practices. By contrast antidiscrimination policies require more affirmative state engagement to combat acts of violence and exclusion that invidiously target minorities. For more than three decades Britain has led Europe in the adoption of antidiscrimination legislation and to good effect. Persons of color have gained significant status representation and recognition in journalism business and the halls of government. But the persistent ghettoization of minority communities is evidence that more concerted efforts are required to combat prejudice improve crosscultural education provide skillsbased employment training and foster genuine economic promise. Loyalty to an adopted nation is instilled more effectively by equal opportunity than by citizenship oaths. But racial tolerance is not a policy preference exclusive to Britain. A European Union directive mandates that all EU members prohibit and effectively redress discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin. And since 2000 the European Commission the EU s executive arm has been vigorously overseeing the transposition into national law of this equal treatment principle in all areas of economic and social life. The lesson is clear  Don t use the very real threat of terrorism to justify shelving more than a quarter century of British achievement in the field of race relations. Combatting terrorism is primarily a task for law enforcement and intelligence. To the extent that the roots of terrorism may be found in the disaffection of Muslim or other youth what is needed is more state action in fostering equal opportunity not less. Britain s generally levelheaded reason on questions of race make its current shift of course all the more troubling. Throughout much of the world the British model of enlightened democratic government and liberal thought backed by an independent judiciary committed to the rule of law is rightly admired. It would be a shame for Britain and others were this longstanding tradition to become yet another casualty of the misguided  war on terror.   ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/16/health/lyme-disease-cause-bacteria-borrelia-mayonii.html,A New Culprit in Lyme Disease,    Six patients with the infection were identified by the researchers. The patients had symptoms similar to but not precisely the same as those caused by Borrelia burgdorferi until now the only species known to cause Lyme disease in North America.   Because the symptoms vary slightly from those normally seen in B. burgdorferi infection doctors may not even think to test for Lyme disease she said. Only one of the six patients had the bull’seye rash that is Lyme’s signature present in 70 percent to 80 percent of reported cases. Three patients had a rash that was more spread out Dr. Pritt said. The new strain apparently adds nausea and vomiting to the list of typical Lyme symptoms which include fever headache and neck pain. B. mayonii patients also had a higherthanexpected concentration of bacteria in their blood. Fortunately the antibiotic treatment normally used to treat Lyme disease appears to be effective against B. mayonii Dr. Pritt said. In the summer of 2013 a technician in Dr. Pritt’s lab noticed some unusual results from a genetic screen of a patient’s bacterial infection. The test suggested Lyme disease but a closer analysis found a new species of bacteria causing the condition. It is not yet clear where B. mayonii came from Dr. Pritt said though it does not seem to have recently diverged from B. burgdorferi. It may be that the species has always been present but was picked up only with better detection tools or that the new bacteria are increasing for some reason.  We hope to be able to answer that with more studies   Dr. Pritt said. In Europe Lyme disease is caused by multiple pathogenic species of Borrelia said PerEric Lindgren a professor of medical microbiology at Linkoping University in Sweden.  Although the six patients at the Mayo Clinic received the diagnoses with typical tests he said  normally you’re only able to detect what you are looking for.  Other cases are probably being missed Dr. Lindgren added   It’s very likely you could make the diagnostic tools better.    This is just another great reason to protect yourself against ticks   he said. To protect against tickborne illnesses people should wear repellents and check their skin for black specks after spending time outdoors particularly in wooded areas and during the late spring and early summer months when nymphs are present. The nymphs are smaller than the adults and easier to miss on the skin Mr Neitzel said. If a tick is removed within the first 24 to 48 hours it is unlikely to cause disease.  The sooner you get that tick off of your body the better   he said.  You don’t have to get too many ticks on you before you find one that’s infected with something.  Dr. Pritt said she was now far more cautious outdoors.  If you’ve ever looked at an idyllic picture of a beautiful meadow with flowers — I look at it and think about all the ticks in there   she said. ,crimes

https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/08/nyregion/08nyc.html,Helping Girls as Victims  Not Culprits, NYC  Miranda’s story is typical and yet not. It’s typical of many girls who run away from home only to land in the arms of older men whom they mistake for protectors. Most adults would recognize these men for what they are. They’re pimps. She was all of 14 when she fled her mother’s house in Brooklyn and found herself  in the life   the world of the street hustler.  I didn’t really know what I was getting into   said Miranda who for reasons that should be obvious avoided giving a last name or even a true first name. Before long she was arrested for prostitution. It would not be her last runin with the law. At least this pimp did not beat her. Her second pimp did knocking out a few teeth and sending her to the hospital. Miranda was 16 then. She had tried going back home but her mother lost patience with her and kicked her out.  I thought for a while that I was crazy and I was the child from hell   she said. As we said her story fits a familiar pattern with girls and sexual predators. Not necessarily typical is the way she reversed direction with help from Girls Educational and Mentoring Services or Gems a Harlembased organization that each year offers counseling and other assistance to more than 200 of the city’s Mirandas. At 18 Miranda has just graduated from high school and is looking at possible colleges. That she is firmly on an educational track at a normal age is no small accomplishment given her rough past.  I feel like a lotus   she said.  A lotus starts in muddy water but grows into something beautiful.  Also not typical are her journeys to Albany to urge that lawmakers rethink how the state deals with children  girls in the main  who become sexual prey. Her efforts and those of others paid off a couple of weeks ago when the Legislature by unanimous votes in both houses passed the Safe Harbor for Sexually Exploited Children Act. Instead of being treated as criminals as they are now girls age 15 and under would be viewed as victims the first time they are arrested for prostitution. They would be classified as  persons in need of supervision   or PINS and offered social services and protection from their pimps in a dormitorystyle shelter. Essentially the Safe Harbor bill brings state law in line with federal statutes governing foreigners who make it to the United States in the clutches of sex traffickers. Those nonAmericans are dealt with as victims not criminals.  Now people born in Brooklyn will get the same treatment as someone born in Ukraine or Thailand or wherever   said Mishi Faruqee director of the youth justice program of the Children’s Defense Fund in New York. It is not clear however if Gov. David A. Paterson will sign the bill. A spokeswoman said only that the governor would look at it once it is formally sent to him. Were Mr Paterson still in the State Senate  this would have been an issue he would have been all over   said Robert Gangi executive director of the Correctional Association of New York a nonprofit group that focuses on prison policy. But groups like his worry that the governor might be leaning toward a veto in part to avoid a new multimilliondollar expense in tough times. And despite those unanimous legislative votes an override of a veto cannot be assumed said Assemblyman William Scarborough a Democrat of Queens. He is a chief sponsor of the measure with State Senator Dale M. Volker a Republican of western New York. A prominent opponent of the bill is the Bloomberg administration although it has stopped short of urging a veto publicly anyway. City Hall agrees that the girls are victims said John Feinblatt the mayor’s criminal justice coordinator. But  the PINS process has no teeth   he said and so keeping these children firmly in the court system is preferable.  Our thought was that the best way to reach them was not through decriminalization but rather using the leverage of courtordered services   Mr Feinblatt said in an interview. His assessment of the legislation was a lot harsher in an article that he wrote for The New York Post in June under the headline  NY’s ProPimp Bill.  If it became law he wrote girls would find it relatively easy to run right back to their exploiters. He’s wrong says Rachel Lloyd who founded Gems a decade ago and is its executive director. Born in England Ms. Lloyd was  in the life  herself as a teenager. In part the problem is one of perception she said.  These are not kids with cancer  they’re not the kids people feel the most empathy for.  Can’t these girls be quite a handful though  Ms. Lloyd is not convinced that they are all as tough as many might think.  Whatever your stereotype is   she said  when you sit down and talk to them you see that a kid is a kid.  ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/business/25oil.html,Congress Looks for a Culprit for Rising Oil Prices,  With Americans growing angrier by the day about high gasoline prices nobody can accuse Congress of turning a deaf ear. On Wednesday lawmakers will hold their 40th hearing so far this year on the cause of high oil prices. Filing bills on Capitol Hill to combat the problem is becoming a cottage industry with clever names like the Prevent Unfair Manipulation of Prices Act or PUMP Act and the No Excuses Energy Act. Until recently lawmakers had focused on the traditional suspects  oil companies and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. But increasingly they are casting a suspicious eye on the role of investors including speculators in driving up prices. As the ninth hearing of the month gets under way on Wednesday one of the nation’s bestknown energy experts Daniel Yergin is expected to tell Congress that the focus on speculation is largely misguided. Mr Yergin will join numerous other energy experts who have declared that the rise in oil prices can be explained by basic economic factors such as the limited growth in supplies in recent years a weakening dollar a global surge in energy demand and a string of production disruptions in countries like Nigeria.  When an issue is this hot it would be so much easier if there was a single reason to blame   Mr Yergin said in an interview on Tuesday previewing his testimony before Congress.  The oil shock is real and is about the hottest political issue right now   he said.  So Congress feels the pressure to do something but there is not much it can do to promote peace in Nigeria or to get the value of the dollar to go up.  Mr Yergin is the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates a consulting firm and the Pulitzer Prizewinning author of  The Prize   an authoritative history of the oil business. He will speak on Wednesday before the Joint Economic Committee headed by Senator Charles E. Schumer Democrat of New York. Mr Yergin said the market is relentlessly bidding up oil prices in response to deepseated fears that the growth in demand will keep outpacing the growth in oil supplies in coming years.  There is a shortage psychology in the financial markets and that is reflected in the price of oil   Mr Yergin said in the interview.  You are seeing a lot of people who have never invested in commodities who are now piling into the market. But calling it speculation is way too simplistic.  What role financial institutions  pension funds mutual funds and hedge funds among others  are playing in driving up the price of oil to nearly  140 a barrel remains a key question. Regulators in Washington have acknowledged that they do not have enough information on speculative trading in commodity markets. Even though the evidence is incomplete speculators have nonetheless become prime targets for legislative action. Gasoline prices now average  4.07 a gallon up more than  1 a gallon in the past year according to AAA the automobile group. The price of oil  the main reason behind the runup in gasoline prices  has doubled in the past year settling Tuesday at  137 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange up 26 cents. There is little doubt that investments in commodity markets have grown in recent years as investors sought assets offering better returns than stocks bonds or currencies. Investors faced with a weakening dollar a slowing economy and rising inflation found a hedge in crude oil. Some analysts who testified before a House panel on Monday estimated that oil prices could fall to around  60 a barrel if speculators were driven out of the commodity market. But others warned that assessing how much if at all investors have pushed up prices is an impossible task. Relatively little is known about oil investments in some lightly regulated markets like the IntercontinentalExchange an electronic exchange based in Atlanta that has gained prominence as an energy marketplace. Facing mounting pressure to step up its oversight the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington said that it had recognized the need for better information. Its acting chairman Walter L. Lukken said his agency was seeking more trading data from exchanges in both the United States and abroad. Senator Schumer’s committee provided an advance copy of Mr Yergin’s prepared testimony. In it Mr Yergin did not discount the rising role of investors in energy markets. But he said their presence was more a consequence than a cause of the tight markets.  Financial markets are today playing an increasingly important role in price formation  responding to accentuating and exaggerating supply and demand geopolitics and other trends   Mr Yergin says in the prepared remarks. But he pointed to a variety of other factors that have made the runup possible. Nigeria for example is producing one million barrels a day less than its production capacity because of disruptions caused by attacks in the oilrich Niger Delta. Production has stagnated in countries like Russia and Venezuela and is even plunging in places like Mexico. All these factors have left the global oil industry with little capacity to boost supplies. There is now less than two million barrels a day of unused capacity a safety cushion that has declined from about five million barrels a day in 2002.  In a tight market prices go up   Mr Yergin said.  And a tight market is also a market that is more crisisprone more vulnerable to the impact of disruptions.  Senator Schumer in an interview said he could see no easy answers to high oil prices.  Everyone would like to believe that there is a silver bullet  like a bubble or speculation  that can solve our oil problem   he said. Instead he said it would be better for the nation to focus on conserving energy and reducing its oil consumption. ,crimes

OpEd Contributor  HONG KONG — Asian reactions to the socalled US debt crisis amount to a mixture of bafflement and hypocrisy. Fear of the knockon effect on regional economies sits sidebyside with assumptions by Asians that they had no part in creating today’s problems. The Chinese have been howling particularly loudly. Chinese media have been castigating the US government for reliance on debt finance while the state rating agency Dagong not only took the lead in downgrading US debt but has said that Washington has already defaulted. Yet just as Western countries or at least their banks played a crucial role in turning the 1997 Asian crisis of liquidity into a crisis of solvency Asia is now ignoring the fact that the US problem is less one of government debt than of sustained international trade imbalances which have transformed America into a debtor nation. And the policies of Asian nations have contributed to this problem. By the standards of many countries — including China if one adds statebank and localgovernment debt to the debt of the central government — the US government’s debt is not exceptional. Japan’s is far greater yet the yen has become one of the safe havens for those fleeing the dollar. The US debt  crisis  was in fact largely a creation of the antics of US Congressmen. The underlying problem in the United States is not so much the level of government debt but the persistence of the overall trade deficit which has meant that Washington unlike Tokyo has had to rely heavily on foreigners to buy its debt. The ability of United States — because of the US dollar’s position as the main reserve currency — to borrow so easily is only half an explanation. No one forced China Korea and other Asian countries to buy so much US debt. And other countries were not forced to peg their currencies to the dollar. No one forced them to try to gain trade advantages while depriving their own people of purchasing power by manipulating their currencies. No one forced them to endure inflation rather than raise interest rates and allow their currencies to appreciate significantly. The dollar needs to decline further vis à vis some Asian currencies. That way the United States will return to trade equilibrium while surplus countries will be forced to substitute domestic demand for external demand if they want to grow and ultimately to protect the longterm value both of the dollar and of their huge holdings of Treasury bonds. The  threat  not to buy more US bonds if Washington does not mend its ways is no threat at all. The dollar will decline but the Fed will buy the bonds and China and others will have to find other assets to buy — like their neighbors’ bonds if they are allowed. In short the current socalled crisis is causing yet again some bizarre panicdriven decision making. The Korean government has chosen this moment to buy gold at a price six times that of August 2001 and within sight in inflationadjusted terms of its shortlived 1980 peak. Asian investors are continuing to believe that countries like Australia and New Zealand are safe havens even though their foreign debts relative to their economies are several times those of the United States. New Zealand has net foreign debt of 130 percent of G.D.P. and Australia 60 percent yet they still get a top rating from the credit rating agencies and their currencies have been very strong despite experiencing external deficits during a boom in their commodity export prices. Meanwhile the currencies that should be much stronger — like South Korean won Taiwan and Hong Kong dollars and Chinese renminbi — are forcibly held back. It is all very well for China to bemoan the decline in the credit worthiness of the United States but its own credibility can only be tested by exposure to the market. Asian national currencies can only play the larger global role they say they want if they are more freely traded — particularly by their own citizens. In sum it appears that the 200809 recession was too short for the United States and Asian countries to have learned the necessary lessons  The root of global instability still lies in trade imbalances and currency values and the need for adjustments in both Asia and the United States. ,crimes

And for those not inclined to rely on a picture there was the added clue of the book s subtitle   Alan Greenspan and the Missing 7 Trillion Dollars.  The  7 trillion refers to the recent hole in America s equity portfolio and we are to infer that Mr Greenspan the retired Federal Reserve chairman is the fellow who caused all that swag to go  missing.  And there he is on Page 5 warning that America s exuberance for stocks is tending toward the irrational. We have another Greenspan sighting on Page 19 he pops up again on Page 24. Then poof  he is gone like a marquee actor patiently awaiting his scene. Mr Hartcher meanwhile indulges in a retelling of the stock bubble which he terms  the biggest speculative mania the world has seen.  He also thinks that it was an  aberration without precedent   which it was not  and  the most costly event in the history of the US  a claim that would be hard to define yet alone verify. So back we are in the giddy years of hot stock offerings and piggish chief executives but where did Alan go  Mr Hartcher cites a familiar list of culprits like the media and Wall Street.  He lets investors themselves off the hook.  On Page 74 his narrative finally chances upon the Federal Reserve. So this is when we get to Mr Greenspan. But no. First  improbably    A word on Al Qaeda.  When finally the author encounters his subject he has an interesting and novel thesis. His material is not for the most part original he generously quotes from virtually everyone else  including me  who has written on the subject. But where he goes with it is his own. For Mr Hartcher the moment of truth came in December 1996 in a famous speech in which the Fed chief rhetorically asked whether stock prices were becoming  irrational.  His audience some 1 300 dinner guests of a Washington think tank missed his meaning and regarded the speech as a snoozer. But Wall Street got it the market tanked the very next day. Mr Hartcher demonstrates that this was no accident Mr Greenspan had purposefully inserted the phrase in the hope of cooling off a market that he regarded already as worrisomely bubbly. Alas after that brief flirtation with caution the bull market resumed. Mr Hartcher s central question is why Mr Greenspan did nothing more to stop it. He quotes Joseph E. Stiglitz the Nobel economist and author  If Mr Greenspan  thought share prices were heading out of control if he feared the wider effects of a bubble why didn t he go ahead and act   Arguably to preempt then would have been premature. The Dow Jones industrial average was at only 6 400 the Nasdaq at a mere 1 300. The bubble to which Mr Hartcher s title refers and which ultimately elevated the Dow to 11 700 had in hindsight barely begun. But this is a quibble. Admittedly Mr Greenspan should have put the brakes on at some point probably late in 1998 when new technology issues led by eBay began to double in a day. This was when the new economy became crazy. Mr Hartcher says Mr Greenspan master politician and media manipulator that he conjures him to be compromised his beliefs out of a politically expedient desire to retain the support of variously President Bill Clinton Senator Trent Lott the rest of Congress and the sharecrazed public. Even in that 1996 address Mr Greenspan observed that monetary policy independence  is conditional on pursuing policies that are broadly acceptable to the American people.  Thus Mr Hartcher argues Mr Greenspan suppressed his own deep misgivings about the bubble out of  Machiavellian  cunning. The author quotes a former Fed deputy Alice M. Rivlin as saying that  Greenspan doesn t like to lose and if he thinks he ll lose he switches sides.  He was in short a coward. But this seems unlikely. The onetime dance band clarinetist was no shrinking violet and as Fed chief he bucked convention more than most. Nor did his faith in markets develop overnight. A youthful disciple of Ayn Rand and a freemarket purist Mr Greenspan was ever skeptical of regulation and this other ideological Alan never disappeared from view. While the prudent Alan was issuing a warning to traders the exuberant Alan was already smitten with the conceits of the new economy. As early as his famous speech the Fed chief was wondering thoughtfully and at times brilliantly how the 90 s economy was able to grow at such an auspicious pace without stoking inflation. And because inflation not stock prices was his primary responsibility he was hesitant to intervene. The author rightly faults Mr Greenspan for reassuring the public as the market climbed to the stratosphere implicitly offering investors the false comfort that he could protect them from loss. In a speech on March 6 2000 four days from the peak Mr Greenspan celebrated both the technological and financial miracles writ in Silicon Valley and offered this clinker   I see nothing to suggest that these opportunities will peter out any time soon.  Yet far from proving that Mr Greenspan had all the answers and cynically disregarded them as Mr Hartcher maintains such embarrassing quotations merely suggest that the Fed chairman was as wrong as everyone else. Mr Hartcher labors hard to show that Mr Greenspan s mistakes caused enduring damage. The problem of course is that most of the  7 trillion is no longer missing and that the economy too has recovered. Perhaps this explains Mr Hartcher s long and curious preamble  first remind us how bad the bubble was then indict Mr Greenspan as its author. But it is one thing to  cause  a bubble yet another to fail to prevent it while also presiding over 18plus mostly prosperous years. Mr Hartcher suggests that the recovery is itself illusory purchased with foreign credit and stimulated by a new bubble in housing. And who can prove that a new crash isn t around the corner  I am in a real sweat over it myself. But in the meantime this overwrought smear does not quite have the goods. ,crimes

The FBI is investigating a confrontation between a Black man and a group of white men who pinned him against a tree at an Indiana lake over the Fourth of July weekend after video of the episode drew broad condemnation. Lauren Hagee Glintz a spokeswoman for the FBI confirmed the investigation on Wednesday morning but declined to provide any further comment.   The incident near Lake Monroe began when a group of white men told Mr Booker and his friends that they were on private property he said on Facebook. Part of the confrontation was captured on a cellphone video that Mr Booker posted online. The video showed Mr Booker being held against a tree by one man and surrounded closely by several others. Bystanders can be heard calling for them to let him go.  I was attacked by five white men   Mr Booker said in the post  who literally threatened to lynch me in front of numerous witnesses.  He said he had heard the men say  get a noose  and use racial slurs. Mr Booker said that bystanders eventually got the men to stop and that he and his friends left the area and called the authorities. In another video the men can be seen following Mr Booker and his friends accusing them of trespassing and berating them with profanity. In his Facebook post Mr Booker said he had a minor concussion some abrasions bruising and loss of hair from being pulled. Katharine Liell Mr Booker’s lawyer said at a news conference this week that the FBI was investigating the case as a possible hate crime.  Mr Booker and his lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources which manages Lake Monroe is also investigating the incident James Brindle a spokesman for the department said on Wednesday. No arrests have been made and an incident report was not immediately available.  Our conservation officers are working with the Monroe County prosecutor’s office   Mr Brindle said. Lake Monroe sits on land owned by the Army Corps of Engineers private owners and the Hoosier National Forest he said adding that the state leases land from the corps for recreational purposes. Mr Booker spoke at the news conference addressing a crowd of supporters with signs that read  Black Lives Matter.   We’re not a community where you can lynch someone in the street   he said.  We are a community that is welcoming or inclusive and we are going to make sure that justice is served.   They also condemned another incident in which a sheriff’s deputy of a neighboring county questioned and detained a Black resident who was walking down the street  in an apparent example of racial profiling.   We would like to express outrage and grief relating to two apparent racially motivated incidents reported in our community ’’ the statement said.  These separate incidents exemplify the persistence of racism and bias in our country and our own community. They deserve nothing less than our collective condemnation.  State Senator Mark Stoops whose district includes most of Monroe County also said he was  horrified to hear about this racist attack  at the lake.  He called for Gov. Eric Holcomb to immediately suspend the Department of Natural Resources officers involved. ,crimes

It failed also because Lador did not understand that his appetite for prosecuting Olmert ran against the broader interest
                    of the Israeli public.   In other words the Olmert prosecution was an instance of anticorruption sentiment run amok. A prime minister duly elected by the people was forced out of power by charges that a court has now rejected. And the consequences
                    have been significant. Because of these charges Tzipi Livni became leader of the centerleft. Because of these charges an early election was held. Because of these charges Benjamin Netanyahu became prime minister.     That Olmert lost an important position because of the trial is hardly the point. That he might not have deserved to come into Lador’s viewfinder is also only marginally important  unlike lesser defendants Olmert

                    as guilty of corruption until proved innocent. It should be especially careful with indictments against the prime minister. Yes I’m saying that the prime minister deserves special treatment. That all Israelis stand equal before the law doesn’t just mean that the head of the government can be accused as readily as every citizen. It also means that we as citizens have the right to be governed by the

World War II in the Pacific was a war of atrocity. For the Allies. the conflict was defined by Imperial Japan’s ravaging of Nanjing. the aerial bombardment of Chongqing. the Bataan death march of helpless American and Filipino prisoners of war and the sack of Manila. The Japanese were shocked and traumatized by the devastating American firebombing of more than 60 of their cities. including the incineration of Tokyo in March 1945. Not long afterward. Henry Stimson. the American war secretary. privately warned Harry Truman that the Air Force  might have Japan so thoroughly bombed out that the new weapon   the atomic bombs that would soon annihilate Hiroshima and Nagasaki   would not have a fair background to show its strength.    When the Japanese Empire surrendered in August 1945. it accepted the Allied demand that  stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals. including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners.  The top Japanese leadership  including the militaristic Tojo. who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor  faced an international Allied war crimes tribunal in Tokyo. while lower ranking suspects accused of conventional war crimes or crimes against humanity were hauled in front of numerous special courts set up by various Allied countries. Paradis’s book tells how four Japanese officers held responsible for the killing of the Doolittle airmen were tried as suspected war criminals by a United States military commission in postwar Shanghai.  Paradis’s account points blame less at the four Japanese defendants facing the military commission than at the senior Japanese leaders who launched the war. including Tojo and other powerful militarists. An idealistic young Japanese defense lawyer believed that the Japanese defendants. like the Doolittle airmen and  the rest of Japan. were victims of the militarists. who had left millions dead for nothing.  As for Emperor Hirohito. by pardoning five of the American prisoners. he had demonstrated his formal authority and thus implicated himself in the executions of the other three. Yet while Tojo was convicted and hanged as a Class A war criminal by the Allied tribunal at Tokyo. the emperor was never prosecuted. his authority seen by the Truman administration as crucial for ending the war and then for legitimating the postwar American occupation of Japan. In March and April 1946. shortly before the American military commission rendered its verdict in the Doolittle case. Hirohito  facing public calls for his abdication or trial  gave a series of self exonerating monologues to his aides behind closed doors at the Imperial Palace.  In a richly researched book. this is a rare piece of evidence that Paradis overlooked. although it only enriches his story.  The emperor himself. who feared the militarists and almost never defied them. judged the three executed Americans as innocent   In fact there seem to have been antiaircraft guns and antiaircraft machine guns at the place attacked by the aircraft. so I think the three men also were not responsible.   Paradis. who writes with warm affection for the Doolittle flyboys and celebrates their mission. notes that Doolittle instructed his airmen to avoid nonmilitary targets. Yet his book makes it uncomfortably clear that they may well have killed Japanese civilians. To this day. Japanese commemorate the strafing of an elementary school in eastern Tokyo during the Doolittle raid. where a 13 year old boy was killed. Paradis cites a 2003 study by researchers affiliated with Japan’s Self Defense Forces that concluded the school was not hit by the bomber carrying the three executed Americans. but that their plane had bombed three homes in Yokohama and strafed another home. killing an infant. Throughout the book. Paradis rightly condemns wartime Japan for its widespread use of torture. In particular. he notes that the American press ran sensational stories about Imperial Japan’s use of waterboarding. seen as a despicable practice of an outlaw nation. Today. with a president of the United States who has recommended that  we should go much stronger than waterboarding.  it is important to remember that at least three of the captured American airmen from the Doolittle raid were waterboarded by the Kempeitai. a torture then notorious as the  water cure.  among other forms of abuse. Paradis recounts the torture of a Brooklyn born navigator   The water had slithered to the back of his throat and then into his lungs. where it had put the panic of death into him.  The State Department protested Japan’s  brutal and bestial methods  and the American public was outraged. That was then. ,crimes

But then the president began talking about crime in Chicago. and naming cities where protests this summer haven’t turned violent.  This is what is alarming about where we are now.  she said.  There is a way in which he is taking this to the next level.   With these forces  which have an intricate web of legal authorities to protect federal property. to operate far from the border. to interchange their roles  legal scholars across the political spectrum fear the president is trying to take on a job that the Constitution did not give to the federal government.  That is the use of federal officers as a just run of the mill domestic policing force.  said Clark Neily. the vice president for criminal justice at the libertarian leaning Cato Institute.  I understand we’re supposed to believe this is an extraordinary circumstance. But it is still fundamentally a local law enforcement responsibility to maintain order and protect lives and property.  The mere fact that cities aren’t doing that job to the president’s satisfaction hasn’t historically been justification for sending in federal forces. Mr Neily said. And there is broad dispute today over whether we are. indeed. in extraordinary circumstances.  This moment is notably different from 1968. when local officials requested federal troops to restore order in Washington. Chicago and Baltimore because they believed they could not do it themselves. It’s different from Oxford. Miss.. in 1962. or Little Rock in 1957. when local officials were openly defying federal court orders to desegregate.  I don’t think there’s anywhere near the same kind of consensus at the federal level that federal authority is actually being subverted  today. said Stephen Vladeck. a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin.  What’s new and troubling here is we have a very. very contested factual predicate. And it’s not remotely clear to me what federal laws are going unenforced.    This is the very thing that scared the heck out of the framers of the Constitution.  said Barry Friedman. a law professor at New York University.  There’s been an over tendency to cry wolf.  he said of the president’s critics over the past four years.  Well. this is wolf. This is it.    He made a point of distinguishing the plans announced Wednesday from the administration’s campaign to counter  riots and mob violence  in places like Portland.  The operations we’re discussing today are very different  they’re classic crime fighting.  Mr Barr said. But that is precisely the problem. say critics like Mr Vladeck and Mr Neily  The federal government isn’t responsible for classic crime fighting in local communities. Yet throughout their comments at the White House on Wednesday. President Trump. Mr Barr and Chad Wolf. the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security. suggested that they believed restoring law and order in local communities was vital to the mission of the federal government.    The through line here is not the protection of federal property.  said Kelly Lytle Hernandez. a historian at U.C.L.A.  It’s the effort to suppress the uprising for Black life. That sounds pretty familiar. That sounds pretty late 19th century.  ,crimes

BERLIN  A German court convicted a 93 year old man on Thursday for helping the Nazis murder thousands of people while he served as a concentration camp guard more than 75 years ago. in what might be one of the last verdicts to be handed down to a living participant in the Holocaust. The Hamburg state court found Bruno Dey guilty of 5.230 counts of accessory to murder  one for each person believed to have been killed in the Stutthof concentration camp. east of Gdansk in Poland. during the time he served as a guard there. from August 1944 to April 1945. Mr Dey. who was tried in juvenile court because he was only 17 years old at the time. was given a two year suspended sentence. reflecting the prosecutors’ acknowledgment of his contrition and willingness to cooperate with authorities. But survivors and those representing them criticized the sentence as too lenient.  It is unsatisfactory and much too late.  said Christoph Heubner of the International Auschwitz Committee. who followed the trial.  What is so upsetting for survivors is that this defendant failed to use the many postwar years of his life to reflect on what he saw and heard.  The trial against Mr Dey was the latest in a push by prosecutors in the special office for handling Nazi era crimes to bring aging suspects to justice before it is too late. And it came at a moment when the country is struggling to deal with a resurgence in right wing extremism. Mr Dey appeared at the Hamburg state court. seated in a wheelchair and wearing a blue surgical mask because of the coronavirus outbreak. He cast his eyes downward as the judge read his sentence. according to German public media.  You still see yourself as a mere observer. when in fact you were an accomplice to this man made hell.  presiding judge Anne Meier Goering told the defendant while reading the verdict.  You did not follow an order to carry out a crime and should not have inferred this.  In a closing statement. Mr Dey said he felt it was important to express his thoughts and feelings about what he had learned during the trial. but also argued that he had been forced to serve as a concentration camp SS guard and was ordered into the position.  The witness testimony and the expert assessments made me realize the full scope of the horrors and suffering.  he told the court.  Today I would like to apologize for those who went through the hell of this insanity. Something like this must never happen again.  The German authorities have intensified their efforts in recent years to hold to account men and women. most of them now over 90. who played smaller roles in helping the Nazis round up and murder Europe’s Jews in their network of concentration and death camps. Throughout the Cold War. these people were overlooked by a justice system that demanded evidence of direct involvement of a Nazi era crime in order to bring charges against a perpetrator.   Last week. another former guard from Stutthof. age 95. was charged with similar crimes. Because Mr Dey was only 17 when he began his guard duties. he was tried as a juvenile. Prosecutors had sought a three year prison sentence for his role at the camp. where he was tasked with making sure that none of the inmates. mostly Polish Jews and political prisoners. escaped. More than 60.000 people  roughly half of whom were Jews  are believed to have died or been killed at the camp. which was the first to be established by the Nazi regime outside of Germany’s borders. Located in the small Polish town of Sztutowo. it served as a prison camp after the invasion of Poland in 1939. Gas chambers were put into use in 1944. and the camp was one of the last to be liberated. More than three dozen survivors testified in the trial. which began in October. They told the court of seeing relatives die in the electric fences that surrounded the Stutthof camp. collecting the bones of other victims and being chased from their barracks. naked in subzero temperatures. Mr Dey acknowledged hearing screams from the camp’s gas chambers and watching as corpses were taken to be burned. But he said he never fired his weapon and that the  images of misery and horror have haunted me my entire life.  For Mr Heubner. of the International Auschwitz Committee. who volunteered at Stutthof during the 1970s and attended several sessions of Mr Dey’s trial as an observer. the statement rang hollow.  The image of him sitting above the camp in his tower is reflective of the view he had of himself as above those who were suffering.  he said.  And although he had decades to confront the horrors of what he witnessed. he remained silent.  Stefan Waterkamp. Mr Dey’s attorney. argued for his client to be acquitted. He said Mr Dey did not become a guard by choice and that trying to flee or resist duty would have put him in danger.  How could an 18 year old step out of line in a situation like this   Mr Waterkamp said as part of his closing argument. Judge Meier Goering said the lesson of the trial must be to  honor human dignity at all costs  even when the price is your own safety.   The attack was the most severe of thousands of crimes committed against Jews in Germany in 2019  the worst year since the country started tracking them in 2001. Prosecutors said the defendant in that trial. Stephan Balliet. had been motivated by a belief that  the root of all these problems is the Jew.  ,crimes

Accused of censorship. now the Army says it will pause streaming.   Not everyone is looking to sign up.  what’s your favorite u.s. w4r cr1me   Jordan Uhl asked in a chat on the Army Twitch channel on July 8. substituting numbers for letters to get around the channel’s moderation settings.  Now. facing criticism from First Amendment advocacy groups who say the ban is unconstitutional. the Army said Wednesday it would pause streaming on Twitch to  review internal policies and procedures. as well as all platform specific policies.  In a letter sent to Army and Navy recruiting officers Wednesday. the Knight First Amendment Institute demanded that the military branches’ channels change their moderation policies and restore access for Mr Uhl and 300 others who have made similar comments in the past few weeks.  An Army spokeswoman. Kelli Bland. said users were banned because their comments constituted harassment. which would violate the terms of service of Twitch. which is owned by Amazon.  The eSports Team blocked the term ‘war crimes’ in its Twitch channel after discovering the trend was meant to troll and harass the team.  Ms. Bland told The New York Times.  Twitch members used creative spelling to continue related posts. Following the guidelines and policies set by Twitch. the US Army eSports Team banned a user from its account due to concern over posted content and website links that were considered harassing and degrading in nature.  A spokeswoman for the Navy said that they planned to continue streaming. They also described Mr Uhl’s behavior as harassment. The First Amendment Institute disputed that Mr Uhl and other users’ remarks were harassment. which Twitch. defines as content  that attempts to intimidate. degrade. abuse. or bully others. or creates a hostile environment for others.  Jameel Jaffer. the executive director of the First Amendment Institute. said he had not yet received a reply from the Army or Navy. and he was prepared to sue them if they did not change their policies. A Twitch spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the conflict. but pointed out that Twitch’s policy states that  channel owners and moderators are free to ban anyone from their channel. regardless of the reason.    The government’s actions here are plainly unconstitutional.  said Naomi Gilens. a legal fellow at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  When a government official or agency creates a forum for speech online and invites the public to participate. it can’t censor speech just because it doesn’t like the message or viewpoints being expressed.   Because the Army and Navy are using these Twitch channels to recruit young people. this issue is about much more than just esports.  Meenakshi Krishnan. a legal fellow at the First Amendment Institute. said in a statement.  Participants in these forums have a constitutional right to engage in speech critical of the military. The Army and Navy certainly have no legitimate interest in suppressing speech relating to war crimes.    Mr Uhl said that the issue was not simply about him as an individual getting banned.  Everyone should be able to criticize the military on their social media channels.  he said.  It’s at the core of free speech protection.    I hope this helps people understand that you’re allowed to criticize the government online.  Mr Uhl said.  As we become an increasingly digital society. the laws need updating and we need protections for political speech online. We can’t have a system where the government can delete or ban negative comments on a social platform.  On Wednesday afternoon. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. a New York Democrat. announced plans to file a measure to block the military from using video games and esports as recruitment methods.     ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/business/media/judd-weinstein-lawsuit-appeal.html,Ashley Judd Can Sue Harvey Weinstein for Sexual Harassment  Court Rules, The ruling reversed a lower court’s dismissal of one of the claims brought by the actress against the now imprisoned movie mogul.  The actress Ashley Judd can proceed with a sexual harassment claim as part of a lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein. the movie mogul imprisoned for sex crimes and a focus of the  MeToo movement. an appeals court ruled on Wednesday.  Ms. Judd. who is known for her roles in  Double Jeopardy.   Kiss the Girls  and  A Time to Kill.  accused Mr Weinstein of undermining her movie career after she rejected his sexual advances in the late 1990s. She also sued Mr Weinstein on claims of defamation and unfair business practices.  The judge’s interpretation of the state’s sexual harassment statute was rejected on Wednesday by the appeals court.  By virtue of his professional position and influence as a top producer in Hollywood. Weinstein was uniquely situated to exercise coercive power or leverage over Judd. who was a young actor at the beginning of her career at the time of the alleged harassment.  the judges wrote in the ruling.  Moreover. given Weinstein’s highly influential and ‘unavoidable’ presence in the film industry. the relationship was one that would have been difficult to terminate ‘without tangible hardship’ to Judd. whose livelihood as an actor depended on being cast for roles.  Ms. Judd has declined to join a class action lawsuit that was brought against Mr Weinstein by dozens of women who accused him of sexual misconduct. She has long sought to have her day in court.  This is an important victory not only for Ms. Judd but for all victims of sexual harassment in professional relationships.  Theodore J. Boutrous Jr.. a lawyer for Ms. Judd. said in an email on Wednesday.  The court correctly holds that California law forbids sexual harassment and retaliation by film producers and others in powerful positions. even outside the employment context. and we look forward to pursuing this claim against Mr Weinstein at trial.  Phyllis Kupferstein. a lawyer for Mr Weinstein. said in a statement that her client would be vindicated of the accusations made by Ms. Judd.  We are glad that both Ms. Judd and Mr Weinstein will have their day in court. where we expect the truth will come to light.  she said.  The most minimal investigation of the events will show that Mr Weinstein neither defamed Ms. Judd. nor hindered or interfered with her career. and certainly never retaliated against her and indeed. had nothing to retaliate for.  Ms. Kupferstein said that Mr Weinstein  fought  for Ms. Judd as his first choice for the lead role in the 1997 film  Good Will Hunting  and arranged for her to fly to New York to be considered for the part. She did not get it.  Ms. Judd contends that Mr Weinstein invited her to the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills in late 1996 or early 1997 to discuss movie roles. but instead of meeting in a public place. Mr Weinstein summoned her to his room. According to the lawsuit. Mr Weinstein. who was wearing a bathrobe. asked Ms. Judd for a massage and to watch him take a shower. After Ms. Judd declined. she contends. she was passed over for major roles. including being cast in the  Lord of the Rings  films. which made  2.5 billion in ticket sales and earned 30 Oscar nominations. Ms. Judd filed the lawsuit after the director and producer Peter Jackson came forward and said that he removed Ms. Judd from a  Lord of the Rings  casting list  as a direct result  of what he now thought was  false information  provided by Mr Weinstein. Ms. Judd’s lawsuit contends that Mr Weinstein told Mr Jackson and a producer that Mr Weinstein had a  bad experience  with Ms. Judd and that she was  a nightmare to work with.  Ms. Kupferstein said that Mr Weinstein had no authority over the  Lord of the Rings  franchise and that Ms. Judd was cast in two of Mr Weinstein’s projects. the 2002 film  Frida  and the 2009 film  Crossing Over.  ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/trump-chicago-federal-agents.html,Trump Sends In More Federal Agents, On Politics  When Biden said Trump was our first racist president. he might’ve been forgetting a few people. It’s Thursday. and this is your politics tip sheet.   We will never defund the police.  Trump said. hammering at a message that has become central to his re election campaign.  We will hire more great police. We want to make law enforcement stronger. not weaker. What cities are doing is absolute insanity.   Trump and William Barr. the US attorney general. told reporters that the administration would be sending officers to Chicago not to combat protesters but to help fight a recent rise in violent crime there.  We’re going to continue to confront mob violence.  Barr said.  But. the operations we are discussing today are very different  they are classic crime fighting.  The administration has also ordered agents into Kansas City. Mo.. with a similar mission. This seems to stretch the administration’s previously stated justifications for deploying federal officers into cities. Those rested on the executive order that Trump signed last month to protect monuments and statues. and on the D.H.S.’s original charter. which says that troops can be used to protect public property.   The deployment of unnamed special secret agents onto our streets to detain people without cause and to effectively take away their civil rights and civil liberties without due process  that is not going to happen in Chicago.  Lightfoot said. New York’s mayor. Bill de Blasio. has pledged to take Trump to court if he sends federal officers into the Big Apple. In Philadelphia. the district attorney. Larry Krasner. has also vowed to push back.  My dad volunteered and served in World War II to fight fascism. like most of my uncles. so we would not have an American president brutalizing and kidnapping Americans for exercising their constitutional rights and trying to make America a better place. which is what patriots do.  Krasner said in a statement this week.  Anyone. including federal law enforcement. who unlawfully assaults and kidnaps people will face criminal charges from my office.   The bipartisan vote. 305 to 113. could end up being moot  Mitch McConnell. the Senate majority leader. has criticized efforts to  airbrush the Capitol  as  clearly a bridge too far.  and seems unlikely to call it up for a vote. And even if the Senate passed it. Trump  who has made defending Confederate symbols part of his re election campaign  would probably veto it.     The way he deals with people based on the color of their skin. their national origin. where they’re from. is absolutely sickening.  Biden said.  We’ve had racists. and they existed and they tried to get elected president. He’s the first one that has.    The contract guarantees that the government will have access to 600 million doses of the vaccine. with at least 100 million available by December. The  1.95 billion contract covers the cost of the first batch. the other 500 million doses would need to be paid for in the future. The government does not pay anything until the drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the first 100 million doses are delivered. The move is aimed at significantly cutting down on the time it would take to manufacture and distribute a working vaccine. Pfizer and CureVac. the German firm. are just one of a number of teams worldwide racing to develop a vaccine. President Trump walked yesterday to a White House event about combating crime in cities. When Michael Bloomberg announced the formation of Everytown for Gun Safety. in 2013. his designs were explicitly nonpartisan. It would support any politician or group staunchly committed to gun control. Bloomberg said. with the goal of creating an equal and opposite force to combat the National Rifle Association. Technically. that remains true  Everytown is currently backing the campaign of exactly one congressional Republican up for re election. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick. who represents a suburban district in Pennsylvania.  In 2017 and 2019. for instance. its heavy investments in downballot races across Virginia helped to end a generation of Republican control of the State Legislature there.  Everytown has promised to spend a total of  60 million during the 2020 campaign. Of the initial  15 million outlay.  5 million will be spent entirely in Florida. the only state where the group has committed to advertising specifically on behalf of Biden. The rest of its expenditures will focus on congressional and state level races.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/world/europe/germany-synagogue-attack-trial.html,Trial Begins in Germany Over Synagogue Attack on Yom Kippur, A 28 year old racist is charged with murdering two people in an assault that raised alarm about the spread of right wing extremism online.   Stephan Balliet. 28. is charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of a 40 year old woman. who spoke up as Mr Balliet planted explosives around the entrance to the synagogue in the eastern city of Halle. and a 20 year old man he thought was a Muslim. He is also charged with 68 counts of attempted murder and other crimes for the attack last Oct. 9. If convicted of murder. Mr Balliet faces life in prison.  Mr Balliet was flown to the courtroom in Magdeburg hours before the trial opened. He wore a protective vest and jeans. and his hands and feet were in handcuffs and shackles similar to those of defendants who’ve faced terrorism charges. The trial had been moved from a smaller court in Naumburg to accommodate all of the participants and the news media. Dressed all in black. his face largely expressionless. Mr Balliet at first gave only curt responses when the presiding judge. Ursula Mertens. pressed him for details about his past. his family and his personal life. German media reported.  That’s not important.  he responded again and again. What was important to him was the year 2015. when Germany welcomed more than one million refugees. He said that was when he decided to turn his back on a society he described as  infiltrated  by Muslims and Black people. whom he used a racist slur to describe. eliciting a rebuke from Judge Mertens.  I will not accept the verbal abuse of people in this courtroom and have the authority to remove you.  she told him.  I will not tolerate further crimes in the courtroom by you slandering people.  The racist slurs and derogatory language Mr Balliet repeatedly sought to use echoed the hateful rants denouncing feminists and immigrants heard on a video he made of his attack using a camera mounted on a helmet. He broadcast his remarks live to an online chat platform. In the 35 minute video. which Mr Balliet said was inspired by the New Zealand massacres that were also livestreamed by the perpetrator. he declared.  The root of all these problems is the Jew.  Kai Lohse. a federal prosecutor. confirmed that Mr Balliet blamed Jews for the problems he identified in German society.  He described Jews as rats that had to be lured out of the synagogue  to be killed. Mr Lohse told the court. Prosecutors have found no indication the attacker was part of a larger network beyond the virtual world where he drew inspiration. Mr Balliet largely confessed. in the courtroom and earlier to prosecutors. to the charges against him. including the two counts of murder. His only remorse. he said. was that both people he killed were white. The death of the woman. identified only as Jana L.. in keeping with German privacy laws. was  not planned or wanted.  he said. but when she made a remark that upset him. he had no choice but to shoot her.  If I hadn’t done that. everyone would have laughed at me.  he said. explaining that because he was livestreaming the attack. those watching would have realized that  a stupid comment is enough to stop someone from the Right.  His intent. though. had been to empty his weapons inside the synagogue. he said. When he was thwarted by its heavy oak doors. he headed for a kebab shop and opened fire.  Someone was standing in the door and I shot him.  he told the court. adding that he had thought the man he killed. identified only as Kevin S.. was  Middle Eastern.  Dozens of the 52 people who had gathered for services in Halle’s Humboldt Street Synagogue last year on Yom Kippur. the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. were among those who packed the courtroom on Tuesday. In a statement released by their lawyer before the trial began. they expressed hope that the proceedings would draw attention to the role the internet plays in fueling far right hatred and the links between anti Semitism and other forms of hatred.  The perpetrator chose his targets on the basis of a white. racist ideology that fuses anti Semitism. Islamophobia. racism. homophobia. sexism and xenophobia with conspiracy theories.  they said.  His radicalization took place in online communities that strengthened and promoted these beliefs.   Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has since declared far right extremism the  biggest security threat facing Germany.  and promised a beefed up security response. However. minority rights activists and opposition leaders accuse the authorities of being too quick to write off individuals like Mr Balliet as lone actors with no connection to the societies in which they live.  He did not simply radicalize out of nowhere.  Cem Ozdimir. a lawmaker for the opposition Greens. told n tv television on Tuesday. adding that most extremists are men who are marked by misogyny. as well as hatred of Jews and Muslims.  It is important that the whole of society stands up.  he said.  and says we want to chase this hate back into hell. where it came from.  ,crimes

We hope to amplify the movement’s work and to call out our own industries for what they are  institutions that promote colonialism. capitalism. and racism. and that function in exploitative and destructive ways.  the letter read.  The letter closed with the demand that black artists have the freedom to shape how stories about blackness are told rather than listening to what overwhelmingly white institutions consider  marketable  or  palatable.  whether in television shows. novels. fashion. podcasting or the myriad disciplines that the 1.000 plus names represent. ,crimes

The problem is that. while these shows of support were well intentioned. they didn’t address the way that these companies’ own products  Facebook.

It’s as if the heads of McDonald’s. Burger King and Taco Bell all got together to fight obesity by donating to a vegan food co op. rather than by lowering their calorie counts. It’s hard to remember sometimes. but social media once functioned as a tool for the oppressed and marginalized. In Tahrir Square in Cairo. Ferguson. Mo.. and Baltimore. activists used Twitter and Facebook to organize demonstrations and get their messages out. But in recent years. a right wing reactionary movement has turned the tide. Now. some of the loudest and most established voices on these platforms belong to conservative commentators and paid provocateurs whose aim is mocking and subverting social justice movements. rather than supporting them.  transcript In the summer of 2014. Michael Brown. an unarmed black teenager. was shot and killed by Darren Wilson. a white police officer in Ferguson. Missouri. And for weeks  I said indict. convict  Send that killer cop to jail   there were protests in Ferguson and across the country. And social media really became the primary organizing tool for the Black Lives Matter movement. Hands up  Don’t shoot  Hands up  Don’t shoot  And back in 2014. if you remember. like. you would go on Twitter or Facebook and almost every post in your feed. or most of the posts in your feed. would be some sort of call to action.

Black Lives Matter. Right. and it feels like we’re in a very similar moment right now. So what do things look like on a Facebook. for instance. at this moment  Well. they look a little different. All lives matter. It’s overwhelmingly posts that oppose Black Lives Matter. You got to explain this to people  All lives matter. Calling it a racist movement. The Black Lives Matter foundation is apparently preparing for a quote.  war on police.  Black Lives Matter is the Khan of the century and a sham. We gonna find out how many liberals have contributed. Some could have possibly orchestrated and manufactured a lot of stuff  A lot of stuff.  that we see today. About how Black Lives Matter is not a social justice movement. It is something far darker and more dangerous. I mean. Kevin. how do you explain that  Because how did  BlackLivesMatter go from being a very powerful organizing tool that helped give birth to a movement. to something that’s now being used to undermine and even hijack it  Well. I think it’s important to remember that a majority of Americans support Black Lives Matter. You know. the data we have suggests that Black Lives Matter is actually much more popular among Americans than it was in 2014. I think the thing that has changed is social media. From The New York Times. I’m Michael Barbaro. This is  The Daily.  Today  Facebook and Twitter are publicly voicing support for Black Lives Matter and its mission in this moment. But my colleague. Kevin Roose. took a close look at what’s actually happened on their platforms. It’s Monday. June 22. Kevin. you just spent the past few months making a series about the rise of extremism on the internet   Rabbit Hole.  Right. But the last time you and I talked here on  The Daily  it was back in the fall. And the two biggest names in social media. Facebook and Twitter. were under fire for the huge amount of misinformation on their platforms. And Congress brought the heads of those companies  Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook. Jack Dorsey from Twitter  out to testify. And it felt like a pretty defining moment for them when it comes to this question of. what is the role of a social media company in our civic discourse  So what has happened since then  Well. I think these social networks have continued to grapple with these questions of responsibility and free speech and what’s allowed and what’s not allowed on their platforms. We face a number of important issues around privacy. safety and democracy. And I think every social media company has realized that they dropped the ball in 2016. But it’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well. They allowed their platforms to be hijacked. not just by Russia. but by dishonest actors inside America. by partisan media outlets and clickbait factories. We didn’t take a broad enough view of our responsibility. and that was a big mistake. So they’re basically in this grappling moment. Like. they realize that what happens in November is pretty existential for them. Overall. I would say that we’re going through a broader philosophical shift in how we  They will be either seen as helping the democratic process and free and fair elections in the US Or they will be seen as they were in 2016. as having. in some ways. undermined it. I started Facebook. I run it. And I’m responsible for what happens here. And they have committed to getting it right. or more right in 2020. And do we see these companies start to take action eventually after this period of grappling  Yeah. so the first hint that these companies were going to be somewhat different from one another. when it came to enforcing these new rules. happened last year  Twitter is going to stop accepting political ads on the platform. Jack Dorsey has just tweeted it out.  when Twitter decided to ban all political advertisements. And he says while internet advertising is an incredibly powerful and very effective tool for commercial advertisers. the power brings significant risk to politics. where it can be used to influence votes that affect the lives of millions. So if you’re a politician or a super PAC or a lobbying organization. you cannot take out a political ad on Twitter. They said these sort of targeted ads distort democracy. We don’t feel like we can responsibly administer them. And so they just said. we don’t want any part of it when it comes to political ads. And what about Facebook  Facebook took a much different tack. They basically said. we will continue to allow political advertisements. campaigns. outside groups will be able to spend millions of dollars on political ads. And even more so. we will not fact check politicians’ ads. But outside of this political advertising decision. the policies that Facebook and Twitter have  with respect to what is and isn’t allowed on their platforms  they’re very similar. except when it comes to one particular user  President Trump. What do you mean  So Twitter. in recent weeks. has become much more aggressive in confronting President Trump over some of his tweets that they say violate their rules. Twitter. for the very first time is fact checking the president. The first one was this tweet about mail in ballots that President Trump had that had some misleading and false information about voting. He claimed. without evidence. that voting by mail leads to fraud. Twitter says that the tweets are potentially misleading. And that. Twitter said. was a clear violation of its policies around voting misinformation. So they put a sort of fact checking label on those tweets. and Facebook did not. And. Kevin. this fact checking label essentially says to anyone who looks at this. hey. there’s some issues here. and you shouldn’t take this at face value. Right. so Twitter applies this fact checking label to President Trump’s tweets. And then the very next day  We’ve been sharing with you President Donald Trump’s recent tweets about the unrest in Minnesota. President Trump put out this statement. which he posted to Twitter and also to Facebook. Here’s a quote   These thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd. and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to governor Tim Walls and told him that the military is with him all the way.   any difficulty. and we will assume control.  But when the looting starts. the shooting starts.   The shooting starts.  the words of the president.  When the looting starts. the shooting starts.  What does that mean  It’s a phrase with a very long history. It was fused by a police chief in Miami in the late 1960s. And he was referring to violence against protesters. And so in this context. it was clear that the president was threatening violence against protesters. Which would make this a real test of Facebook and Twitter’s social media policy  Right. both these networks have policies prohibiting violent incitement. posts that could create imminent harm to people. And this clearly fell under that category. And so what did the companies decide to do  So Twitter decided to put basically a warning label on this tweet saying that it had violated their rules about glorifying violence. but that it would stay up because it was in the public’s interest to know about it. And they also made it so that you couldn’t retweet it. And how big of a deal is it that Twitter took those steps  Well. I think practically. it didn’t do much. I mean. I think people still heard about this tweet. They still saw it. But I think. symbolically it was a very big deal. It was the first time that Twitter had ever applied this label to President Trump. And it was sort of a moment where they were saying like. this is a line that even President Trump cannot cross. And how does Facebook handle this very same post from President Trump  So Facebook sort of waits awhile. and then they announce that they’re just going to leave it up. They’re not going to label it. They’re not going to take it down. This post will just stay up. And Kevin. why is the reaction by these two giant social media companies so completely different  Well. part of it. I think. has to do with who’s running these companies. The founder of San Francisco based Twitter is getting involved in the protest in Ferguson. Jack Dorsey is from St. Louis. just 12 miles from Ferguson. Jack Dorsey. the C.E.O. of Twitter. he’s been very vocal about his support for Black Lives Matter and for sort of Twitter’s role in helping these movements be heard. The billionaire was on the streets of Ferguson last week and has been marching. posting vines and tweets about all that’s going there. But he also knows his users pretty well. I mean. Twitter is a place where a lot of activists and journalists hang out. It’s also got like a robust and vibrant black community on Twitter. And I think he just understands that many of his users are going to feel pretty good about this decision to take on the president. Now. I’m not going to sit here and tell you that we’re going to catch all bad content in our system. But Mark Zuckerberg on the other hand. he doesn’t want to be the referee. We don’t check what people say before they say it. And frankly. I don’t think society should want us to. He doesn’t want to be an arbiter of civil conversation. Freedom means you don’t have to ask for permission first. And that by default. you can say what you want. When it comes to politicians. he wants to do as little moderation as possible. And in some ways. that lines up better with what Facebook users want. They tend to be a little older. potentially more conservative. Right. so therefore. Mark Zuckerberg would be very reluctant to label the president’s tweet as factually inaccurate. or label it as potentially inciting violence. because that may very quickly alienate Facebook users. Right. but I think an even bigger risk is that it could alienate President Trump and Republican lawmakers in Washington. The giant tech companies right now are eating up little tiny businesses. startups. and competing unfairly. In this election cycle. Facebook has become sort of a target for Democrats. So what I’m saying is we got to break these guys apart. You want to run a platform  That’s fine. You don’t get to run a whole bunch of the businesses as well. But Facebook has been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans who have said that they should be broken up or more heavily regulated. So quit harvesting people’s data. sell off these companies that you’re using to create a monopoly. and do a third party audit. I think Facebook knows that Democrats in some ways have turned against them. And if Republicans also turn against them. it will be that much harder for them to stop new regulation for them to avoid being broken up. And I think that it’s in their interest to keep President Trump and his allies happy. That’s really interesting. because I feel like the dominant conservative view  at least as I understand it and have read about it  is that Facebook has not been hospitable to conservatives. that it has taken steps to censor them or limit what they say. And from what you’re describing. Facebook very much needs conservatives and is showing a lot of restraint when it comes to conservatives. Yeah. I mean. their outreach to Republicans is. in some ways. an attempt to sort of correct this impression that conservatives have. that they are biased against the right. which is not reflected in any of the data. And I’ve actually been looking at this pretty regularly for the past few weeks. There’s this tool called CrowdTangle that you can basically use to pull up the most popular and talked about Facebook posts from across all of Facebook. So yeah. just looking at the most engaged posts from the last 24 hours on Facebook. the first one is from Trump. It’s the video of his rally in Tulsa. Oklahoma. Number two. also by Trump. another picture from his rally. And then you’ve got Franklin Graham. this right wing evangelist and activist taking issue with Dr. Fauci. You’ve got Hugh Jackman wishing his dad a happy father’s day. That one’s not political. And you’ve got Terrence Williams. who’s a pro Trump activist. Breitbart has a video of Trump’s rally. The vast majority of these top 10 stories are usually from right wing media outlets and right wing politicians. Is there anything that might be characterized as Democratic. liberal or progressive in that list of the top 10 or so  Almost every day there are one or two posts in the top 10 from more liberal outlets or politicians. But it is predominated by Fox News. by Breitbart. by right wing news outlets and by President Trump himself. So it looks like what you just went through makes clear that Facebook’s users. and maybe its most active users are conservatives. right  It’s not a question of an algorithm that puts those things at the top. It’s what’s being most discussed. engaged. commented on. Yeah. there’s clearly a large audience for conservative media. conservative posts. conservative activism on Facebook. We’ll be right back. Kevin. what you’re describing is a very fascinating dynamic. Facebook fears a backlash from conservatives. But in some ways. it doesn’t need to fear a backlash from conservatives. because it has made itself a very hospitable place for conservatives. But that fear means it has no incentive to do anything to crack down on conservative viewpoints. no matter how extreme or factually inaccurate. In some ways that’s right. Except there’s one complicating factor. which is that Facebook own employees are increasingly speaking out. We are following a developing story out of Facebook. Employees staging a virtual walkout today in protest of the company’s policies toward some of President Trump’s posts. Let’s get to Julie  There was a virtual walkout recently where a bunch of employees sort of protested these decisions by sort of logging off for the day. Meantime. you’ve got Facebook employees resigning today. publicly resigning because of this decision. There have even been employees who have resigned over Mark Zuckerberg’s decisions to essentially let Trump get away with things that other users wouldn’t be able to. Facebook’s employees. you know. many of them  they live in Silicon Valley. They tend to be more liberal. They don’t like the idea that the product that they spend their days and nights building is being used to put out propaganda and misinformation. Employees like Andrew Crow. head of design for Facebook’s portal product. have taken to Twitter. writing comments such as. quote.  Giving a platform to incite violence and spread disinformation is unacceptable.  And they have started vocally objecting to Mark Zuckerberg’s decisions. While Jason Toff. identified as director of product management wrote. quote.  I work at Facebook. and I am not proud of how we’re showing up.  And that’s a real pressure. because Silicon Valley is a very interesting place in that the employees of these companies wield a ton of power. It’s a very competitive labor market. And if you’re Facebook. you can’t afford to have your employees be walking out and resigning. It’s not right for your business long term. Kevin. from everything you’ve just said. Twitter is being proactive here. Facebook. much less so. But I just want to make sure that we’re not oversimplifying this. Because yes. we know Twitter has chosen to label certain tweets. at least by the president. as violating their terms. fact check them. We know that they have taken a pass on political ads. and that Facebook has not done any of those. But in reality. is what Twitter is doing meaningfully different and better than what Facebook is doing  I mean. Twitter still has a lot of work to do to ensure that people are not threatening and harassing and using hate speech against each other. But the thing that I think is really starting to differentiate these companies from one another is how they’re responding to this moment. you know. this historic movement for civil rights. this historic election where in some ways. you know. a lot of people feel like that the future of. not just the next four years. but of democracy is on the line. And I think these companies are understanding that they will be judged by history. in some ways. for the decisions that they make right now. And what could they be doing that neither of them are doing  Well. there’s plenty of things that they could do to kind of take down the temperature of the overall conversation on their platforms. They could change the way that their systems rank information. So instead of showing you the stuff that is most engaging. they could more heavily curate the information that comes onto people’s feeds. They could put a cap on like how viral posts can go to sort of keep bad actors from hijacking these conversations and undermining these movements. There’s a lot that they could tweak about the basic structures of their platforms. But that could cut pretty deeply into their business models. And ultimately. like. I think the bigger thing that they’re realizing is that they have to pick a side. There is no such thing as a neutral platform. And all these decisions that they make about how their tools are designed. how they’re used. what policies they have. they are all pushing in one direction or the other. And in this moment. this national moment of reckoning. of activism. of people speaking out against injustice. they have to decide whether that’s something that they want to support or whether they want to stand on the sidelines. Right. because if you don’t pick a side as a social media platform. then a side will be picked by your users. Exactly. I mean I think a pretty vivid illustration of this happened the other day. when Mark Zuckerberg came out with this long. heartfelt Facebook post about how he supported Black Lives Matter. how Facebook was going to donate millions of dollars to racial justice causes. how he stood with Facebook’s black employees and with the movement for racial justice. And that same day  Hello. Facebook family   on Facebook   I have decided to do this video   the post that was going the most viral   it has been weighing very heavily on my heart   was this video by this conservative activist Candace Owens  So in my opinion. George Floyd was a criminal. He was a criminal. And just because he was a criminal doesn’t mean he deserved to die at the knee of a police officer. But it does mean that I am not going to play a part of the broken black culture that always wants to martyr criminals.  who made an entire video essentially saying that Black Lives Matter was a liberal hoax. And there’s certainly no excuse to accept the democrat narrative. OK. that black people are being disproportionately hunted down by police officers because of the color of their skin. That George Floyd was a horrible person. that his death should not be mourned as a tragedy. and essentially saying that this whole movement is based on a false premise. Police brutality. racially motivated police brutality is a myth. That there is no bias in policing in America. I have  you know. I have no apologies here to make. George Floyd is not my martyr. He can be yours. And that’s all I have to say to black America. So Mark Zuckerberg is out there saying I believe in Black Lives Matter. I want to support this movement. And on his platform. the thing that he built. the thing that he oversees and controls every day. a very different message was winning. Kevin. thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you for having me. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that over the past week. the number of new daily infections of the coronavirus has hit a record high in 12 states. most in the Southwest and Midwest. but that the death rate is falling dramatically. Overall. fatalities from the virus have dropped 42 percent over the past two weeks. in part it is believed. because the virus is infecting younger and healthier Americans. And President Trump has fired the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. who has overseen multiple investigations into conduct by the president. the president’s lawyers. and the president’s allies. The US attorney. Geoffrey Berman. initially rejected a recommendation from the attorney General. Bill Barr to resign. prompting Barr to announce his resignation and for Berman to publicly deny that he was resigning. Berman eventually agreed to step aside after learning that one of his deputies would fill his role for the foreseeable future. That’s it for  The Daily.  I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.   Ms. Owens is a serial offender. known for spreading misinformation and stirring up partisan rancor.  Her Twitter account was suspended this year after she encouraged her followers to violate stay at home orders. and Facebook has applied fact checking labels to several of her posts.  But she can still insult the victims of police killings with impunity to her nearly four million followers on Facebook. So can other high profile conservative commentators like Terrence K. Williams. Ben Shapiro and the Hodgetwins. all of whom have had anti Black Lives Matter posts go viral over the past several weeks. In all. seven of the 10 most shared Facebook posts containing the phrase  Black Lives Matter  over the past month were critical of the movement. according to data from CrowdTangle. a Facebook owned data platform.  The sentiment on Instagram. which Facebook owns. has been more favorable. perhaps because its users skew younger and more liberal.    A Twitter spokesman. Brandon Borrman. said   We’ve taken down hundreds of groups under our violent extremist group policy and continue to enforce our policies against hateful conduct every day across the world. From  BlackLivesMatter to  MeToo and  BringBackOurGirls. our company is motivated by the power of social movements to usher in meaningful societal change.    A YouTube spokeswoman. Andrea Faville. said that Mr Saladino’s video had received fewer than 5 percent of its views this year. and that it was not being widely recommended by the company’s algorithms. Mr Saladino recently reposted the video to Facebook. where it has gotten several million more views. In some ways. social media has helped Black Lives Matter simply by making it possible for victims of police violence to be heard. Without Facebook. Twitter and YouTube. we might never have seen the video of Mr Floyd’s killing or known about Breonna Taylor or other victims of police brutality. Many of the protests being held around the country are being organized in Facebook groups and Twitter threads. and social media has been helpful in creating more accountability for the police. But these platforms aren’t just megaphones. They’re also global. real time contests for attention. and many of the experienced players have gotten good at provoking controversy by adopting exaggerated views. They understand that if the whole world is condemning Mr Floyd’s killing. a post saying he deserved it will stand out. If the data suggests that black people are disproportionately targeted by police violence. they know that there’s likely a market for a video saying that white people are the real victims. The point isn’t that platforms should bar people like Mr Saladino and Ms. Owens for criticizing Black Lives Matter. But in this moment of racial reckoning. these executives owe it to their employees. their users and society at large to examine the structural forces that are empowering racists on the internet. and which features of their platforms are undermining the social justice movements they claim to support.   Rashad Robinson. the president of Color of Change. a civil rights group that advises tech companies on racial justice issues. told me in an interview this week that tech leaders needed to apply anti racist principles to their own product designs. rather than simply expressing their support for Black Lives Matter.  What I see. particularly from Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg. it’s kind of like ‘thoughts and prayers’ after something tragic happens with guns.  Mr Robinson said.  It’s a lot of sympathy without having to do anything structural about it.  There is plenty more Mr Zuckerberg. Mr Dorsey and Ms. Wojcicki could do. They could build teams of civil rights experts and empower them to root out racism on their platforms. including more subtle forms of racism that don’t involve using racial slurs or organized hate groups. They could dismantle the recommendations systems that give provocateurs and cranks free attention. or make changes to the way their platforms rank information.  Ranking it by how engaging it is. the way some platforms still do. tends to amplify misinformation and outrage bait.  They could institute a  viral ceiling  on posts about sensitive topics. to make it harder for trolls to hijack the conversation. I’m optimistic that some of these tech leaders will eventually be convinced  either by their employees of color or their own conscience  that truly supporting racial justice means that they need to build anti racist products and services. and do the hard work of making sure their platforms are amplifying the right voices. But I’m worried that they will stop short of making real. structural changes. out of fear of being accused of partisan bias. So is Mr Robinson. the civil rights organizer. A few weeks ago. he chatted with Mr Zuckerberg by phone about Facebook’s policies on race. elections and other topics. Afterward. he said he thought that while Mr Zuckerberg and other tech leaders generally meant well. he didn’t think they truly understood how harmful their products could be.  I don’t think they can truly mean ‘Black Lives Matter’ when they have systems that put black people at risk.  he said. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/opinion/mcgirt-native-reservation-implications.html,This 19th-Century Law Helps Shape Criminal Justice in Indian Country,Opinion And that’s a problem  especially for Native American women. and especially in rape cases.  Supported by  Mr Weiden is a professor of Native American studies.  Under the doctrine of tribal sovereignty. the state of Oklahoma could no longer prosecute serious felony cases involving Native Americans on reservation land. But there was little clarity about other critical jurisdictional questions. Shortly after the McGirt decision was handed down. the Oklahoma attorney general and five Native nations in Oklahoma agreed that the state would continue to prosecute crimes committed by non Native Americans on reservation lands. Tribal authorities would possess joint jurisdiction over Native offenders for most crimes.  The Major Crimes Act gives the federal government exclusive criminal jurisdiction  investigation. trial and corrections  for major felony crimes that occur on Native American reservations. Congress passed the law after the murder of a well known Native leader from my own nation. the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. In that case. Chief Spotted Tail was assassinated by one of his own people. Crow Dog. for reasons that are not clear. Shortly after the murder. tribal elders met and decided upon the restitution  money. goods and horses  that Crow Dog’s family would pay to Spotted Tail’s people. Traditional Lakota law relied heavily upon the principle of restorative justice. and the arrangement satisfied both families. But the Native principle of justice and reparations offended many American lawmakers. who held radically different views on punishment and retribution. and viewed the penalty as being too lenient. So Crow Dog was arrested by state police. charged with murder in federal court and sentenced to death by hanging. But Crow Dog’s lawyer petitioned the United States Supreme Court. which ruled that the federal government had no right to intervene in an Indian nation’s criminal affairs absent an act of Congress. Crow Dog was freed. But Congress passed the Major Crimes Act. thus ensuring American Indians would never again have the authority to decide the outcome of any serious felony case. But that hasn’t helped Native Americans. Today. crime rates on reservations are much higher than average for nearly every serious offense. in part because of the Major Crimes Act. Because of the jurisdictional complexity of prosecuting these cases. criminal justice enforcement on many reservations is too often disorganized and disordered. Is the victim a Native American  What about the offender  Did the crime take place on Native territory  If a serious felony crime is committed on a reservation by a Native person. the state or tribal police are obligated to refer the case to the FBI or another federal agency. If the agency accepts the referral. it conducts the investigation and makes a recommendation to federal prosecutors for trial in federal court. But here’s the problem  Federal authorities have the right to decline prosecutions in serious felony crimes on Native lands. even when the perpetrator has been arrested. And they frequently do. And. at that point. the offender is usually set free.  Why are federal authorities declining to prosecute serious crimes occurring in Native territories  The most typical reasons are. reportedly. insufficient evidence. failure to meet the statutory definition of a crime or failure to satisfy the prosecution guidelines of the US Attorney’s Office.  Furthermore. tribal courts are generally powerless to prosecute non Native offenders. When amended in 2013. the Violence Against Women Act did expand the authority of Native nations to prosecute non Native sex offenders. but few Native nations have the resources to implement the program. As of 2019. fewer than 30 reservations have successfully done so.  This Court decision is unlikely to make things better. It’s certainly possible that Native Americans previously prosecuted and convicted in state courts will challenge their convictions and seek new trials in the federal system. It’s also possible that federal authorities will be overwhelmed by the new influx of cases.     ,crimes

I’m Julian Assange. and I’m here to  because because we’ve got to get him out of the cage. You know. why. why. you know. if they put Julian in a concrete jail. then they’re supposed to put the editors of The Guardian and Der Spiegel and New York Times because they also told the truth. And it’s not a crime to tell the truth.    But just after 8 a.m. Tuesday. a yelling scrum of photographers. reporters and protesters spilled across the sidewalks and into the road outside London’s central criminal court. the Old Bailey. to watch a 79 year old woman dressed in a yellow trouser suit and baseball cap suspend herself inside a bird cage 10 feet in the air. squawking at the top of her lungs.     I am Julian Assange.  Ms. Westwood continued. legs swinging in the breeze. as a garbage truck pulled over and started to reverse loudly down a small side street. Several bemused members of the court staff peered through the Old Bailey’s large archways to get a look at the unfolding commotion. while a white van driver tooted his horn in appreciation.  And I am a canary. I am half poisoned already from government corruption and gaming of the system and legal system by governments.  Ms. Westwood said. The designer  who used salty language throughout her speech  said she was  still whistling away  while the world’s 7 billion people did not know what was going on.    For the last year Mr Assange has been held at Belmarsh Prison in London. and. if he is successfully extradited. he could face as many as 175 years in prison if found guilty on all charges. After several minutes on the megaphone and then being carefully winched to safety. Ms. Westwood pretended to be a bird by screeching at her cage for photographers as protesters held up  Free Assange  banners nearby. Later. she explained that her activist son. Joe Corré. a  captain  of a campaign in defense of Mr Assange. was the mastermind behind the protest. Mr Corré. who founded the underwear label Agent Provocateur. turned down a Member of the Order of the British Empire honor in 2007 in a protest against Britain’s participation in the Iraq war.  There’s no time to spare now whatsoever.  Ms. Westwood said as she pulled on a face mask.  If Julian gets sent to America. it is the worst thing that could happen in the world for justice and freedom of speech. This could happen to every journalist.  Ms. Westwood also said that. despite being a designer in business for more than 50 years. she hadn’t spent that much time fashioning her canary outfit.  It was the only thing I could find that was yellow. though I did try hard to make my eyes look like that of a bird  can you see.  she said. widening them to show off the wild multicolored plumes of crayon swirls that swept up her temples.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/world/africa/sudan-omar-hassan-al-bashir-coup-trial.html,Three Decades After His Coup  Sudan’s Former Ruler Is Held to Account, Omar Hassan al Bashir. ousted in mass protests last year. is on trial for his role in the military coup that propelled him to power in 1989. He faces the death penalty if convicted.  CAIRO  Three decades ago. a little known army officer named Omar Hassan al Bashir seized power in Sudan. ushering in a long period of brutal rule that would push the sprawling African country into a series of destabilizing wars. cripple its economy and result in humiliating international isolation. Now Mr al Bashir is being called to account for his actions.  Mr al Bashir. who was sentenced to two years imprisonment last year on separate corruption charges. faces the death penalty if convicted. Armed policemen wielding batons and tear gas canisters stood guard outside the courthouse. where the accused were led into cages for a brief hearing. Dozens of relatives gathered outside the building. jeering and shouting slogans including  God is great     For over a decade. the International Criminal Court at The Hague has sought Mr al Bashir over his role in the conflict in the western region of Darfur. where Sudanese troops and allied militias killed. pillaged and raped in a yearslong campaign of ethnically driven violence that resulted in several hundred thousand deaths. The Hague court indicted Mr al Bashir a decade ago on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. and charged other senior figures including the former defense minister. Abdel Rahim Muhammad Hussein. who stood trial alongside Mr al Bashir on Tuesday. Although Sudan’s transitional government. which is jointly led by civilian and military leaders. indicated earlier this year that it was ready to send Mr al Bashir to The Hague. there has been little sign of that happening. Instead. the new administration has appeared to shy away from a trial on Darfur. probably because its own leaders might also face accusations.   After he seized power. Mr al Bashir suspended the Parliament and other state institutions. closed Khartoum airport and announced the coup over the radio. Later. he embarked on a vicious purge of potential rivals. imposed Islamic law. and introduced harsh laws that severely restricted freedoms for Sudanese. especially for women. It quickly became clear that the ideological drive for the putsch came from a small group of Islamists led by Mr al Turabi. an erudite. Sorbonne educated cleric who dreamed of leading a Pan Arab Islamist renaissance. Mr al Bashir had a reputation as a malleable. less sophisticated figure.  Bashir was the frontman but the Islamists were more powerful.  said Alex de Waal. a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. and an expert on Sudan.  They manipulated him.  But Mr al Bashir outwitted the ideologues in a series of power struggles that ended with Mr Turabi’s imprisonment in 1999. leaving Mr al Bashir as Sudan’s unchallenged ruler. Sudan was home to Osama bin Laden until 1996. when under American pressure Mr al Bashir was forced to expel the Qaeda leader. Later. Mr al Bashir softened his Islamist fervor in favor of repairing relations with Sudan’s neighbors and. in 2005. striking a landmark peace deal with southern rebels that led to independence for South Sudan in 2011. Mr al Bashir’s iron grip collapsed in April 2019 when. after months of street protests triggered by the price of bread. his own army lieutenants decided his rule had become untenable and ousted him from power. Mr al Bashir has dismissed the charges over the 1989 coup as politically motivated   a political trial par excellence.  one of his lawyers told reporters in December  and footage of Tuesday’s proceedings broadcast on state TV focused on the judge and did not show the ousted autocrat in the packed courtroom. For many Sudanese. though. it was also striking to see the former vice presidents Ali Osman Taha and Bakri Hassan Saleh on trial. Without hearing statements or arguments. the judge adjourned the trial until Aug. 11. when he said it would reconvene in a larger courtroom with more space for relatives and the defendants. ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/world/asia/thailand-crash-red-bull-heir.html,Thailand Drops All Charges Against Red Bull Heir in Deadly Crash, Vorayuth Yoovidhaya. grandson of the energy drinks inventor. had fled the country after striking a police officer with his car in Bangkok in 2012.  BANGKOK  The police in Thailand said they had dropped the last remaining charges against a wealthy playboy on Friday. eight years after he struck and killed an officer with his Ferrari and fled the country. The announcement ended a yearslong drama that included the issuance of an international arrest warrant for the heir to one of the country’s most storied companies and largest fortunes and a public outcry over the seemingly separate system of justice for the country’s richest people. Just before dawn on a dark Bangkok street on a September night in 2012. a speeding Ferrari struck and killed a motorcycle police officer. The driver fled the scene. but a trail of leaking engine fluid led the police to his door  and the damaged Ferrari  a short distance away. The police arrested the driver. Vorayuth Yoovidhaya. the grandson of the inventor of the Red Bull energy drink and heir to one of Thailand’s greatest fortunes. The police said at the time that he had been intoxicated and admitted that his car hit the officer. Wichean Glanprasert.  On Friday. the police said they were dropping the last charge in the case. reckless driving resulting in someone’s death. and were withdrawing Thai and Interpol warrants for his arrest. A police spokesman. Col. Krisana Pattanajaroen. said the police had followed all proper procedures in the case.  It’s quite normal.  he said.  We strictly followed the protocol here.  The process of withdrawing the arrest warrants will be completed soon and Mr Vorayuth. 37. who goes by nickname  Boss.  will be able to return to Thailand if he wishes.  After that. he’ll be free.  Colonel Krisana said. During the investigation. Mr Vorayuth repeatedly ignored police summonses. He fled the country in 2017. shortly before the first arrest warrant was issued. Three charges  speeding. hit and run driving and reckless driving causing damage to another person  were dropped earlier because the statute of limitations had expired.  Prosecutors decided to close the case last month. but news of the decision did not surface until this week. In a June 18 letter to Mr Vorayuth. a police deputy director of investigations. Lt. Col. Thanawut Sanguansuk. informed him of the decision.  This case is therefore terminated in accordance with the legal process.  the letter said. The outcome was what the family of Mr Wichean. the motorcycle officer. expected long ago. Mr Vorayuth  is powerful. has many connections and a lot of money.  the officer’s older brother. Pornanand Glanprasert. said in a 2013 interview.  If you are common people like us. I think the case is already finished.  he said.  He is going to try very hard not to be charged  or at the very least to get a suspended sentence or no punishment at all.  ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/world/middleeast/Saudi-spy-mbs-extradition.html,A Saudi Spy Chief Hid Abroad. With Appeals and Threats  M.B.S. Tried to Bring Him Back, To try to force a former Saudi intelligence officer to return to the kingdom. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked for his help. targeted his family and sought to have him arrested abroad.  BEIRUT. Lebanon  As Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia sidelined rivals to consolidate power a few years ago. a former Saudi intelligence official feared that he would end up in the prince’s sights and slipped out of the kingdom. The prince has been trying to get him back since. first asking the former official. Saad Aljabri. to come home for a new job. then trying unsuccessfully to have him extradited on corruption charges through Interpol. according to text messages and legal documents reviewed by The New York Times.  You are involved in many large cases of corruption that have been proven.  Prince Mohammed wrote to the former official in September 2017.  There is no state in the world that would refuse to turn you over.  But Interpol questioned the Saudi commitment to due process and human rights in the kingdom’s handling of corruption cases and deemed the Saudi request for Mr Aljabri politically motivated. a violation of the organization’s rules. according to Interpol documents. So it removed Mr Aljabri’s name from its system. The text messages and documents reviewed by The Times. which have not been previously reported. shed new light on how far Prince Mohammed has reached to exert control over Saudis he fears could subvert him.    Since his father became king in 2015. Prince Mohammed. 34. has taken charge of military. economic and social policies while targeting critics and foes with travel bans. detentions and lawsuits.  The Saudi moves against Mr Aljabri have drawn attention in Washington. where many officials considered him a valuable intelligence partner.  Officials at the Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment about the text messages between Prince Mohammed and Mr Aljabri. the Saudi Interpol request or the kingdom’s corruption allegations.  Mr Aljabri’s rise and fall were tied to his association with Prince Mohammed’s primary rival for the Saudi throne. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. who headed the Interior Ministry and became crown prince in 2015. A linguist with a doctorate in artificial intelligence. Mr Aljabri became a top official at the ministry. which handles security and counterterrorism. putting him in regular contact with US diplomats and officials from the Central Intelligence Agency. Many have praised his professionalism.  But Mr Aljabri’s star fell as Prince Mohammed’s rose. Mr Aljabri was dismissed by royal decree in 2015. In 2017. Mr Aljabri began to fear that Prince Mohammed intended to replace Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince and target his domestic allies. so Mr Aljabri left the kingdom. settling in Turkey. On June 18 of that year. Prince Mohammed texted him. asking Mr Aljabri to return to help solve an unspecified issue with Mohammed bin Nayef. according to translated versions of texts provided by Mr Aljabri’s law firm.  I want to explain to you what has happened recently and come to an agreement with you about a strategy to solve all these difficulties.  Prince Mohammed wrote. Mr Aljabri replied that he was  prepared to accept whatever you command.  Prince Mohammed said he wanted the three men to meet so they could  reconcile and everything can return to the way it was.  On June 20. Mr Aljabri said he could not return to Saudi Arabia immediately because of medical treatment. Prince Mohammed said he had only summoned him because he was  in dire need of your assistance.   Mr Aljabri wrote to pledge allegiance to Prince Mohammed as crown prince. and Prince Mohammed encouraged him to return for an important new job.  When you return safely. I will explain to you the background to the problem.  Prince Mohammed wrote.  I will still need you to deal with anyone who attempts to create disorder and conflict.  Mr Aljabri asked Prince Mohammed to lift the travel ban on his children. Prince Mohammed did not respond. Three months later. Mr Aljabri asked Prince Mohammed again to lift the travel ban  to allow them to leave so that they may finish their studies.   When I see you. I will explain to you the background.  Prince Mohammed responded. Mr Aljabri repeated his request.  When I see you. I will explain everything to you.  Prince Mohammed wrote. A few days later. Prince Mohammed asked Mr Aljabri to return to Saudi Arabia the next day. linking his return to the travel ban on Mr Aljabri’s children.  I want to resolve this problem of your son and daughter. but this is a very sensitive file here  related to Mohammed bin Nayef. Prince Mohammed wrote.  I want your opinion about it as well as information from you concerning it. I also want to come to an understanding with you regarding your future situation and what the details should be.  Soon after. Prince Mohammed texted again. this time threatening to have Mr Aljabri arrested abroad. With the danger now clear. Mr Aljabri moved from Turkey to Canada. according to his son. Khalid Aljabri. a cardiologist also based in Canada. To try to force him home. the Saudi authorities filed a notice with Interpol. the international police organization. asking other nations to help with Mr Aljabri’s extradition. according to Interpol documents.  Mr Aljabri confirmed that his name was in the Interpol system in December 2017. when his wife and other relatives were barred from flying from Turkey to Canada because their party contained another Saad Aljabri  Mr Aljabri’s infant grandson and namesake. Dr. Aljabri said. The family nonetheless managed to get to Canada via the United States and appealed the inclusion of Mr Aljabri’s name in the Interpol system. They won in July 2018. according to an Interpol document about the decision. It did not detail the charges Saudi Arabia had made against Mr Aljabri or any evidence the kingdom had provided. But in rejecting the Saudi request. the commission criticized the kingdom’s previous handling of corruption cases for  the lack of due process and human rights guarantees.   The Interpol commission wrote that the anti corruption committee that oversaw that crackdown was  part of a political strategy by MBS to target any potential political rival or opposition.  The kingdom soon found other ways to pressure Mr Aljabri. In March. his two adult children who had been barred from leaving the kingdom were arrested in their Riyadh home. In May.

Rockefeller. he steered one of his family’s philanthropies to a feisty stance on the oil giant’s role in climate change.  David Kaiser. a scion of the Rockefeller family who steered one of its philanthropies into a pitched confrontation with the company that provided the family’s prodigious wealth. died on Wednesday at a family home on Mount Desert Island. Maine. He was 50. The cause was glioblastoma multiforme. a cancer of the brain. his wife. Rosemary Corbett. said.  His climate work took one of the family’s most prominent charitable organizations in a highly unusual direction for any philanthropy  scrappiness. It was all the more unusual for a great great grandson of John D. Rockefeller. the founder of Standard Oil. to confront Exxon Mobil. a successor company to the Rockefeller oil monopoly. Mr Kaiser’s actions. with the support of his family. upended the generally polite world of philanthropy. the journalist and climate change activist Bill McKibben said in an interview.  It’s hard enough to get anyone to take on powerful interests. but when they’re the powerful interest from which your family derived its wealth. that’s really brave.  Mr McKibben said. adding.  I can’t think of anything like it in history.   John Passacantando. a consultant to philanthropies and a longtime activist on climate change issues. said in an interview that Mr Kaiser’s actions had  done more to change the landscape in the climate fight than anything I have seen in 30 years.  The decision to take on Exxon. he said. was  almost Shakespearean.  John D. Rockefeller’s heirs have long been uncomfortable with Exxon’s legacy and the effects of fossil fuels on the planet. but they have generally addressed those concerns in quiet meetings with company executives and by submitting shareholder proposals calling for environmental action.    Evidence.  it said.  appears to suggest that the company worked since the 1980s to confuse the public about climate change’s march. while simultaneously spending millions to fortify its own infrastructure against climate change’s destructive consequences and track new exploration opportunities as the Arctic’s ice receded.  The evidence cited in the divestment announcement was developed. in part. with Rockefeller money.      Mr Wasserman said in an interview that Mr Kaiser had known that the fight would lead to trouble.  We received all sorts of threats from the company’s allies.  he said. including subpoenas from Congress.  David never flagged.    He added   We have exercised our freedom of association by talking with like minded public interest advocates about how best to educate the public about the realities of climate change. And we have exercised our right to petition the government for redress of grievances by informing elected officials about our concerns that in the course of its climate science campaign. Exxon may have violated the law.     Mr Kaiser graduated from Columbia University in 1991 with a degree in American history. He and Ms. Corbett met in 2011 through the online dating service OkCupid. They discovered a shared interest in criminal justice reform. Ms. Corbett recalled. and Mr Kaiser seemed startlingly open.  I asked what the worst thing he’d ever done in a relationship was  and he told me   she said.  I thought he was being so transparent. but there was a lot he wasn’t telling me.  What he had left out was that he was a Rockefeller. She said that when he did tell her. months later. she wanted to break off the relationship. she was unable to see. she said. how  a person with a working class background and leftist politics could possibly have a successful relationship with someone from a family of such privilege.  They married in 2012. In late 2018. Mr Kaiser began experiencing episodes of forgetfulness. which led to his diagnosis early the next year. Ms. Corbett said that in recent months he had told her   Of course I wish my life were going to be longer. I wish I could see who the girls will turn into.  But. she said. he added.  I’ve also been an extremely lucky person  more lucky than most.  ,crimes

New York’s highest ranking uniformed chief. was one of several officers who were attacked on the Brooklyn Bridge. officials said.  New York City’s top uniformed police officer. two lieutenants and a sergeant were injured on Wednesday in two separate incidents on the Brooklyn Bridge. including one that involved an attack with some kind of stick or pole as protesters marched nearby. officials said.    With a small group gathered on the walkway near the officers as they took the person into custody. someone in a purple shirt ran toward the crowd and swung a long. thin instrument twice at the police. causing at least one of the officers to reach for his head as if he had been struck. according to a 10 second video clip of the episode released by the department. The assailant backed away immediately after striking the officers and was still being sought. Lieutenant Grimpel said. It was not clear whether the person wielding the stick had a connection to the person who was being arrested. the lieutenant said. In a message posted on Twitter along with the video clip. the department said that three officers had been  violently attacked by protesters crossing the Brooklyn Bridge.   This is not peaceful protest.  the message continued.  This will not be tolerated.   The bridge attack left a lieutenant and a sergeant with cuts on their scalps and Chief Monahan with an injured hand. Lieutenant Grimpel said.  We don’t believe it’s broken.  the lieutenant added of the chief’s hand. A second lieutenant sustained a broken eye socket when he was punched in a separate incident. As the top uniformed officer. Chief Monahan is in many ways the public face of the Police Department’s 36.000 rank and file members. He has criticized many of the criminal justice changes being pushed by activists and some elected officials. During the protests. he has been a somewhat contradictory figure  showing solidarity with demonstrators by taking a knee on one occasion and personally overseeing aggressive arrests on another.

https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/is-that-the-culprit-who-knows/,‘Is that the Culprit?’ Who Knows?," But lawyers on the defense side of the aisle did not necessarily greet the reforms with open arms.     Richard A. Brown the Queens district attorney said that in his borough most of the guidelines were already being followed. But it was important to create uniformity Mr Brown said.  In our county I get 78 000 arrest cases a year   he said.  Some of these other counties have only a small number of arrest cases with very few cops so this will go ahead and it will provide for
                    a stable situation statewide.  Mr Garber criticized the language in the guidelines about double blind procedures which reads   A significant benefit of the double blind procedure is its ability to negate the defense contention that the administrator
                    in some unspecified way guided or cued the witness into picking the suspect.  This puts the focus more on hampering defense lawyers than on making sure an identification is correct Mr Garber said. The guidelines which do not specifically  recommend the double blind procedure also say that  the requirement of a ‘blind’ administrator is a significant strain on resources as it increases
                    the personnel requirements for investigating a case.   They’re really telling people who are conducting the lineups ‘If you don’t have the resources don’t kill yourselves trying to do this the best way possible ’   Mr 
                    Garber said. Kate Hogan president of the state’s District Attorneys Association said that double blind lineups were not feasible statewide where some prosecutors offices and police departments are very small. There are
                    10 or fewer prosecutors in 40 district attorneys’ offices throughout the state Ms. Hogan said. The Police Department in Malone N.Y. has only 11 officers.  If only two are working at night are you going to bring in police officers from home   Ms. Hogan asked. She cited another problem with the double blind procedure  When multiple witnesses picked the same person she said the administrator would no longer be  blind.  In that case a different administrator
                    would have to be used for each witness which may not be feasible Ms. Hogan said.  In New York Mr Scheck explained prosecutors may not enter photo identifications on their direct case. This means that when a witness identifies a suspect from a photograph that suspect must then be brought into
                    a live lineup and the witness must again pick the person. The problem is that the witness will feel obligated to stick with the same identification in the live lineup Mr Scheck said. But if the law allowed prosecutors to go on photo identifications alone then they could
                    implement blinding procedures that are much easier to carry out with photos than live lineups Mr Scheck said. For example the investigator handling the case could put each photograph in a separate envelope so
                    even he or she would not know which one the suspect was in when the witnesses pull them out to look.  I’m always in favor of progress but it’s not fast enough   Mr Scheck said referring to the guidelines.   It eliminates the comparison factor   Mr Hellerstein said. During lineups witnesses  assume somebody in there must be the guy   he added.  So they take the guy who looks more like
                    him than the others.  Ms. Hogan of the district attorneys’ association said that the guidelines provided alternatives that are as effective as double blind procedures. They call for written instructions to be provided to witnesses
                    before they view the lineup and for the administrator to stand out of the witness’s line of sight when the witness is picking.  What we’re offering is a very common sense low cost alternative   Ms. Hogan said.  It has the same protection.  Don’t let that fly  The letter cites laws that prohibit gambling and betting on races between animals except when explicitly permitted.  This prohibition includes racing or trials of speed between pigeons conducted for the purpose of betting or where any reward is granted to the winning trainer   the letter reads. Of course part of PETA’s desire to shoot down the races is that it contends they are cruel to the pigeons. No action has been taken as yet against the pigeon racers. Hiring   Comments are no longer being accepted. If double blind studies are the gold standard in statistical studies evaluating a medication’s effectiveness in saving lives then we should demand no less before we sentence people to die.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/world/middleeast/darfur-sudan.html,The Dictator Who Waged War on Darfur Is Gone  but the Killing Goes On, The ouster of Sudan’s longtime ruler last year stoked hopes for peace in brutalized Darfur. But violence has surged amid fresh accusations against Sudan’s security forces.  CAIRO  On camels horses and motorbikes dozens of Arab militiamen stormed into the remote village in Darfur in western Sudan firing wildly witnesses said. Houses were pillaged animals stolen and water tanks smashed. Villagers ran for their lives. United Nations peacekeepers scrambled to the scene but said they found the road blocked by obstacles placed in their way and continued on foot. When they arrived after two and a half hours it was too late. At least nine people lay dead including a 15 year old boy and another 20 were seriously wounded according to the United Nations.  Now Mr al Bashir languishes in jail and Sudan is run by a joint civilian military government that has promised to usher in a new era of democracy and finally  after 17 years of suffering  bring peace to Darfur.  And the Sudanese military has faced accusations of negligence as in Fata Bornu or even being complicit.  They stand silent in front of the janjaweed attacks   said Adam Mohamed a senior leader of Darfur’s displaced community in a telephone interview.  They do nothing.   After Saturday’s massacre in Masteri village in West Darfur state Sudan’s civilian prime minister Abdalla Hamdok promised to send the police and army reinforcements  to protect citizens and the farming season.  But distrust of the security forces runs high in Darfur where the military has an ignominious history of manipulating and frequently directing ethnic violence according to human rights groups.  When you see attacks like this one and it’s just another Tuesday in Darfur you realize that not much has changed since the revolution   said Cameron Hudson a former State department official and Sudan expert at the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center a research group speaking of the attack on Fata Bornu. While Sudan’s dictator has been vanquished his legacy has proved harder to dismantle and the transition to democracy has stalled perilously in key areas.    The war in Darfur erupted in 2003 when Darfuri rebels angered by longstanding discrimination against the region’s non Arab population rose up against the government. Mr al Bashir hit back by arming the janjaweed who killed thousands of civilians monthly at the height of the war in attacks that the International Criminal Court has classified as genocide. The United Nations estimates that at least 300 000 people have died in a conflict that decreased in recent years but never stopped.  Mr Hamdan is now part of a government led effort to negotiate peace with two Darfuri rebel groups. But many Darfuris see the talks as little more than window dressing because the largest rebel group led by a former lawyer Abdul Wahid al Nur has spurned them. The escalating crisis comes just as the international community is shifting attention away from Sudan.  Foreign officials eager to prop up Sudan’s shaky transition to democracy appear to be reluctant to point blame at its fledgling government when trouble erupts in Darfur.   But internal United Nations reports reviewed by The New York Times as well as interviews with Darfuri tribal leaders and United Nations officials paint a different picture. The villagers mostly people displaced by earlier fighting had been protesting for two weeks before the attack. They demanded the resignation of the local governor Maj. Gen. Malik Al Tayeb Khojaly accusing him of siding with the local Arab community. On July 12 General Khojaly responded to the villagers’ demands by withdrawing security from the area villagers told United Nations officials. The Arab militiamen who were at least 100 strong attacked the next morning. The United Nations peacekeepers mostly from Senegal heard gunfire and saw plumes of smoke as they approached the camp. When a contingent of at least 130 peacekeepers finally arrived they found terrified villagers huddled outside a school or hiding in the bushes. It was unclear if Sudanese troops had stood aside to allow the attack to take place but an internal United Nations report pointedly noted their absence.   of the GoS security forces were on the ground to defend the IDPs   it said using shorthand for the Sudanese government and internally displaced people. A spokesman for the Khartoum government did not respond to requests for comment. An official delegation visited Fata Bornu and promised to investigate the attack. Ashraf Eissa a spokesman for the United Nations peacekeepers said the mission was  doing its best  to protect civilians in the parts of Darfur where it still deployed. Since 2018 the mission has closed bases across Darfur and reduced its strength to 6 500 peacekeepers down from 19 500.  This is a mission in exit mode   he said.  Mr al Bashir’s once powerful Islamist party has been dissolved and Mr Hamdok a mild mannered technocrat has introduced a raft of modernizing legal reforms. Female genital cutting has been outlawed. Women can no longer be arrested for wearing clothing deemed insufficiently modest and flogging has been abolished for all lawbreakers. The apostasy laws have been scrapped Christians are allowed to consume alcohol and any citizen can leave Sudan without an exit visa. Gay sex is no longer punishable by the death penalty though it is still subject to a seven year jail sentence. And Mr al Bashir 76 is behind bars. Sentenced to two years imprisonment for corruption in December the deposed autocrat reappeared in court last week to face separate charges over the 1989 military coup that catapulted him to power. If convicted he faces the death penalty. On June 30 frustration with the slow pace of change prompted giant street protests across Sudan the first since last year.  Freedom peace and justice   chanted the crowds echoing a slogan of the anti Bashir movement. One of the protests took place in Fata Bornu. But many other Darfuris abandoning their dreams of change have fled to Libya to try the perilous sea crossing to Europe or have ended up in refugee camps in neighboring Chad.  Civil society leaders in Darfur say it is crucial that some form of peacekeeping mission step in when the United Nations mission leaves Darfur.  We need to protect the lives of the people   said El Sadig Hassan secretary general of the Darfur Bar Association.  Otherwise the crisis will continue.  ,crimes

Six years after a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown a Black teenager in Ferguson Mo. another investigation into the killing has come to the same conclusion as the first  The officer should not be charged.   Can we prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime occurred   Mr Bell the top prosecutor in St. Louis County said at a news conference.  The answer to that is no.   Mr Brown was 18 and a recent high school graduate when he got into a confrontation with Mr Wilson on a quiet residential road. A struggle at Mr Wilson’s police vehicle turned into a street pursuit that ended with Mr Wilson fatally shooting Mr Brown. Witnesses said Mr Brown had his hands up when he was shot  sparking outrage and a protest rallying cry  but federal and local investigators said the evidence suggested otherwise.  Although this case represents one of the most significant moments in St. Louis’s history the question for this office was a simple one  Could we prove beyond a reasonable doubt that when Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown he committed murder or manslaughter under Missouri law   Mr Bell said.  After an independent and in depth review of the evidence we cannot prove that he did.   Jim Towey a lawyer for Mr Wilson said he and Mr Wilson had not known that Mr Bell was formally reviewing the case although they had assumed it was possible because the prosecutor pledged to do so while campaigning for the job.  Everybody that’s looked at the case has come to the same conclusion   Mr Towey said.  There was not a crime and there should be no prosecution.  Even without a criminal prosecution Mr Brown’s death brought attention to police killings of Black people. It also forced many police departments to consider new reforms like making officers wear body cameras and other changes in the criminal justice system like ending cash bail. An investigation by the Justice Department found that law enforcement in Ferguson regularly violated the rights of Black people leading to changes in laws and how courts and cities operate.  But as Mr Bell left the lectern on Thursday a man yelled at him saying he would be voted out and criticizing his decision not to charge Mr Wilson. Mr Brown’s name  among those of other Black people killed by the police  was frequently shouted by protesters or etched onto cardboard signs during weeks of recent protests that rapidly extended across the country after Mr Floyd was killed in May.   ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/nyregion/New-jersey-inmate-release-Covid.html,About 20% of N.J. Prisoners Could Be Freed to Avoid Virus, Believed to be the first Covid 19 bill of its kind the legislation could free more than 3 000 New Jersey prisoners who are within a year of release.  New Jersey lawmakers are expected to approve legislation that could free more than 3 000 prisoners  about 20 percent of the state’s prison population  months before their release dates in response to the extraordinary threat posed by the coronavirus in tightly packed correctional facilities. Inmates who are within a year of completing their state prison sentences would be eligible to be released up to eight months early based on credits awarded for time served during the pandemic. The bill which the American Civil Liberties Union believes to be the first legislative initiative of its kind in the United States would not permit the release of most sex offenders but would apply to inmates sentenced for other violent crimes including murder.  There are people who were sentenced to long prison terms but they weren’t sentenced to die in prison   said Amol Sinha executive director of the A.C.L.U. of New Jersey one of the groups urging passage of the legislation. The Legislature was prepared to take a final vote on the bill on Thursday but it was delayed when several last minute amendments were introduced.     Rory Price Jr. a 39 year old inmate who was serving a three and a half year sentence for drug and weapons convictions was weeks away from being released from a prison halfway house when he developed a deep cough that sapped the color from his face.  He was like gray   said Art Devlin 55 who shared a dormitory room with Mr Price for a year at the house in Bridgeton N.J.  He started with the coughing the hacking. I told them ‘This guy’s sick.’  But Mr Price continued to work in the kitchen sleep in a 12 man dormitory and dream of the party his family was planning when he was freed in May Mr Devlin said. He never got home. Mr Price died May 1 of the coronavirus in a Vineland N.J. hospital 21 days before his release date.  It has been a living nightmare   said his mother Bernice Ferguson 54.  He was doing his time. He did not go there for a death sentence.   If approved the bill could free more than 3 000 inmates  about one fifth of the 16 704 people serving state criminal sentences in New Jersey. The prison population in New Jersey has declined by about 12 percent since the start of the pandemic in March based on a combination of factors including the early releases and the virus related slowdown within the court system.  A final vote is likely in late August. If signed into law by Gov. Philip D. Murphy the release of inmates could begin in mid September according to a sponsor of the bill in the Senate Nellie Pou.  We have to realize that we’re dealing with an emergency here   said Ms. Pou who added that she is confident the bill will be approved in the Assembly and Senate. A spokesman for Mr Murphy would not comment on whether he would sign the bill into law. A spokesman for the state attorney general Gurbir S. Grewal who oversees the State Police and county prosecutors also said he would not comment on pending legislation. Senator Gerald Cardinale a Republican who represents parts of Bergen and Passaic Counties and describes himself as a law and order conservative said his support for the legislation stemmed from  basic simple justice.  He said the state Department of Corrections had failed to keep inmates in its custody safe.  We are not doing very well at all in terms of protecting people   said Mr Cardinale who voted to approve the bill in a Senate committee.  They’re prisoners but they are human beings.   At one point since March there were 800 active cases of Covid 19 in state correctional facilities. Prisons have since successfully slowed the spread. The state has begun its second phase of universal testing and there are now fewer than 30 coronavirus cases linked to state correctional facilities according to the commissioner of the Department of Corrections Marcus O. Hicks. Still employees continue to pose a risk of importing new cases of the virus and social distancing in crowded facilities remains virtually impossible. Updated July 27 2020 Scott Clements said he feared that his brother Brian who has diabetes and heart disease and will be 59 next week may not make it until his February release date. Brian Clements is serving a seven and a half year sentence at South Woods State Prison for his role in a fatal car accident but does not fall into any of the four categories eligible to apply for release under the governor’s April executive order.  If he was to contract the virus it’s going to be as close to a death sentence as anyone could imagine   said Scott Clements 48.  I want to bring my brother home in my Toyota Camry not in a hearse.  Nicole D. Porter the director of advocacy for the Sentencing Project a national nonprofit that advocates for sentencing reform and the elimination of racial disparities in the criminal justice system said that while the proposal is a step it the right direction it is still not enough.  A Republican who voted against the bill in an Assembly committee Christopher P. DePhillips said he was sympathetic to the significant challenges facing prisoners in the middle of a pandemic. But Mr DePhillips said he was concerned about allowing the early release of violent offenders and would have preferred for the Legislature to have had a role in devising ways to keep inmates safe  before being asked to free them. Mr Devlin however said it was impossible to remain apart in the prison housing units where masks were not regularly worn. Officials from the halfway house run by the Kintock Group did not return calls.  I was scared for my life  absolutely scared for my life   said Mr Devlin who completed his sentence in late May but still worries about those left behind.  Now I’m scared for their lives.  ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/juvenile-detainees-coronavirus.html,Virus-Driven Push to Release Juvenile Detainees Leaves Black Youth Behind, After an initial decrease in the youth detention population since the pandemic began the rate of release has slowed and the gap between white youth and Black youth has grown.    Judges and state leaders have taken measures to halt intakes of low level offenders and to send nonviolent and vulnerable detainees home. But the Casey report based on a survey of juvenile justice agencies in 33 states found that many Black children ages 10 to 17 had been left behind. In February before the coronavirus was widespread in the United States the white release rate was about 7 percent higher than the Black release rate the report found by May that gap rose to 17 percent.  It’s clear that the juvenile justice system does not value Black life even during a worldwide public health pandemic   said Liz Ryan the president and chief executive of Youth First Initiative an advocacy group that campaigns against youth incarceration.  Juvenile detention agencies’ inaction during Covid 19 has exacerbated racial disparities and is utterly irresponsible and disgraceful.  Nate Balis the director of the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s Juvenile Justice Strategy Group said the push to release young people from confinement had lost momentum since showing initial results. The organization tracked a significant 27 percent decrease in the youth detention population since the pandemic began and admission rates dropped proportionately by race among Black white and Latino youth. But after a surge of releases in March they tapered off in April and May and Black youth remained overrepresented in detention partly because their release rates had stalled.  In the months since the pandemic emerged in March the disparities in detention that disadvantage Black youth have gotten worse solely because Black youth have been released at a slower rate than their white peers   the report said. The survey did not include explanations for why young people remained detained. Judges and law enforcement officials who opposed calls for juvenile release argued that some low level offense categories did not capture the dangerous nature of the crimes and that many youth were better off in state custody because they risked returning to unstable home lives and unsafe neighborhoods. Proponents of release countered with data showing that juvenile crime had declined 71 percent since 1997 and the number of incarcerated youths had dropped 59 percent.  Based on what the data has been showing us for years there’s no reason to believe that the kids who are there today are there for major offenses   Mr Balis said.  Especially during the pandemic especially in this moment of heightened awareness of racial disparity in this country every system needs to be looking at their data and figuring out what stands in their way.    We’ve seen prosecutors and judges argue that Covid isn’t killing young people in large numbers thereby downplaying the other long term consequences of this devastating disease   said Jennifer L. Egan the chief attorney in the juvenile division for the Maryland Office of the Public Defender in Baltimore which filed an emergency petition that prompted the high court’s order this spring.  We also know that racism leads people to underestimate the pain experienced by Black people   she added. Juvenile justice groups say efforts to release more young people as the virus resurges must focus on the officials who are making decisions about youth releases. Updated July 27 2020    You can’t incarcerate a virus   said Joshua Rovner a senior advocacy associate at the Sentencing Project.  We should be happy that many youth are being released who should have never been there in the first place   he said.  I don’t want to minimize the fact that white youth are benefiting from that but the data speak for itself  All of our kids are not being treated equally.  ,crimes
https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/science/earth/28nox.html,New Culprit Seen in Ozone Depletion,   Government scientists who study the depletion of Earth’s protective ozone layer are pointing to a previously unheralded culprit  nitrous oxide.  Most of the nitrous oxide in the atmosphere emerges naturally through the action of bacteria in the soil the researchers say. But the gas is also produced by human activity through the use of nitrogen based fertilizers the application of livestock manure to fields the burning of biofuels and in other ways. Though nitrous oxide is not regulated under the Montreal Protocol the 1987 agreement to limit emissions of ozone depleting chemicals the researchers say it is emerging as the leading artificial cause of ozone loss.  The researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report their findings in Friday’s issue of the journal Science.  They note that the health of the ozone layer has been improving since the adoption of the protocol and that nitrous oxide looms large today as an artificial destroyer of the ozone layer in part because the emissions of other harmful chemicals have been so sharply reduced. But major chemical targets of the Montreal agreement chlorofluorocarbons inhibit the ozone destroying actions of nitrous oxide the researchers said. So as their levels fall the harmful influence of nitrous oxide increases. The Environmental Protection Agency is already contemplating action on nitrous oxide because it is a heat trapping gas linked to global warming. In April the agency declared it and five other gases including carbon dioxide to be pollutants that endanger public health making them subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. In a statement the agency said Thursday that work on a reporting system for emissions of nitrous oxide and the five gases was under way. John S. Daniel one of the authors of the new report said scientists had for some time known of the ozone depleting potential of nitrous oxide. But Mr Daniel said in a telephone news conference  there is a sort of gap between the scientific understanding and the policy.  The researchers did not make any policy recommendations in light of their finding.  It is not for us to gauge how much risk there is   said A. R. Ravishankara who led the work. In any event he said at the moment researchers could not say with confidence  how much nitrous oxide comes from where.   The uncertainties are significant   Dr. Ravishankara said. Dr. Ravishankara estimated that worldwide the ozone layer had been reduced by about 6 percent from what it was before industrialization.  At ground level ozone is a pollutant but in the upper atmosphere it blocks ultraviolet radiation that would harm plants and animals on Earth’s surface. When researchers discovered that chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons were depleting this high level ozone layer and especially after the discovery of a highly depleted ozone hole over Antarctica international negotiators produced the Montreal agreement. Because of the unusual atmospheric chemistry above Antarctica nitrous oxide does not affect the ozone hole there Dr. Ravishankara said.  ,crimes
