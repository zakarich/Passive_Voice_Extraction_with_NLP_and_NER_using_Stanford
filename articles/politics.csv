https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/style/tiktok-teen-politics-gen-z.html,TikTok Is Shaping Politics. But How? Advertisement Supported by Two researchers have studied political expression on the app since the Musical.ly era. Here’s what they found. None None None The truth is more complicated. A team of researchers has been analyzing political expression on TikTok since  well  before it was TikTok. While nonusers of TikTok may think it’s bursting onto the political stage rather suddenly  and that it has something like a collective political identity  the research gives a different picture. It depicts a diverse  diffuse and not nearly united community of millions of young people discovering the capabilities and limits of a platform that is  despite its many similarities with predecessors  a unique and strange place. In an email exchange  Ioana Literat  an assistant professor of communication and media at Teachers College  Columbia University  and Neta Kligler-Vilenchik  an assistant professor of communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  discussed the characteristics of political expression on TikTok and why it feels like a novel phenomenon. This interview has been edited. The idea that TikTok is an engine for progressive young politics is gaining some currency among people who don’t use the platform. What might outsiders be surprised to find on TikTok  in terms of youth political expression? Is there anything resembling consensus? None On the one hand  youth are hailed (or tokenized — think Greta Thunberg and the Parkland youth) as the future of democracy  for whom political expression comes easy. But on the other hand  people are worried about how they don’t show up at the polls  or fall prey to misinformation  or don’t care about newspapers anymore. And all of these are true  it’s not an either/or kind of situation. None To me  this continuity is quite reassuring  because it shows us that our fears and hopes are not so much around the traits of the specific new technology  rather they are broad societal fears and hopes that are projected onto whatever technology is new and not yet understood. To most of its adult commenters  TikTok is a big unknown. None None It’s hard to refer to what we see on the platform as consensus. Rather  we find that TikTok enables collective political expression for youth — that is  it allows them to deliberately connect to a like-minded audience by using shared symbolic resources. None Are there novel ways in which political conflict unfolds on TikTok? It doesn’t seem to be especially well suited to the sorts of conflict we’re familiar with on some older platforms. None Something that’s pretty special about TikTok in terms of both political expression and political dialogue/conflict is that it’s all filtered through young people’s personal identities and experiences. Political dialogue on the platform is very personal  and youth will often state diverse social identities — e.g. Black  Mexican  L.G.B.T.Q.  redneck  country — in direct relation to their political views. Not to say that political talk on other social media platforms is not personal  but having done comparative analyses  we’re really struck by just how front-and-center youth identities are on TikTok. None So  some users may choose to tag their video with #bluelivesmatter and speak to a certain audience. But they can also choose to tag their video with #blacklivesmatter  and that way reach a different audience  with a different view. Often this is done ironically  as a parody of others’ views (e.g.  a video tagged #whitelivesmatter that goes on to explain the idea of white privilege)  but it may also be a way to spark conversation between sides. Lastly  if you’ve been able to check in  have you noticed anything surprising about youth expression on TikTok around BLM  racism and policing in the last few weeks? None Like hashtags  these songs function as connective threads among the videos. At the same time  there is such a wide variety in terms of style and ethos of expression  from anger to silliness to humor  from confessionals to original songs to footage of protests to memes to interviews or oral histories. There’s also a sense of generational awareness and generational solidarity  which is connected to this concept of collective political expression. On footage of protests  you see a lot of comments like “Gen Z is changing the world ” “our generation is so powerful ” “I love our generation with all my heart” — which is really interesting because generations  and especially terms like Gen Z or Gen Alpha  are how outsiders (academics  commenters  brands  etc.) usually refer to youth. It may be that youth are reclaiming these terms to assert their agency  or perhaps these larger societal discourses are seeping into youth discourse too. None In Israel  protests in solidarity with BLM were infused with the protest of Ethiopian-origin Israelis who suffer from racial discrimination and police brutality. This speaks to how TikTok enables young people to connect a personalized political message to a broader political moment. Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/politics/federal-executions-pandemic.html,Federal Executions to Resume Amid a Pandemic and Protests Advertisement Supported by The administration is pressing ahead with the first federal execution in 17 years as demonstrators seek changes to the criminal justice system and lawyers have trouble visiting death-row clients. None WASHINGTON — Daniel Lewis Lee is scheduled to be executed in less than two weeks  but he has been unable to see his lawyers for three months because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Lee  sentenced to death for his involvement in the 1996 murder of a married couple and their 8-year-old daughter  has been limited to phone calls  which one of his lawyers  Ruth Friedman  said she feared would jeopardize her client’s confidentiality. And amid a pandemic that has put travel on hold  her team has been unable to discuss pressing issues with Mr. Lee  conduct investigations  or interview witnesses in person. “I can’t do my job right. Nobody can ” Ms. Friedman said from her apartment 600 miles away  in Washington  D.C.  where she is working to commute Mr. Lee’s sentence to life in prison. None None None With a justice system barely cranking back to life  lawyers for the federal inmates on death row are struggling to work from home while their clients’ days are numbered. None But Ms. Friedman and the other lawyers are at an impasse: travel to the Terre Haute prison and risk their own health or stay home and risk doing less than they might be able to do otherwise — like conducting investigations or in-person interviews — to spare their client’s life. “Whatever they do is going to be wrong ” said Robert Dunham  executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. He questioned why the Justice Department would prioritize federal executions over the lives of those who might be exposed to the virus in the process. “Nobody has to be executed now ” he said. None In announcing the schedule for this summer’s federal executions  Mr. Barr said the death penalty was the will of the American people as expressed through Congress and presidents of both parties  and that the four men scheduled to die “have received full and fair proceedings under our Constitution and laws.” None None Though Mr. Biden now opposes capital punishment  he played a central role as a senator in the passage of the 1994 crime bill that expanded the use of the federal death penalty. Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked Mr. Biden for his record on criminal justice issues. None But today’s candidates are vying for the White House amid nationwide protests over racism in the criminal justice system. Black people make up 42 percent of those on death row  both among federal inmates and over all  compared to 13 percent of the general population. Though the four inmates scheduled to be executed this summer are white  critics of the death penalty warned that resumption of federal executions would only exacerbate the policy’s discrimination against people of color. “It would be nice if they used those resources to address the widespread problem of police violence against Black people ” said Samuel Spital  director of litigation at the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense & Educational Fund. Mr. Spital also questioned why the Justice Department did not use those resources allocated to resume federal executions to protect prisons from the coronavirus. Imposing the death penalty amid the pandemic holds risks for those carrying out the execution: Doing so may require dozens of individuals  including corrections officers  victims and journalists  to come in close contact. The Bureau of Prisons directed that face masks would be required for all individuals throughout the entire procedure  with violators asked to leave the premises. Social distancing will be practiced “to the extent practical ” but the bureau conceded that limited capacity of the media witness room might preclude their ability to maintain a six-foot distance between observers. “The safety of our staff and the members of the community are of the utmost importance ” the bureau said in a statement. Ms. Friedman is not sure if she will visit her client or attend Mr. Lee’s execution next month. After a 30-year career representing inmates facing their deaths  Ms. Friedman must decide for the first time whether or not to risk her own health or ask her colleagues  some of whom care for older family members  to risk theirs. None In a statement  Mr. Barr maintained that the decision to reinstate federal capital punishment was owed “to the victims of these horrific crimes  and to the families left behind.” But Monica Veillette  who lost her aunt and cousin to Mr. Lee’s crimes  does not believe that this execution is for her family. She has asthma  and both her grandmother and parents are older. If they travel to Indiana for the execution from Washington State and Arkansas  each of them could be put at risk of contracting the virus. “If they owe us anything  it’s to keep us safe now by not pushing this execution through while people are still scrambling to access disinfectant spray and proper masks ” she said. “Haven’t enough people died?” Updated July 5  2020 None Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/us/politics/obama-biden-trump.html,How the Trump Campaign Is Drawing Obama Out of Retirement Advertisement Supported by None Just after Donald J. Trump was elected president  Barack Obama slumped in his chair in the Oval Office and addressed an aide standing near a conspicuously placed bowl of apples  emblem of a healthy-snacking policy soon to be swept aside  along with so much else. “I am so done with all of this ” Mr. Obama said of his job  according to several people familiar with the exchange. Yet he knew  even then  that a conventional White House retirement was not an option. Mr. Obama  55 at the time  was stuck holding a baton he had wanted to pass to Hillary Clinton  and saddled with a successor whose fixation on him  he believed  was rooted in a bizarre personal animus and the politics of racial backlash exemplified by the birther lie. “There is no model for my kind of post-presidency ” he told the aide. “I’m clearly renting space inside the guy’s head.” Which is not to say that Mr. Obama was not committed to his pre-Trump retirement vision — a placid life that was to consist of writing  sun-flecked fairways  policy work through his foundation  producing documentaries with Netflix and family time aplenty at a new $11.7 million spread on Martha’s Vineyard. Still  more than three years after his exit  the 44th president of the United States is back on a political battlefield he longed to leave  drawn into the fight by an enemy  Mr. Trump  who is hellbent on erasing him  and by a friend  Joseph R. Biden Jr.  who is equally intent on embracing him. The stakes of that re-engagement were always going to be high. Mr. Obama is nothing if not protective of his legacy  especially in the face of Mr. Trump’s many attacks. Yet interviews with more than 50 people in the former president’s orbit portray a conflicted combatant  trying to balance deep anger at his successor with an instinct to refrain from a brawl that he fears may dent his popularity and challenge his place in history. That calculus  though  may be changing in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by the police in Minneapolis. As America’s first black president  now its first black ex-president  Mr. Obama sees the current social and racial awakening as an opportunity to elevate a 2020 election dictated by Mr. Trump’s mud-wrestling style into something more meaningful — to channel a new  youthful movement toward a political aim  as he did in 2008. He is doing so very carefully  characteristically intent on keeping his cool  his reputation  his political capital and his dreams of a cosseted retirement intact. “I don’t think he is hesitant. I think he is strategic ” said Dan Pfeiffer  a top adviser for over a decade. “He has always been strategic about using his voice  it’s his most valuable commodity.” Mr. Obama is also mindful of a cautionary example: Bill Clinton’s attacks against him in 2008 backfired so badly that his wife’s campaign staff had to scale back his appearances. Many supporters have been pressing him to be more aggressive. None The counterargument: He did his job and deserves to be left alone. None None On Thursday  during an invitation-only Zoom fund-raiser  Mr. Obama expressed outrage at the president’s use of “kung flu” and “China virus” to describe the coronavirus. “I don’t want a country in which the president of the United States is actively trying to promote anti-Asian sentiment and thinks it’s funny. I don’t want that. That still shocks and pisses me off ” Mr. Obama said  according to a transcript of his remarks provided by a participant in the event. Mr. Obama speaks with the former vice president and top campaign aides frequently  offering suggestions on staffing and messaging. Last month  he bluntly counseled Mr. Biden to keep his speeches brief  interviews crisp and slash the length of his tweets  the better to make the campaign a referendum on Mr. Trump and the economy  according to Democratic officials. He has taken a particular interest in Mr. Biden’s work-in-progress digital operation  the officials said  enlisting powerful friends  like the LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt  to share their expertise  they said. Yet he continues to slow-walk some requests  especially to headline more fund-raisers. Some in Mr. Obama’s camp suggest he wants to avoid overshadowing the candidate — which Mr. Biden’s people aren’t buying. “By all means  overshadow us ” one of them joked. None But norms are not Mr. Trump’s thing. He made it clear from the start that he wanted to eradicate any trace of Mr. Obama’s presence from the West Wing. “He had the worst taste ” Mr. Trump told a visitor in early 2017  showing off his new curtains — which were not terribly different from Mr. Obama’s  in the view of other people who tramped in and out of the office during that chaotic period. The cancellation was more pronounced when it came to policy. One former White House official recalled Mr. Trump interrupting an early presentation to make sure one staff proposal was not “an Obama thing.” During the transition  in what looks in hindsight like a preview of the presidency  one Trump aide got the idea of printing out the detailed checklist of Mr. Obama’s campaign promises from the official White House website to repurpose as a kind of hit list  according to two people familiar with the effort. “This is personal for Trump  it is all about President Obama and demolishing his legacy. It’s his obsession ” said Omarosa Manigault Newman  an “Apprentice” veteran and  until her abrupt departure  one of the few black officials in Mr. Trump’s West Wing. “President Obama will not be able to rest as long as Trump is breathing.” When the two men met for a stilted postelection sit-down in November 2016  the president-elect was polite  so Mr. Obama took the opportunity to advise him against going scorched-earth on Obamacare. “Look  you can take my name off of it  I don’t care ” he said  according to aides. Mr. Trump nodded noncommittally. As the transition dragged on  Mr. Obama became increasingly uneasy at what he saw as the breezy indifference of the new president and his inexperienced team. Many of them ignored the briefing binders his staff had painstakingly produced at his direction  former Obama aides recalled  and instead of focusing on policy or the workings of the West Wing  they inquired about the quality of tacos in the basement mess or where to find a good apartment. As for Mr. Trump  he had “no idea what he’s doing ” Mr. Obama told an aide after their Oval Office encounter. Jared Kushner  Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser  made an equally indelible impression. During a tour of the building he abruptly inquired  “So how many of these people are sticking around?” The answer was none  his escort replied. (West Wing officials serve at the president’s pleasure  as Mr. Trump would amply illustrate in the coming months.) When the Kushner story was relayed to Mr. Obama  aides recalled  he laughed and repeated it to friends  and even a few journalists  to illustrate what the country was up against. A White House spokesman did not deny the account  but suggested Mr. Kushner might have been talking about security and maintenance personnel rather than political appointees. During other conversations with editors he respected  including David Remnick of The New Yorker and Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic  Mr. Obama was more ruminative  according to people familiar with the interactions. At times  he would float some version of this question: Was there anything he could have done to blunt the Trump backlash? Mr. Obama eventually came to the conclusion that it was a historic inevitability  and told people around him the best he could do was “set a counterexample.” Others thought he needed to do more. During the transition  Paulette Aniskoff  a veteran West Wing aide  began assembling a political organization of former advisers to help Mr. Obama defend his legacy  aid other Democrats and plan for his deployment as a surrogate in the 2018 midterms. He was open to the effort  but his eye was on the exits. “I’ll do what you want me to do ” he told Ms. Aniskoff’s team  but mandated they carefully screen out any appearances that would waste time or squander political capital. Mr. Obama was  then as now  so determined to avoid uttering the new president’s name that one aide jokingly suggested they refer to him as “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named” — Harry Potter’s archenemy  Lord Voldemort. Mr. Trump had no trouble naming names. In March 2017  he falsely accused Mr. Obama of personally ordering the surveillance of his campaign headquarters  tweeting  “How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!” It was an inflection point of sorts. Mr. Obama told Ms. Aniskoff’s team he would call out his successor by name in the 2018 midterms. But not a lot. It was telling how Mr. Obama talked about Mr. Trump that fall: He referred to him less as a person than as a kind of epidemiological affliction on the body politic  spread by his Republican enablers. “It did not start with Donald Trump — he is a symptom  not the cause ” he said in his kickoff speech at the University of Illinois in September 2018. The American political system  he added  was not “healthy” enough to form the “antibodies” to fight the contagion of “racial nationalism.” The pandemic has  if anything  made him more partial to the comparison. The virus  he said during his appearance with Mr. Biden last week  “is a metaphor” for so much else. Mr. Obama felt one of the best ways to safeguard his legacy was by writing his book  which he envisioned as both a detailed chronicle of his presidency and as a serious literary follow-up to his widely praised 1995 memoir  “Dreams From My Father.” In late 2016  Mr. Obama’s agent  Bob Barnett  began negotiating a package deal for Mr. Obama’s memoir and Michelle Obama’s autobiography. Random House eventually won the bidding war with a record-shattering $65 million offer. The process has been a gilded grind. One former White House official who checked in with Mr. Obama in mid-2018 was told the project “was like doing homework.” Another associate  who ran into the former president at an event last year  remarked at how fit he looked. Mr. Obama replied  “Let’s just say my golf game is going a lot better than my book.” It was not especially easy for the former president to look on as his wife’s book  “Becoming ” was published in 2018 and quickly became an international blockbuster. “She had a ghostwriter ” Mr. Obama told a friend who asked about his wife’s speedy work. “I am writing every word myself  and that’s why it’s taking longer.” The book’s timing remains among the touchiest of topics. Mr. Obama  a deliberate writer prone to procrastination — and lengthy digression — insisted that there be no set deadline  according to several people familiar with the process. In an interview shortly after Mr. Obama left office  one of his closest advisers had predicted that the book would be out in mid-2019  before the primary season began in earnest  an option preferred by many working on the project. But Mr. Obama did not finish and circulate a draft of between 600 and 800 pages until around New Year’s  too late to publish before the election  according to people familiar with the situation. He is now seriously considering splitting the project into two volumes  in the hope of getting some of it into print quickly after the election  perhaps in time for the Christmas season  several people close to the process said. Mr. Obama’s other big creative enterprise  a multimillion-dollar 2018 contract with Netflix to produce documentaries and scripted features with his wife  has been a tonic  and quick work by comparison. None One of the first efforts was “Crip Camp ” an award-winning documentary about a summer camp in upstate New York  founded in the early 1970s  that became a focal point of the disability rights movement. Mr. Obama saw the project as a vehicle for his vision of grass-roots political change  and provided feedback during the 18 months the movie was in production. “We saw footage that the filmmakers had just begun to cut together and sent it to the president to look at ” said Priya Swaminathan  co-head of Higher Ground. “He wanted to know how we could help the filmmakers make this the best telling of the story and they were into the collaboration. We watched many  many cuts together.” Part of what Mr. Obama finds so appealing about filmmaking is that it allows him to control the narrative. In that respect  the 2020 campaign has been a disorienting experience: His political career is supposed to be over  yet he has a semi-starring role in a production he has not written or directed. Nowhere has that low-grade frustration been more apparent than in his complicated relationship with Mr. Biden  who is concurrently covetous of his support and fiercely determined to win on his own. Mr. Obama was supportive of Mr. Biden  personally  from the start of the campaign  but he promised Senator Bernie Sanders  in one of their early chats  that his public profession of neutrality was genuine and that he was not working secretly to elect his friend  according to a party official familiar with the exchange. None When a Democratic donor raised the issue of Mr. Biden’s age late last year — he is 77 — Mr. Obama acknowledged those concerns  saying  “I wasn’t even 50 when I got elected  and that job took every ounce of energy I had ” according to the person. None He has never seen Mr. Biden’s campaign as a proxy war between himself and Mr. Trump  his aides insist. But he is  nonetheless  tickled by the lopsided metrics of their competition of late. Mr. Obama monitors their respective polling numbers closely — he gets privately circulated data from the Democratic National Committee — and takes pride in the fact that he has millions more Twitter followers than a president who relies on the platform far more than he does  people close to him said. The former president devours online news  scouring The New York Times  The Washington Post and Atlantic sites on his iPad constantly  and keeps to his White House night-owl hours  sending texts and story links to friends between midnight and 2 a.m. Even during the pandemic he does not sleep late  at least on weekdays  and is often on his Peloton bike by 8 a.m.  sending off a new round of texts  often about the latest Trump outrage. None Yet the rising cries for racial justice have lent the 2020 campaign a coherence for Mr. Obama  a politician most comfortable cloaking his criticism of an opponent — be it Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump — in the language of movement politics. Mr. Obama’s first reaction to the protests  people close to him said  was anxiety — that the spasms of rioting would spin out of control and play into Mr. Trump’s narrative of a lawless left. But peaceful demonstrators took control  igniting a national movement that challenged Mr. Trump without making him its focal point. Soon after  in the middle of a strategy call with political aides and policy experts at his foundation  an excited Mr. Obama pronounced that “a tailor-made moment” had arrived. Mr. Obama has lately been in close contact with his first attorney general  Eric H. Holder Jr.  sharing his outrage over the way the current attorney general  William P. Barr  personally inspected the phalanx of federal law enforcement officers who tear-gassed demonstrators to clear the path for Mr. Trump’s walk to a photo op at a historic church near the White House. Mr. Holder has few qualms about calling Mr. Trump a racist in the former president’s presence. Mr. Obama has never contradicted him  but he avoids the term  even in private  preferring a more indirect accusation of “racial demagoguery ” according to several people close to both men. None In that sense  the role he is most comfortable occupying is the job he was once so over. None “I want you to have hope. I want you to know you are not alone. I want you to know that Michelle and I will do anything you want me to do ” Mr. Obama said during the emotional 25-minute conversation  according to the Rev. Al Sharpton  who was on the call. Two other people with knowledge of the call confirmed its contents. “That was the first time  I think  that the Floyd family really experienced solace since he died ” Mr. Sharpton said in an interview.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/us/politics/biden-guantanamo-prison.html,Biden Still Wants to Close Guantánamo Prison Advertisement Supported by The Obama administration ran into a wall of political opposition when it tried. The former vice president rarely brings up the topic and has yet to draw up a strategy but says he shares the goal. None This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. None In response to a question  his campaign said in a statement that Mr. Biden “continues to support closing the detention center.” Echoing Mr. Obama  the statement said the prison “undermines American national security by fueling terrorist recruitment and is at odds with our values as a country.” But Mr. Biden rarely  if ever  brings up the topic  evidence of how politically toxic it remains after intense Republican efforts to cast Mr. Obama’s initiative as endangering Americans by transferring terrorists to U.S. soil or sending them without adequate safeguards to other countries. When asked about Guantánamo Bay in a primary debate in December  Mr. Biden  who was Mr. Obama’s vice president  blamed Congress for thwarting closure  but rather than suggest a path forward  he pivoted to another issue. The Biden campaign’s foreign policy and national security advisers include veterans of the failed effort by the Obama administration to close it — notably Tony Blinken  a former deputy secretary of state  and Brian P. McKeon  a former Pentagon policy official — who are almost certainly acutely aware of how painful it was to try to make good on Mr. Obama’s promise. If there is any lesson from the previous administration’s inability to overcome opposition to closing Guantánamo  it may be to avoid drawing attention to the effort. Once the Obama administration made clear that closing the detention center meant moving some of the prisoners — notably former C.I.A. prisoners  including five men accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks — to detention facilities in the United States  critics cast the plan as a symbol of weakness and the proposed relocation of the prisoners a potential national security threat. Like tampering with Social Security or suggesting locations for storing nuclear waste  closing Guantánamo became a third rail of political discourse. Roy Neel  who worked for the Clinton administration and several Democratic campaigns  said one legacy of Mr. Obama’s failure was the danger of making promises. “You’re not going to gain any votes because not many people are focusing on this issue  at least rank-and-file voters ” he said  noting that “Obama was burned.” “It doesn’t do anything politically to get into it ” he added. “The worst thing that could happen is Biden is drawn out somehow to look indecisive or weak by going down that rabbit hole.” None Their agenda urged renewed efforts at diplomatic engagement with Iran and Korea as well as repealing the 2001 authorization of the use of military force  a legal basis for holding detainees at Guantánamo  before mentioning closure itself. The question of keeping  closing or expanding Guantánamo is indeed tied up in the intractability of the invasion of Afghanistan  America’s longest war  and the endless nature of the war on terrorism. None None None Mr. Trump  who wants U.S. troops withdrawn from Afghanistan  promised during the 2016 campaign to expand the Guantánamo prison  “to load it up with some bad dudes.” He has not done so. Islamic State prisoners held by proxy militias in northeast Syria and Iraq were  for a time  the most likely candidates for transfer there. But legal experts have warned that such a move would invite court challenges to test whether the 2001 authorization to wage war on Al Qaeda and the Taliban is expansive enough to include the Islamic State  the global movement that emerged out of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. Mr. Trump has faced internal opposition to sending more prisoners to the U.S. military base on a sliver of American-controlled land in Cuba. John R. Bolton  Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser  wrote in his recently published memoir that at one point the president proposed to bring some Islamic State prisoners to Guantánamo from northeast Syria  an idea that was dropped when the defense secretary at the time  Jim Mattis  objected.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/business/jay-clayton-sdny-sec.html,Jay Clayton  Low-Profile Regulator  Is Catapulted Into a Political Fight Advertisement Supported by Amid a muted tenure at the S.E.C.  the corporate lawyer is now the Trump administration’s intended nominee to be the top prosecutor for the Southern District of New York. None After three years at the helm of the Securities and Exchange Commission  Jay Clayton had made it known to colleagues  friends and the Trump administration that he was itching to go back to New York. The longtime and highly-paid corporate lawyer  who had spent his career at Sullivan & Cromwell representing some of the world’s biggest financial institutions  including Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank  wanted to be closer to his family. In a private discussion with Attorney General William P. Barr  Mr. Clayton  53  expressed interest in becoming the top prosecutor for the Southern District of New York  according to a Justice Department official. After a lifetime of practicing securities law and prepping companies for initial public offerings  Mr. Clayton told friends he saw the job as a way to establish his litigation credentials  according to people who know him. Mr. Barr did not object — the two lawyers have known each other for years — and Mr. Clayton has a good relationship with President Trump. The two played golf together last Saturday at the president’s club in Bedminster  N.J.  according to people familiar with the matter  and he has golfed with the president several times in the past. In recent days  talks about Mr. Clayton succeeding Geoffrey S. Berman  the current United States attorney for the Southern District of New York  picked up  according to a person briefed on the matter. None On Saturday afternoon  Mr. Barr told Mr. Berman in a letter that Mr. Trump had fired him and that he had named the deputy U.S. attorney  Audrey Strauss  as acting head. Even before the firing  Republicans suggested that confirming Mr. Clayton would not be easy. Democrats called on him to withdraw his name or face reputational ruin. Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina and a close Trump ally  indicated that he would allow New York’s two Democratic senators  Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand  to block Mr. Clayton’s nomination through a procedural maneuver known as a blue slip. None “Jay Clayton can allow himself to be used in the brazen Trump-Barr scheme to interfere in investigations by the U.S. Attorney for SDNY  or he can stand up to this corruption  withdraw his name from consideration  and save his own reputation from overnight ruin ” Mr. Schumer said on Twitter. None While Mr. Clayton has golfed with Mr. Trump  he is not viewed as a political acolyte or someone who courts controversy in the way the president seems to relish. He did not contribute to the president’s 2016 campaign but has given money to candidates of both parties over the years. Mr. Clayton is not a registered Republican or Democrat. His tenure at the S.E.C. has been fairly muted and Mr. Clayton has not played a high-profile role within the administration. But public scrutiny of Mr. Clayton is likely to increase with his nomination  particularly if he intends to see it through. Mr. Clayton “will surely find himself under considerable pressure from his professional circle not to become a pawn in what will likely be a serious fight ” said Daniel C. Richman  a former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law School professor. Rebecca Roiphe  a New York Law School professor of ethics  put it more simply: “I think he should withdraw his name ” she said. “The process has become politicized and the public would have little faith in him at this point  especially because he doesn’t have the traditional experience and profile of most people who have had the job in the past.” Mr. Clayton has said little since the Friday night uproar. The only statement he has made was an email he sent  just after midnight on early Saturday  to all S.E.C. employees in which he said “pending confirmation  I will remain fully committed to the work of the Commission and the supportive community we have built ” according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times. Just a day earlier  Mr. Clayton had emailed his staff to say that  while they were continuing to work remotely for the summer months  he looked forward to seeing them again in person  offering no indication that he was planning to leave the agency  according to a person briefed on the email. None Before being named S.E.C. chair  Mr. Clayton was a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell  where he did work for banks  hedge funds and big corporations such as Goldman Sachs  Barclays and Alibaba. Within the firm he had a reputation as being a well-placed but cautious person not known for his political views. His pick was seen as evidence that the Trump administration wanted someone in the position with strong ties to corporate America who might be inclined to take a lighter touch to enforcing securities laws and punishing corporate wrongdoers. None None In joining the S.E.C.  he took with him another Sullivan & Cromwell partner  Steven Peikin  a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan and longtime defense lawyer. Mr. Peikin was an assistant prosecutor in Manhattan during the time that James B. Comey  the former director of the F.B.I. who was fired by Mr. Trump  served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District. The S.E.C. under Mr. Clayton has been aggressive in cracking down on fraudulent offerings of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. None Mr. Clayton’s focus on mom-and-pop investors was seen just a few days ago when the S.E.C. raised serious questions about a plan by Hertz to raise up to $500 million in cash by selling stock to investors amid its bankruptcy case. In a bankruptcy proceeding  shares of a company are often wiped out and worthless so the stock offering raised considerable eyebrows on Wall Street. None But the commission’s actions sometimes appeared at odds with Mr. Clayton’s stated focus on ordinary investors. None None None None In that case  the S.E.C. moved far faster than it usually does — filing a civil fraud action against Mr. Musk just weeks after his post set off a firestorm. But some critics felt the settlement that regulators struck with Mr. Musk did not go far enough to punish the voluble entrepreneur. Updated July 5  2020 None Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/politics/justice-department-politicization.html,Justice Dept. Officials Outline Claims of Politicization Under Barr Advertisement Supported by Two career officials accused the attorney general and other political appointees of interfering in law enforcement to advance his interests and the president’s. transcript “Mr. Barr’s actions made clear that in his Department of Justice  the president’s allies get special treatment. The president’s enemies  real and imagined  are targeted for extra scrutiny  and the needs of the American people and the needs of justice are generally ignored. Mr. Barr’s practice of using the department to shield the president and his allies goes back to the beginning of his tenure at the D.O.J. The sickness that we must address is Mr. Barr’s use of the Department of Justice as a weapon to serve the president’s petty private interests. The cancer that we must root out is his decision to place the president’s interests above the interests of the American people.” “The politics was in the previous administration. Bill Barr is doing the Lord’s work trying to clean it up so that it doesn’t happen again. And we have said this before  and I’ll say it in closing. Emmet Flood’s statement a little over a year ago  where he said this: We would all do well to remember if they can do it to a president  they can lie to a FISA court to get a warrant to to go after a president to go after a major party’s political campaign. If they can do it to a president  imagine what they can do to you or I  imagine what they can do to the folks we get the privilege of representing back home. That’s why this is important. That’s why the work Bill Barr is doing is important. You guys can continue to play your political games. Bill Barr is going to get to the truth.” “— And to an ever greater and quite shocking extent this spring  Barr has used the great powers of the Department of Justice to advance the president’s narrow political interests and gravely undermine constitutional rights and the functioning of our democracy. Consider his apparent role in overseeing law enforcement action on June 1 to deny the right of peaceful protest in Lafayette Park.” “The department needs capable  experienced and even-handed leadership. Its components and programs have reach across the country and across the world. It handles matters as diverse as antitrust and anti-terrorism. It takes an experienced lawyer and leader to manage such a department effectively  and I believe  without reservation  that William Barr is that kind of a leader and that this country is fortunate that he leads one of the most important government departments. In a highly publicized and politically fraught case  it was not only proper  but also advisable for the attorney general to assure that the government-sentencing recommendations not promote that unworthy end. The decision to lower the recommendation was reached by others in the department as well —” “What I saw was that Roger Stone was being treated differently from every other defendant. He received breaks that are  in my experience  unheard of. And all the more so for a defendant in his circumstances. And what I heard  repeatedly  was that this leniency was happening because of Stone’s relationship to the president — that the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia was receiving heavy pressure from the highest levels of the Department of Justice and that his instructions to us were based on political considerations. And I was told that the acting U.S. attorney was giving Stone a break because he was afraid the president of the United States.” None Two Justice Department officials recounted to Congress in stinging detail on Wednesday how political appointees had intervened in criminal and antitrust cases to advance the personal interests of President Trump and Attorney General William P. Barr. None “In the United States of America  we do not prosecute people based on politics  and we don’t cut them a break based on politics ” said Mr. Zelinsky  who testified by video because of the coronavirus pandemic. “But that wasn’t what happened here. Roger Stone was treated differently because of politics.” John W. Elias  a senior career official in the antitrust division  charged that his supervisors improperly used their powers to investigate the marijuana industry and a deal between California and four major automakers at the behest of Mr. Barr. He likened their efforts to burdensome harassment meant to punish companies for decisions the attorney general and the president opposed. “Personal dislike of the industry is not a valid basis upon which to ground an antitrust investigation ” Mr. Elias said of the cannabis cases. The two accounts painted a damning portrait of the Justice Department under Mr. Barr  made all the more remarkable given that the witnesses were both still department employees. They could increase pressure on Mr. Barr to further explain decisions related to criminal cases involving Mr. Trump’s associates and the abrupt firing of the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan  who had overseen some of the investigations into Trump allies. Not long after the hearing got underway  the Justice Department announced that Mr. Barr had agreed to appear himself before the panel on July 28. Democrats had been threatening to issue a subpoena for his appearance. Seeking to further increase pressure on the attorney general  Representative Jerrold Nadler  Democrat of New York and the panel’s chairman  told reporters after the hearing that the committee “may very well” pursue impeachment proceedings against Mr. Barr — a highly unlikely outcome given the political reality of a fast-approaching election. During the hearing  lawmakers spent more time trying to argue divergent political points about Mr. Barr  Mr. Trump and the investigations that have hung over his presidency than they did eliciting facts about the Justice Department from either witness. “These are merely the symptoms of an underlying disease ” Mr. Nadler said in opening remarks. “The sickness that we must address is Mr. Barr’s use of the Department of Justice as a weapon to serve the president’s petty  private interests.” Democrats turned frequently to a third witness  Donald B. Ayer  who was deputy attorney general under President George Bush and warned that under Mr. Barr  the country was “on the way to something far worse than Watergate.” Republicans mounted an aggressive defense of Mr. Barr  relying on their witness  Michael B. Mukasey  who was attorney general under President George W. Bush  to try to deflate Democrats’ arguments. “The politics was in the previous administration ” said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio  the top committee Republican. “Bill Barr is doing the Lord’s work trying to clean it up so that it doesn’t happen again.” Republicans worked with the Justice Department to undermine the credibility of Mr. Zelinsky and Mr. Elias  who they pointed out had previously sought an assignment working with Democrats on the committee. A department spokeswoman  Kerri Kupec  said in a statement that Mr. Barr determined that the sentencing recommendation for Mr. Stone was “excessive and inconsistent with similar cases.” She said Mr. Barr did not discuss intervening in the case with the president or anyone at the White House. And she added that Mr. Zelinsky’s testimony was “based on his own interpretation of events and hearsay (at best)  not firsthand knowledge.” None Mr. Stone had been convicted of committing seven felonies to impede a congressional inquiry that threatened Mr. Trump. Mr. Zelinsky described a fraught battle between the career prosecutors working the case and their superiors that spilled into public the day after prosecutors made their request  when Mr. Trump attacked it on Twitter as unjust. Later that day  the department submitted a new  more lenient recommendation to the judge deciding what punishment to impose. Mr. Zelinsky testified that supervisors had openly discussed the intervention to shorten the recommendation as motivated by “political reasons” even though one supervisor agreed that doing so “was unethical and wrong.” He said they also pressured him to mischaracterize trial testimony and play down Mr. Stone’s misconduct so the department could recommend a lighter sentence. Days before the intervention  Mr. Barr had maneuvered the Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia  Jessie K. Liu  out of her role and temporarily installed in her place a close aide from his own office  Timothy Shea. Mr. Zelinsky said that he was told that Mr. Shea “was receiving heavy pressure from the highest levels of the Department of Justice” and complied because he was “afraid of” Mr. Trump. At one point  he said  a supervisor instructed him and other line prosecutors that they could be fired if they did not comply. None Mr. Stone was ultimately sentenced to 40 months in prison and ordered to begin serving is sentence by June 30. He has asked a judge to grant him a two-month reprieve because of the pandemic  and on Wednesday the judge ordered Justice Department officials to report to her on its policies for dealing with such requests. Mr. Elias’s account of the antitrust division more directly tied what he viewed as improper actions by Mr. Barr. “At the direction of Attorney General Barr  the antitrust division launched 10 full-scale reviews of merger activity taking place in the marijuana  or cannabis  industry” because the attorney general “did not like the nature of their underlying business ” Mr. Elias said in written testimony. Mr. Elias also said that the department initiated a review of four major automakers the day after Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he was enraged by the news that the companies would adhere to higher fuel emissions standards than the federal government demands. Under questioning by Representative David Cicilline  Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the panel’s antitrust subcommittee  Mr. Elias said he was “not aware” of any evidence at the time that the investigation would have served the public  and that it was clear throughout that the automakers “had clear legal defenses for what they were doing.” In Mr. Elias’s account  the marijuana industry reviews consumed the antitrust division  making up nearly a third of all of its cases in the fiscal year that ended in September. He said that staff members objected to the numerous requests for information that the department sent to the companies  in large part because they were seen as harassing and overly burdensome. Mr. Elias  who served as chief of staff to Makan Delrahim  the head of the antitrust division  said that during a meeting in September  Mr. Delrahim “acknowledged at an all-staff meeting that the cannabis industry is unpopular ‘on the fifth floor ’ a reference to Attorney General Barr’s offices.” The department’s Office of Professional Responsibility investigated Mr. Elias’s concerns about the reviews of mergers in the cannabis industry and determined that the division “acted reasonably and appropriately ” according to an email sent to the division and obtained by The New York Times. The office also found that given the “unique challenge” that the nascent cannabis industry posed for federal and state regulators  the department reasonably sought out additional information from the industry. None Mr. Barr had ordered that case dropped last month even though Mr. Flynn had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about phone calls with the Russian ambassador — another move that critics of Mr. Barr have portrayed as favoritism to a presidential ally.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/us/politics/trump-statues-american-heroes.html,"Trump Says He Will Create a Statuary Park Honoring ‘American Heroes’ Advertisement Supported by The executive order includes John Adams  Harriet Tubman and Martin Luther King Jr. among those who would be honored. So would Billy Graham  Antonin Scalia and Ronald Reagan. None President Trump ordered the federal government late Friday to design and construct a statuary park honoring “American heroes ” his latest embrace of American heritage in opposition to what he has described as a revolutionary leftist movement that would “erase our values.” None Mr. Trump directed the creation of a task force  chaired by the secretary of the interior  to “expeditiously” open a “National Garden of American Heroes” at a site to be determined. His order specifies 31 Americans whom the garden must memorialize  a group of mostly white men that includes former presidents  pioneers and explorers  abolitionists and civil rights heroes. Mr. Trump’s list of those to be memorialized also singled out two recently deceased conservative icons: former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and the evangelist Billy Graham  as well as former President Ronald Reagan. The lineup includes no equivalent contemporary liberals or Democrats. It does include the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.  Harriet Tubman and Jackie Robinson  the first African-American player in modern major league baseball. The list also includes John Adams  Susan B. Anthony  Daniel Boone  Davy Crockett  Frederick Douglass  Amelia Earhart  Alexander Hamilton  Abraham Lincoln  Douglas MacArthur  Christa McAuliffe  George S. Patton  Jr.  Betsy Ross  Booker T. Washington  George Washington  and the Wright brothers. None “Presidents certainly have a role in shaping national conversations about the meaning of our history. But this comes off as a desperate act of political grandstanding to his base "" said Kevin K. Gaines  a professor of social justice and civil rights at the University of Virginia. “Washington D.C. is already full of national monuments to some of the revered figures on Trump’s roll call of heroes.” Julian E. Zelizer  a professor of political history at Princeton University  agreed that Mr. Trump’s order appeared highly political. “I can’t imagine this would not be used as a way not to honor American history but to put forth a very particular version of American history ” he said. The order says the task force will consist of several federal officials  including the administrator of the General Services Administration and the chairpersons of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. It directs the task force to submit a report within 60 days with proposed locations and other options for creating the site. The order indicates that the future garden would feature more Americans than the ones Mr. Trump specifically named  offering mostly conventional categories for inclusion such as military heroes  entrepreneurs  astronauts  recipients of the Medal of Honor or Presidential Medal of Freedom  religious and labor leaders  “advocates for the poor and disadvantaged ” and “authors  intellectuals  artists  and teachers.” The order also identifies as “historically significant” Americans “opponents of national socialism or international socialism” as well as “police officers and firefighters killed or injured in the line of duty.” “ “None will have lived perfect lives  but all will be worth honoring  remembering  and studying ” Mr. Trump’s order says. Mr. Trump issued his order after speaking at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial  where he warned that he would be “deploying federal law enforcement” to protect national monuments and prosecute protesters who seek to deface or topple them. Since the start of mass protests over the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis  protesters have toppled several statues to confederate generals and leaders  but in some instances have also spray painted or otherwise vandalized monuments to national icons like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Mr. Trump angrily denounced such actions on Friday night  issuing a broader defense of American heritage against what he called “angry mobs” directed by radical leftists “trying to tear down statues of our Founders  deface our most sacred memorials  and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities.” “Their goal is not a better America  their goal is to end America ” Mr. Trump said. His executive order added that “America owes its present greatness to its past sacrifices. Because the past is always at risk of being forgotten  monuments will always be needed to honor those who came before.” Mr. Gaines said the order “proposes a redundant trial balloon with just enough examples of notable African-Americans and women to promote a mythic  racist authoritarian view of the past that glorifies white settler violence. “What most people of conscience would acknowledge as tragic aspects of the past — the stolen lands of Indian nations and the stolen lives and labor of enslaved Africans — Trump evidently wants us to celebrate ” he added.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/nyregion/Jeff-van-drew-primary.html,A Kennedy and a Professor Compete to Run Against a Trump Backer Advertisement Supported by Stakes are high in the Democratic primary for a New Jersey congressional seat: The winner will face a candidate who defected from the party to support Trump. None Jeff Van Drew’s defection from the Democratic Party began with a vote against impeaching President Trump and ended with a handshake in the Oval Office. None None None But Tuesday’s primary race among Democrats vying to run against Mr. Van Drew has split largely along the political fault lines that have divided the party in New Jersey. On one side is Gov. Philip D. Murphy  who offered a late endorsement to the candidate with a celebrity surname: Amy Kennedy  a mental health advocate and former history teacher married to Patrick J. Kennedy  a former congressman and a son of Senator Edward M. Kennedy. On the other are two of Mr. Murphy’s political rivals  George E. Norcross III  a South Jersey power broker  and Stephen M. Sweeney  the Senate president  who are supporting Brigid Callahan Harrison  a professor of political science and law. That lineup was the only predictable element in the race. Both of New Jersey’s United States senators are backing Dr. Harrison  staking ground opposite Mr. Murphy  an ally and fellow Democrat  as are many labor organizations. None With help from Mr. Norcross  Dr. Harrison notched the support of six of the district’s eight county chairs  but Ms. Kennedy won the coveted Democratic Party line in Atlantic County  where more than one third of the district’s voters live. The coronavirus has upended the contest since it has precluded most traditional campaigning. None None None None None Farther north  Representative Josh Gottheimer is facing a progressive challenger  Arati Kreibich  as is Representative Albio Sires. “I really think that people are just looking around and asking: ‘Why is everything so screwed up?’” said Hector Oseguera  a 32-year-old lawyer running in the Democratic primary against Mr. Sires  who has been in Congress since 2006. “And they start to say maybe the people who have been in charge for so long haven’t been doing such a good job.” A third candidate in the running to oppose Mr. Van Drew — Will Cunningham  34  a lawyer and former investigator for the House Committee on Oversight and Reform — makes a similar argument. “Those closest to the pain should be closest to the power ” said Mr. Cunningham  a Black man who experienced homelessness as a child. None Senator Cory Booker  who is running for re-election  filmed a TV ad for Dr. Harrison and is bracketing himself with her on the ballot. Ms. Kennedy was endorsed last week by Steny H. Hoyer  the majority leader of the House of Representatives. “She is the best candidate to beat Jeff Van Drew and turn this seat blue again ” Mr. Hoyer said in a statement. What debate there has been about issues has focused on infrastructure and economic needs along the Jersey Shore  health care reform and marijuana legalization. The district stretches from Atlantic City west to the Pennsylvania border. None None None None Professor Rasmussen  who helped run Mr. Van Drew’s campaigns for the State Legislature  said Ms. Kennedy’s opposition to legalizing marijuana is unlikely to trouble many general election voters in the moderate swing district where Mr. Trump won by five percentage points in 2016. But that has not stopped observers from noting the policy dissonance. “It’s concerning for any candidate to be ambivalent on legalization  especially any candidate who is purporting to be a progressive ” said Amol Sinha  executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey  which has assembled a broad coalition of groups pressing to legalize marijuana.  Both candidates have turned repeatedly to negative campaign messaging involving fund-raising  political alliances and the role of super PACs. None None Ms. Kennedy’s campaign has focused on Dr. Harrison’s alliance with Mr. Norcross  who cleared a path for her to run on the Democratic Party line in most of the district’s counties — much as he did for Mr. Van Drew in 2018. None Tuesday’s elections also are being viewed as a referendum on the vote-by-mail process  which is expected to lead to increased voter participation but has been marred by problems. Some voters got the wrong ballots  other ballots never reached voters. A glitch involving a bar code on the envelope caused some ballots to be returned in the mail to voters. “These primary elections are going to have an asterisk next to them ” Mr. Sweeney  the Senate president  said last week. None Amber McReynolds  chief executive of the National Vote at Home Institute  said expanded voting options are fundamentally healthy for democracy. “Just like in-person voting  just like early voting  there are risks ” she said. “It’s not an indictment of the policy. It’s just further demonstration that you have to implement it properly.” “It’s a science ” she added  “and an art.” Updated July 5  2020 None Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/politics/justice-department-barr-berman-congress-testimony.html,U.S. Attorney Ousted by Barr Will Testify Privately Before Congress Advertisement Supported by The interview with Geoffrey S. Berman  the former top federal prosecutor in Manhattan  is part of Democrats’ inquiry into potential Justice Department politicization. None WASHINGTON — Geoffrey S. Berman  the former top federal prosecutor in Manhattan who was abruptly dismissed last month  has agreed to testify in a closed-door hearing before lawmakers next week as part of an inquiry into potential politicization at the Justice Department  according to a House Judiciary Committee notice reviewed by The New York Times. None Mr. Berman’s planned testimony comes amid a shake-up at the federal prosecutor’s office in Brooklyn. Richard P. Donoghue  the office’s top prosecutor  will come to Washington to serve as the No. 2 official in the office of the deputy attorney general  Jeffrey A. Rosen  a key department post. Mr. Donoghue is seen within the department as a close ally of Mr. Barr. The position is currently held by Seth DuCharme  who plans to return to the Brooklyn prosecutor’s office  where he was previously the head of the criminal division. He is being considered to run the office  according to two people familiar with the deliberations. The moves  coming weeks after Mr. Berman’s firing  are likely to stir speculation that they are politically motivated. But President Trump has yet to nominate a successor to Mr. Donoghue  who expects his top deputy  Mark Lesko  to serve as the acting U.S. attorney immediately after his departure. Mr. Trump could install Mr. DuCharme to run the office under the Vacancies Reform Act. Under Mr. Berman  the Manhattan federal prosecutor’s office pursued cases that touched on Mr. Trump’s inner circle  exposing misdeeds by his former personal lawyer Michael D. Cohen. None None But Mr. Berman refused to resign  and Mr. Barr issued a news release late on a Friday night last month declaring that Mr. Berman intended to leave. That notice prompted Mr. Berman to publicly say that he had no intention of leaving. None Mr. Berman’s dismissal also came at a time when Mr. Trump had been pushing out other administration officials with a degree of independence  including inspectors general who are tasked with rooting out agency fraud and abuse. On Thursday  Mr. Donoghue  the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York  notified his office that he would be stepping down to become an official with the Justice Department in Washington  according to people familiar with the matter. None The job is particularly critical under Mr. Rosen  who has never been a prosecutor. Mr. DuCharme  who is Mr. Rosen’s current top deputy  will return to the Brooklyn office  where he had worked for his entire career as a prosecutor before he came to Washington last year to advise Mr. Barr on criminal and national security matters. Mr. Berman will testify just a week after two Justice Department lawyers told the House Judiciary Committee that political appointees in the prosecutor’s office in Washington and in the antitrust division had intervened in investigations to advance the personal interests of Mr. Trump and Mr. Barr. None He named several career lawyers who told him that the lenient sentence would be done essentially to appease Mr. Trump  and that the office’s top political appointee feared the president. A Justice Department spokeswoman has said that Mr. Zelinsky’s testimony was based on hearsay  and that he had no conversations with the political appointees whose intentions he described. John W. Elias  a senior career official in the antitrust division  said that Mr. Barr sought to use an antitrust investigation to harass cannabis companies because he personally disliked the industry. He also said that to please Mr. Trump  the division opened an investigation into automakers who had decided to make cars that emitted fewer pollutants. Leaders in the antitrust division denied those accusations in an internal memo circulated to the division. Their testimony and Mr. Berman’s interview are part of the House Judiciary Committee’s scrutiny of whether Mr. Barr has politicized the Justice Department and wielded its power to protect and support the interests of Mr. Trump. Mr. Barr will appear before the panel on July 28. Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/opinion/the-argument-protest-statue-revolution.html,Whose Statue Must Fall? Advertisement transcript I’m Michelle Goldberg. I’m Jamelle Bouie in for Frank Bruni. I’m Ross Douthat  and this is “The Argument.” [MUSIC PLAYING] On today’s show  are we living through a genuinely revolutionary moment  or will the protests just end up reshuffling elite institutions  leaving economic inequities untouched? Then we’ll talk about statues and monuments  which should stay and which should go. If we’re done with Robert E. Lee and maybe Woodrow Wilson  is George Washington next? For a revolutionary movement  the Black Lives Matter protests seem to have an awful lot of elites already on their side. Universities  media organizations  and much of corporate America have all rushed to endorse anti-racism and declare themselves in solidarity with protesters. To this skeptical conservative  it’s looking more like a struggle for power within the liberal elite  an ideological and generational battle to control Princeton or Google or The New York Times  and it’s not really the socialist revolution that Bernie Sanders was promising just a few short months ago. But the same week I wrote a column making that case  my colleague Jamelle Bouie wrote his own  arguing for this moment’s real revolutionary potential  the possibility that Black Lives Matter could yield a true socioeconomic transformation. Jamelle has kindly agreed to come back on The Argument today to join Michelle and I and explain what my cynicism might get wrong. So  Jamelle  first  welcome back to the show. Thank you for having me. You’re very welcome. And second  tell me what makes you think this moment isn’t just about corporate platitudes and elite infighting. So I think where I start is from a certain theory of revolution  which is regardless of the kind of revolution that it is  I don’t see them as planned and self-conscious  carried out by people who have an exact idea of what they’re doing. The better way to see revolutionary periods are periods where various actors with a variety of different agendas and ideas at hand take advantage of some basic instability and the overall political landscape. Depending on the nature of the instability  depending on the nature of the landscape  on what actors in power actually do  revolutionary moments can become genuine revolutions or they can not  and I think that’s true for more or less any revolution you think of — nothing set in stone  events unfold by a calculus that we can’t really predict. So having said that  I look at the current period  and there’s obviously a ton of instability. The governing regime is barely governing. There are legitimacy crises  I think  striking a number of institutions in this society  all tied to the response to the pandemic. And obviously there is this big legitimacy crisis over policing  which has really been building over the past decade. So I think my case is not that any particular thing will happen  but that this particular kind of protest movement  social change movement  they carry deeper implications for the entire social structure  for the political economy of the country that are present even in this moment  even if they aren’t necessarily going to emerge. But the implications are there. And the case I make in the piece is that you see this in each of the major racial justice movements in the country’s history  that ultimately the logic of them goes towards some transformation of the economy  given how tightly wound racial inequality and capitalist inequality is. There is something a little irrepressible about the inequality question that emerges from any attempt to tackle the racial one. So you can go quite a while down the road of racial inequality without necessarily touching those things  but eventually you come to a point where you have to begin addressing that. And I’d say even in this moment  even if you want to take the more cynical view of the current moment  that this is really an intra-elite fight  even there it raises questions about the distribution of power amongst black workers versus white workers  black elites and elite  institutions versus their white ones. And those questions  I think that the implications of them go beyond simply this intra-elite conflict. Ross  what do you mean by revolutionary? Because that’s something that I keep grappling with and I still don’t know quite how to think about  in part because you have this uprising  and aside from very specific demands about police reform  it’s not clear to me what the broader set of demands about social transformation are. I think you’re right that there’s this legitimacy crisis. Maybe there’s a lack of imagination  but it’s hard for me to imagine that we’re really in a revolutionary moment as opposed to a moment of ferment that will then lead to basically something recognizable to our current system but with some changes in distribution of power and wealth. Yeah. So I guess to clarify my own argument a little bit  I guess by revolutionary I’m trying to draw at least a partial contrast between what I think Bernie Sanders was trying to do in his socialist campaigns for the presidency and what I suspect is going to come out of the current moment now. And I think that distinction rests on my sense that basically since the 1960s and 1970s  America has generated a kind of mass upper class  who have combined a kind of rhetoric of pseudo radicalism  a kind of semi-hostile posture to the edifices of white patriarchy or something with a socioeconomic system that constantly ratifies and shores up their own privilege. So when I use the word revolution  I’m suggesting that a real revolution would be something that dramatically threatened the class privilege of these folks. And that’s my skepticism about the moment  and I think Jamelle is — you’re totally right  that inequities within that overclass are real and matter. And so it’s not a small thing to have elite institutions suddenly becoming more mindful of race and trying to become more racially diverse in their upper echelons. But it seems like there is an interesting tension in the way that you have this movement that is in the streets and acting like a classic revolutionary movement in certain ways  but at the same time  apart from Donald Trump and America’s police forces  every institution of power in the U.S. seems to be very quickly and officially on its side. And it seems to me that speaks to the way we’ve ended up crafting our upper class  where the upper class is very comfortable speaking a certain kind of language of social justice  so long as speaking that language works with maintaining their own economic privileges. I think that two things can be true here. The first  Ross  I think you’re right  it speaks to the nonthreatening nature of at least superficial demands for racial justice  as well as the extent to which the precipitating thing in all of this  the murder of George Floyd  was a genuinely horrible thing that struck a lot of people in a sincere way. But it speaks to both those things that this kind of movement  the rhetoric of it can be easily picked up by corporate and nonprofit in elite educational America. That’s  I think  absolutely true. But if you also take seriously that there is a bottom-up aspect to this  that there are people on the ground making quite concrete demands about changes they’d like to see in their communities  from defund or abolish the police to fundamental restructuring of how services and aid are provided to the community  if you take seriously this idea that even a superficial embrace of the rhetoric of this kind of thing opens up the rhetorical and I think political space for deeper critiques— so by 1970  conservative Republicans  or at least the Nixon administration  was touting black capitalism  was trying to channel the energies of the late stages of the civil rights movement into a more establishment-friendly path. At the same time  those energies did in fact drive pretty far-reaching restructurings of how the country worked  drove  we now know  not sustained but real efforts to desegregate and integrate large parts of the country  real efforts to redistribute wealth. So I think if that’s also true  then given how we may be very early in this current stage of upheaval  to me it’s not crazy to think that six months  a year  two years down the line  this will bear fruit in efforts to really actually go after the class position of some of the people currently touting the rhetoric. I don’t know if I included this in my column  but the real test of all of this is going to be  not at the national level but at the state and community level  efforts to desegregate schools and integrate neighborhoods and build affordable housing. That stuff flows quite naturally from the demands  from the rhetoric of activists on the ground. And what happens when good  white liberals have to confront that? That’s when the rubber hits the road  and it’s not actually clear to me what happens. My cynical sense says that that’s when it all falls apart. But who knows? And I think what makes this revolutionary is the extent to which I don’t know if we can really quite answer that question yet. What happens when those demands start getting made? I also think that it’s possible to see the way corporate America has picked up some of this language and bend over backwards to broadcast its sympathies to this movement as not a sign that corporate America is really comfortable with this movement  but that it’s afraid of this movement. So the quickest way to not run afoul of it  or to try to not run afoul of it or to try to pacify it  is to make all of these symbolic gestures. It’s often establishment fear of revolutionary possibility that leads to liberal reform. If elites get to the point where they’re really afraid of revolution  and I think some people are right now — if you look at that gun couple in St. Louis  those ridiculous people guarding their mansion from a peaceful protest  on the one hand  they’re absurd  and on the other hand  they are symbolic of elite fear. And they really said  we were afraid that this was going to be the French Revolution  that people were going to storm the Bastille. And if there’s people in power  people in the 1 percent who are really afraid of revolution  then the thing that they should be doing is trying to ameliorate the intense economic distress that is driving people or driving some segment of people into the streets in the first place. Let me ask you this  Jamelle. At this point in our history  where working class politics seems so fractured and you have a Democratic party that has been losing white working class voters for a very  very long time  if the move after police reform is  to take the cover of our own Sunday magazine this week  to make the case for reparations  it seems to me that that is less likely to build out a broader working class politics than the more class-centric stuff that Sanders was trying to do. Do you think that’s wrong? I think that you are probably right  almost certainly right  that if the demand moved to reparations have to happen now  that’s probably not going to bridge any divides among white working class people and non-white working class people because one of the points I think we’re saying here is that given who is most exposed to police violence  given what the actual conditions that produce high rates of violent crime are on the other end of that  I think you should understand demands for police reform and police abolition as being essentially class demands reflecting the position of people who are at the bottom of a race hierarchy. That’s always been the case  that the class demands of African-Americans in this country have always been tied up in these demands about personhood. But obviously given that there’s a gap in understanding with regards to white workers and the black working class  I think you’re right  that a call for reparations is probably not going to close that gap. It’s not crazy to me to think that if you’re calling for defund the police and use some of the funding to build services that address mental health issues and addiction  that demand is coming from a place of racial justice. But it’s also a class demand  and it also reflects conditions lived by other working people  non-black and white as well. And I think it’s entirely possible for activists who are on the ground doing this to connect these various forms of disadvantage  understanding that these particular things do have wider  broader  even Universalist implications  that solving them or attempting to address them builds out into something that could assist other people outside of that particular group. Well  right. And if you look at the people who’ve actually been ushered into politics  either by the Bernie Sanders revolution or adjacent to the Bernie Sanders movement  it’s not coal miners in West Virginia. It’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  it’s Ilhan Omar  it’s Jamaal Bowman. The idea of a multiracial working class politics that’s oriented simultaneously to economic justice and social justice  it’s not just theoretical. That is what this movement is producing at the level of electoral politics. That said  the place where I do worry about things going off the rails is if the movement and the face of the movement becomes less either about concrete demands for police reform or about this wave of electoral victories and becomes more about the performative anarchy of this Capitol Hill autonomous zone  or whatever they call it in Seattle  or even some of this  what seems to me  this really silly  cultish white self-flagellation that you see in books like “White Fragility.” And it’s not because I think that it’s so bad for white people to flagellate themselves  but just because it basically posits that you have these big structural problems and that the answer for this is for white people to do a ton of introspection and a ton of personal internal work on themselves  as opposed to just letting apartment buildings be built in their neighborhood or integrating their schools. I don’t think that one should underestimate the extent to which even upper-middle class white people coming to embrace the rhetoric of racial justice — I don’t think one should underestimate the extent to which that itself can be a radicalizing process and that one consequence may very well be a new constituency for economic and social reform programs among these people  who historically have been the political force— or whose political demands for these things have been pretty powerful. So I wouldn’t discount that possibility. And if anything  if we can be good Marxists for a minute  if race is this central contradiction of American capitalism  then if the professional middle class ends up trying to erase racism from its own ranks  it may make the other contradictions of our society much more clear to the extent to which they are rooted in class. So  hey  could go that way  too. All right  comrades. [LAUGHTER] As good Marxists  let’s end the segment there. And we’ll be right back to talk about a more specific symbolic element of this moment  the question of statues and monuments. [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome back. So who deserves a statue in America? Who deserves their statue to be taken down? It’s a question being asked all over the country  as people argue about whose version of history should be honored. And as protesters try to pull down an increasingly diverse array of monuments  cities and universities have responded with removals and renamings of their own. Jamelle  you live in Charlottesville  which was ground zero for an initial wave of these controversies  the debates about the removal of a Confederate memorial several years ago. How are you thinking about these questions? My own views on this are not settled. So it’s interesting  the Confederate statue question has basically been resolved  that I don’t think there’s really anyone making serious defenses of keeping up statues of Robert E. Lee. Well  it’s sort of still the position of the President of the United States  right? I don’t think anyone’s making serious defenses of keeping up statues of Robert E. Lee. [LAUGHTER] It is the position of the president  but you know. But actually  no  let me use that to sharpen my question because when this controversy started and Trump ended up defending Confederate memorials  one of the things he said was  well  if we take down Robert E. Lee  then  something like — I’m paraphrasing — George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are next. And at the time  I think the conventional wisdom was this is a ridiculous argument because you can obviously draw a distinction between statues put up to honor traitors and statues put up to honor the founders of the republic. But clearly  right now there is a lot of debate about whether that distinction actually holds. So do you think that distinction holds? So I do think that distinction holds  in part because I don’t think the reason to take down a statue of Robert E. Lee isn’t simply because they’re traitors. Maybe not even primarily because they’re traitors  but because they fought for a cause which we consider antithetical to American ideals  or at least a cause that represents that part of the founding America history that we want to repudiate  that we don’t want to honor in our public sphere. The reason why I want to move away from the traitor language is because I don’t have a problem with a memorial to John Brown  even though technically he was a traitor. It’s all about the underlying ideals. But if that’s the thing  then what do you do about figures like Thomas Jefferson  like George Washington? They represent at once the founding of the republic. They represent the high ideals that we associate with the American Revolution. But they also represent the interests and beliefs and ideals that we seek to get passed  that we seek to leave behind us. And I’m inclined  in part because of my sentimentality  in part because I do think that one should not dismiss the revolutionary potential of the revolution  and that means not discarding the figures who are part of that  I think that distinction holds. A monument is a statement about what we want our public memory to be  how we want it to be represented. And it is an open question whether or not you can honor any singular individual in that way  in a way that captures the full complexity of who that person was  in a way that does not erase the things that ought not be erased about that person. But  Jamelle  let me ask you a question because this is something that I feel quite conservative about. Obviously get rid of all of the Confederate statues. Throw them to the bottom of the river  behead them  whatever. But in terms of the distinction between people that we honor because they were racist  people that we honor because they fought for slavery  which is the Confederates  and people that are honored in spite of all their personal failings  which goes beyond just the founders — it’s also Abraham Lincoln  it’s definitely F.D.R.  who in my opinion is the best president. The best president was also the one who set up concentration camps for an ethnic minority. What frightens me about this kind of move to  again  defenestrate all these problematic figures is that what holds this country together besides some kind of civic mythology. Even if you think that it is  in some sense  a fairy tale  that it’s simplified  that it obscures a lot of human darkness  when I look at  for example  Nikole Hannah-Jones’s 1619 project  I think the point that she makes in that project is that it was only black people who forced the country to realize the ideals that it was founded on. And if you don’t have recourse to those ideals as a universal precept  I just don’t see what you replace them with  again  at a time when there just seems to be all of these centrifugal forces pulling the country apart. I think you see scenes in this country of these armed white militias  cars running into protesters  that if you saw it in another country  you would think it was on the verge of a Yugoslavia style breakup. And how you counteract that  I think you do need some sort of set of common understandings of what this country at its best is about. So I think I would push back a little at the notion that our civic mythology represents something collective. For most of the country’s history  our civic mythology was very much constructed around creating a white nationhood  is the best way I can put it. And so a couple weeks ago  people were knocking over statues of Christopher Columbus  and the whole reason Christopher Columbus became a figure of note in American civic religion is because Italian-Americans in the late 19th and early 20th century were looking for a way to signal that they are part of the polity in a way that Anglo-Americans were and German-Americans were. And it’s no accident that they glommed on to a Anglo-looking Italian  precisely because that was an attempt not just to claim Americanist  but to claim whiteness as well. And so part of what I think is happening is an attempt to really contest what that collective civic identity looks like because if you are going to include black Americans and Native Americans  in particular if they had been included 50 years ago or 100 years ago  the landscape wouldn’t look the way it does now  that their inclusion actually does force some difficult questions about what the physical representation of our collective memory looks like. That’s the first thing. The second thing  and this goes back to what I said a little earlier  I think we have to make a distinction between honoring individuals and then honoring other stuff. I would not push for taking down statues of Jefferson or F.D.R.  or whomever. But if we’re thinking of building new things  I’m not sure that what we should be looking for are individuals whom we can build a collective mythology around  but moments and events because that’s really what we’re talking about when we’re talking about the things that hold us together as Americans. It’s not simply George Washington. It is the founding. It is the writing and ratification of the Constitution. It’s not simply Abraham Lincoln. It is the Union Army  it is emancipation  it is the moments in which collectives  individuals working together  realize the ideals that we honor. The one thing I like about the F.D.R. memorial in D.C.  for example  is that it has an image of a bread line. It is a memorial not just to F.D.R.  but to people who suffered in the Depression. And if we are going to try to reconstruct a civic space  I really do think that we should move away from honoring individuals to begin with. Yeah  no  I agree with that. We’ve clearly continued the Marxist theme from the end of the first segment. [LAUGHTER] I’ll push back on that. I think that people remember — I think that memory is connected to personality and to individuals in a way that’s really hard to recreate with mass images. And I agree  I think something like the F.D.R. memorial  binding the particularities of F.D.R. to the general struggle of the Great Depression works reasonably well. But I guess my feeling about monuments is that there is a distinction. There is a American civic religion that you get in the apotheosis of George Washington inside the Capitol that is  to my mind  just basically blasphemous  a pseudo-religion of the American state that’s bad. And to the extent that that goes away  that’s a good thing. But a lot of what I think our statues and memorials exist to do is express a connection to an inheritance  to something that has been passed down to us that we value that would not exist but for the actions of particular people in particular times and places. So if you walk into the Jefferson Memorial  what’s there in the memorial  what’s celebrated around the statue of Jefferson are the idealistic things that he said and wrote that he obviously didn’t live up to at all in his own life. But it’s not a monument to the slave quarters at Monticello. It’s a monument to the Declaration of Independence. And so to my mind  the case for building more monuments and complexifying the American past in that way and creating a richer and truer memory is an incredibly strong one. And this isn’t just about black Americans. Put up more statues of Pontiac and Tecumseh and Crazy Horse  figures from the American-Indian inheritance. But for that to happen  you still have to have a sense — and this is where I think Michelle is totally right — that the original inheritance has value. And if you don’t feel that the original inheritance has value  then you don’t have a common culture to enrich. You just have  in effect  a small C civil war over memory. Something that struck me recently — and I forget exactly where this was. This may have been somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. Some activist wanted to take down a statue of Thomas Jefferson in front of an elementary school or a high school  or whatever. And the school is predominately black and underfunded and et cetera  and one of the advocates said it feels insulting to have this statue in front of this school with these conditions. And I’m kind of sympathetic to that. I’m sort of sympathetic to the idea that if we’re not even trying to live up to the ideals  then the thing feels a bit like a joke. Barack Obama’s Selma speech in particular is very much about this attempt to craft a unified American civic mythology from both traditional sources and from sources of protest  and that was rejected by a lot of Americans. And how much of what we’re seeing is a reaction to the rejection? I think that’s a totally fair point about Obama. I mean  yes  a portion of the American right didn’t listen to Obama’s attempts to do what you’re suggesting  Jamelle  and preemptively decided that he was a dangerous radical and read his racial rhetoric through that lens. And I think especially in his first term  Obama went out of his way to try and do what I think was the right thing to do  to build this common memory. He even laid a wreath on the Confederate memorial at Arlington cemetery  I think. At the same time  it isn’t actually the case that the country rejected Obama’s approach. Obama was elected president in the biggest landslide we’ve had recently  and then he was re-elected in pretty tough economic times. I didn’t say the country rejected him  I said many Americans did. Just want to make that clear. OK  no  that’s fair. But I’m just saying that it is the case that we elected Barack Obama president twice by substantial majorities and that he’s a vastly more popular figure than Donald Trump. And so if you’re thinking about  well  what is the possibility for America going forward  is it a common civic memory or is it a necessary war of all against all to root out white supremacy  the fact of Obama’s popularity and political success has to play into your thinking about that. I understand looking at the last 10 years and basically concluding that America has fundamentally failed  and that if a man like Donald Trump can become president  then there is something irredeemably rotten at the core. I don’t think it’s really possible to root that out  and I don’t feel like anybody has a clear idea of what could come next. It seems to me like there’s attempt to create something like a year zero  where we extirpate a corrupt history and start over. The difference is that it’s not clear to me that we have a coherent story or a coherent ideology or a coherent vision of society that replaces it. I think — this is the conservative defending of Barack Obama  that you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone. But I think the liberal narrative on race that I grew up with in liberal circles and that Obama represented the most prominent exemplar and defender of is a totally plausible narrative  that America had founding ideals that we didn’t live up to and that we fought a bloody civil war and came closer to living up to them and then we lost them again in reconstruction. And having that narrative enriched and made more historically honest by recognizing more fully the agency of black Americans enslaved and otherwise I think is a powerful contribution that doesn’t in any way require taking down statues of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. And I hate Jefferson. I wrote — [JAMELLE LAUGHS] I wrote a column about this today. In the founding  I’m totally an Adams guy. Jefferson  a total hypocrite who loves the French Revolution  which I’m obviously not for. Woodrow Wilson — I’ve hated Woodrow Wilson for 20 years. The fact remains that the good things that Jefferson did are crucial to the American founding and part of our inheritance. I think one thing the discussion broadly is having a hard time with is this sense that  to go back to the founding  the liberatory and freedom-seeking ideals of the founding exist side by side with the more parochial and hierarchical and counter-revolutionary ideals within the founding and that one isn’t more American than the other. They’re both very much part of the package. And part of the struggle in this moment is  I think  trying to reconcile that fact  trying to really internalize what it means. You can only remember so many things  and frankly  we don’t remember very many things at all in contemporary America. And so I don’t think it’s dishonest to say that we’re sifting the past and choosing which threads we decide to follow back and saying we’re going to clip some threads  like we’re clipping the Robert E. Lee and John C. Calhoun thread here. That’s OK  and it doesn’t mean that we’re abandoning the memory  that they’re slave holding was bad. It just means that we’re choosing threads to follow back in terms of how we  to Michelle’s point  bind up an actual national identity. Alright. I’ll give myself the last word.

We’ll see you next week. transcript I’m Michelle Goldberg. I’m Jamelle Bouie in for Frank Bruni. I’m Ross Douthat  and this is “The Argument.” [MUSIC PLAYING] On today’s show  are we living through a genuinely revolutionary moment  or will the protests just end up reshuffling elite institutions  leaving economic inequities untouched? Then we’ll talk about statues and monuments  which should stay and which should go. If we’re done with Robert E. Lee and maybe Woodrow Wilson  is George Washington next? For a revolutionary movement  the Black Lives Matter protests seem to have an awful lot of elites already on their side. Universities  media organizations  and much of corporate America have all rushed to endorse anti-racism and declare themselves in solidarity with protesters. To this skeptical conservative  it’s looking more like a struggle for power within the liberal elite  an ideological and generational battle to control Princeton or Google or The New York Times  and it’s not really the socialist revolution that Bernie Sanders was promising just a few short months ago. But the same week I wrote a column making that case  my colleague Jamelle Bouie wrote his own  arguing for this moment’s real revolutionary potential  the possibility that Black Lives Matter could yield a true socioeconomic transformation. Jamelle has kindly agreed to come back on The Argument today to join Michelle and I and explain what my cynicism might get wrong. So  Jamelle  first  welcome back to the show. Thank you for having me. You’re very welcome. And second  tell me what makes you think this moment isn’t just about corporate platitudes and elite infighting. So I think where I start is from a certain theory of revolution  which is regardless of the kind of revolution that it is  I don’t see them as planned and self-conscious  carried out by people who have an exact idea of what they’re doing. The better way to see revolutionary periods are periods where various actors with a variety of different agendas and ideas at hand take advantage of some basic instability and the overall political landscape. Depending on the nature of the instability  depending on the nature of the landscape  on what actors in power actually do  revolutionary moments can become genuine revolutions or they can not  and I think that’s true for more or less any revolution you think of — nothing set in stone  events unfold by a calculus that we can’t really predict. So having said that  I look at the current period  and there’s obviously a ton of instability. The governing regime is barely governing. There are legitimacy crises  I think  striking a number of institutions in this society  all tied to the response to the pandemic. And obviously there is this big legitimacy crisis over policing  which has really been building over the past decade. So I think my case is not that any particular thing will happen  but that this particular kind of protest movement  social change movement  they carry deeper implications for the entire social structure  for the political economy of the country that are present even in this moment  even if they aren’t necessarily going to emerge. But the implications are there. And the case I make in the piece is that you see this in each of the major racial justice movements in the country’s history  that ultimately the logic of them goes towards some transformation of the economy  given how tightly wound racial inequality and capitalist inequality is. There is something a little irrepressible about the inequality question that emerges from any attempt to tackle the racial one. So you can go quite a while down the road of racial inequality without necessarily touching those things  but eventually you come to a point where you have to begin addressing that. And I’d say even in this moment  even if you want to take the more cynical view of the current moment  that this is really an intra-elite fight  even there it raises questions about the distribution of power amongst black workers versus white workers  black elites and elite  institutions versus their white ones. And those questions  I think that the implications of them go beyond simply this intra-elite conflict. Ross  what do you mean by revolutionary? Because that’s something that I keep grappling with and I still don’t know quite how to think about  in part because you have this uprising  and aside from very specific demands about police reform  it’s not clear to me what the broader set of demands about social transformation are. I think you’re right that there’s this legitimacy crisis. Maybe there’s a lack of imagination  but it’s hard for me to imagine that we’re really in a revolutionary moment as opposed to a moment of ferment that will then lead to basically something recognizable to our current system but with some changes in distribution of power and wealth. Yeah. So I guess to clarify my own argument a little bit  I guess by revolutionary I’m trying to draw at least a partial contrast between what I think Bernie Sanders was trying to do in his socialist campaigns for the presidency and what I suspect is going to come out of the current moment now. And I think that distinction rests on my sense that basically since the 1960s and 1970s  America has generated a kind of mass upper class  who have combined a kind of rhetoric of pseudo radicalism  a kind of semi-hostile posture to the edifices of white patriarchy or something with a socioeconomic system that constantly ratifies and shores up their own privilege. So when I use the word revolution  I’m suggesting that a real revolution would be something that dramatically threatened the class privilege of these folks. And that’s my skepticism about the moment  and I think Jamelle is — you’re totally right  that inequities within that overclass are real and matter. And so it’s not a small thing to have elite institutions suddenly becoming more mindful of race and trying to become more racially diverse in their upper echelons. But it seems like there is an interesting tension in the way that you have this movement that is in the streets and acting like a classic revolutionary movement in certain ways  but at the same time  apart from Donald Trump and America’s police forces  every institution of power in the U.S. seems to be very quickly and officially on its side. And it seems to me that speaks to the way we’ve ended up crafting our upper class  where the upper class is very comfortable speaking a certain kind of language of social justice  so long as speaking that language works with maintaining their own economic privileges. I think that two things can be true here. The first  Ross  I think you’re right  it speaks to the nonthreatening nature of at least superficial demands for racial justice  as well as the extent to which the precipitating thing in all of this  the murder of George Floyd  was a genuinely horrible thing that struck a lot of people in a sincere way. But it speaks to both those things that this kind of movement  the rhetoric of it can be easily picked up by corporate and nonprofit in elite educational America. That’s  I think  absolutely true. But if you also take seriously that there is a bottom-up aspect to this  that there are people on the ground making quite concrete demands about changes they’d like to see in their communities  from defund or abolish the police to fundamental restructuring of how services and aid are provided to the community  if you take seriously this idea that even a superficial embrace of the rhetoric of this kind of thing opens up the rhetorical and I think political space for deeper critiques— so by 1970  conservative Republicans  or at least the Nixon administration  was touting black capitalism  was trying to channel the energies of the late stages of the civil rights movement into a more establishment-friendly path. At the same time  those energies did in fact drive pretty far-reaching restructurings of how the country worked  drove  we now know  not sustained but real efforts to desegregate and integrate large parts of the country  real efforts to redistribute wealth. So I think if that’s also true  then given how we may be very early in this current stage of upheaval  to me it’s not crazy to think that six months  a year  two years down the line  this will bear fruit in efforts to really actually go after the class position of some of the people currently touting the rhetoric. I don’t know if I included this in my column  but the real test of all of this is going to be  not at the national level but at the state and community level  efforts to desegregate schools and integrate neighborhoods and build affordable housing. That stuff flows quite naturally from the demands  from the rhetoric of activists on the ground. And what happens when good  white liberals have to confront that? That’s when the rubber hits the road  and it’s not actually clear to me what happens. My cynical sense says that that’s when it all falls apart. But who knows? And I think what makes this revolutionary is the extent to which I don’t know if we can really quite answer that question yet. What happens when those demands start getting made? I also think that it’s possible to see the way corporate America has picked up some of this language and bend over backwards to broadcast its sympathies to this movement as not a sign that corporate America is really comfortable with this movement  but that it’s afraid of this movement. So the quickest way to not run afoul of it  or to try to not run afoul of it or to try to pacify it  is to make all of these symbolic gestures. It’s often establishment fear of revolutionary possibility that leads to liberal reform. If elites get to the point where they’re really afraid of revolution  and I think some people are right now — if you look at that gun couple in St. Louis  those ridiculous people guarding their mansion from a peaceful protest  on the one hand  they’re absurd  and on the other hand  they are symbolic of elite fear. And they really said  we were afraid that this was going to be the French Revolution  that people were going to storm the Bastille. And if there’s people in power  people in the 1 percent who are really afraid of revolution  then the thing that they should be doing is trying to ameliorate the intense economic distress that is driving people or driving some segment of people into the streets in the first place. Let me ask you this  Jamelle. At this point in our history  where working class politics seems so fractured and you have a Democratic party that has been losing white working class voters for a very  very long time  if the move after police reform is  to take the cover of our own Sunday magazine this week  to make the case for reparations  it seems to me that that is less likely to build out a broader working class politics than the more class-centric stuff that Sanders was trying to do. Do you think that’s wrong? I think that you are probably right  almost certainly right  that if the demand moved to reparations have to happen now  that’s probably not going to bridge any divides among white working class people and non-white working class people because one of the points I think we’re saying here is that given who is most exposed to police violence  given what the actual conditions that produce high rates of violent crime are on the other end of that  I think you should understand demands for police reform and police abolition as being essentially class demands reflecting the position of people who are at the bottom of a race hierarchy. That’s always been the case  that the class demands of African-Americans in this country have always been tied up in these demands about personhood. But obviously given that there’s a gap in understanding with regards to white workers and the black working class  I think you’re right  that a call for reparations is probably not going to close that gap. It’s not crazy to me to think that if you’re calling for defund the police and use some of the funding to build services that address mental health issues and addiction  that demand is coming from a place of racial justice. But it’s also a class demand  and it also reflects conditions lived by other working people  non-black and white as well. And I think it’s entirely possible for activists who are on the ground doing this to connect these various forms of disadvantage  understanding that these particular things do have wider  broader  even Universalist implications  that solving them or attempting to address them builds out into something that could assist other people outside of that particular group. Well  right. And if you look at the people who’ve actually been ushered into politics  either by the Bernie Sanders revolution or adjacent to the Bernie Sanders movement  it’s not coal miners in West Virginia. It’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  it’s Ilhan Omar  it’s Jamaal Bowman. The idea of a multiracial working class politics that’s oriented simultaneously to economic justice and social justice  it’s not just theoretical. That is what this movement is producing at the level of electoral politics. That said  the place where I do worry about things going off the rails is if the movement and the face of the movement becomes less either about concrete demands for police reform or about this wave of electoral victories and becomes more about the performative anarchy of this Capitol Hill autonomous zone  or whatever they call it in Seattle  or even some of this  what seems to me  this really silly  cultish white self-flagellation that you see in books like “White Fragility.” And it’s not because I think that it’s so bad for white people to flagellate themselves  but just because it basically posits that you have these big structural problems and that the answer for this is for white people to do a ton of introspection and a ton of personal internal work on themselves  as opposed to just letting apartment buildings be built in their neighborhood or integrating their schools. I don’t think that one should underestimate the extent to which even upper-middle class white people coming to embrace the rhetoric of racial justice — I don’t think one should underestimate the extent to which that itself can be a radicalizing process and that one consequence may very well be a new constituency for economic and social reform programs among these people  who historically have been the political force— or whose political demands for these things have been pretty powerful. So I wouldn’t discount that possibility. And if anything  if we can be good Marxists for a minute  if race is this central contradiction of American capitalism  then if the professional middle class ends up trying to erase racism from its own ranks  it may make the other contradictions of our society much more clear to the extent to which they are rooted in class. So  hey  could go that way  too. All right  comrades. [LAUGHTER] As good Marxists  let’s end the segment there. And we’ll be right back to talk about a more specific symbolic element of this moment  the question of statues and monuments. [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome back. So who deserves a statue in America? Who deserves their statue to be taken down? It’s a question being asked all over the country  as people argue about whose version of history should be honored. And as protesters try to pull down an increasingly diverse array of monuments  cities and universities have responded with removals and renamings of their own. Jamelle  you live in Charlottesville  which was ground zero for an initial wave of these controversies  the debates about the removal of a Confederate memorial several years ago. How are you thinking about these questions? My own views on this are not settled. So it’s interesting  the Confederate statue question has basically been resolved  that I don’t think there’s really anyone making serious defenses of keeping up statues of Robert E. Lee. Well  it’s sort of still the position of the President of the United States  right? I don’t think anyone’s making serious defenses of keeping up statues of Robert E. Lee. [LAUGHTER] It is the position of the president  but you know. But actually  no  let me use that to sharpen my question because when this controversy started and Trump ended up defending Confederate memorials  one of the things he said was  well  if we take down Robert E. Lee  then  something like — I’m paraphrasing — George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are next. And at the time  I think the conventional wisdom was this is a ridiculous argument because you can obviously draw a distinction between statues put up to honor traitors and statues put up to honor the founders of the republic. But clearly  right now there is a lot of debate about whether that distinction actually holds. So do you think that distinction holds? So I do think that distinction holds  in part because I don’t think the reason to take down a statue of Robert E. Lee isn’t simply because they’re traitors. Maybe not even primarily because they’re traitors  but because they fought for a cause which we consider antithetical to American ideals  or at least a cause that represents that part of the founding America history that we want to repudiate  that we don’t want to honor in our public sphere. The reason why I want to move away from the traitor language is because I don’t have a problem with a memorial to John Brown  even though technically he was a traitor. It’s all about the underlying ideals. But if that’s the thing  then what do you do about figures like Thomas Jefferson  like George Washington? They represent at once the founding of the republic. They represent the high ideals that we associate with the American Revolution. But they also represent the interests and beliefs and ideals that we seek to get passed  that we seek to leave behind us. And I’m inclined  in part because of my sentimentality  in part because I do think that one should not dismiss the revolutionary potential of the revolution  and that means not discarding the figures who are part of that  I think that distinction holds. A monument is a statement about what we want our public memory to be  how we want it to be represented. And it is an open question whether or not you can honor any singular individual in that way  in a way that captures the full complexity of who that person was  in a way that does not erase the things that ought not be erased about that person. But  Jamelle  let me ask you a question because this is something that I feel quite conservative about. Obviously get rid of all of the Confederate statues. Throw them to the bottom of the river  behead them  whatever. But in terms of the distinction between people that we honor because they were racist  people that we honor because they fought for slavery  which is the Confederates  and people that are honored in spite of all their personal failings  which goes beyond just the founders — it’s also Abraham Lincoln  it’s definitely F.D.R.  who in my opinion is the best president. The best president was also the one who set up concentration camps for an ethnic minority. What frightens me about this kind of move to  again  defenestrate all these problematic figures is that what holds this country together besides some kind of civic mythology. Even if you think that it is  in some sense  a fairy tale  that it’s simplified  that it obscures a lot of human darkness  when I look at  for example  Nikole Hannah-Jones’s 1619 project  I think the point that she makes in that project is that it was only black people who forced the country to realize the ideals that it was founded on. And if you don’t have recourse to those ideals as a universal precept  I just don’t see what you replace them with  again  at a time when there just seems to be all of these centrifugal forces pulling the country apart. I think you see scenes in this country of these armed white militias  cars running into protesters  that if you saw it in another country  you would think it was on the verge of a Yugoslavia style breakup. And how you counteract that  I think you do need some sort of set of common understandings of what this country at its best is about. So I think I would push back a little at the notion that our civic mythology represents something collective. For most of the country’s history  our civic mythology was very much constructed around creating a white nationhood  is the best way I can put it. And so a couple weeks ago  people were knocking over statues of Christopher Columbus  and the whole reason Christopher Columbus became a figure of note in American civic religion is because Italian-Americans in the late 19th and early 20th century were looking for a way to signal that they are part of the polity in a way that Anglo-Americans were and German-Americans were. And it’s no accident that they glommed on to a Anglo-looking Italian  precisely because that was an attempt not just to claim Americanist  but to claim whiteness as well. And so part of what I think is happening is an attempt to really contest what that collective civic identity looks like because if you are going to include black Americans and Native Americans  in particular if they had been included 50 years ago or 100 years ago  the landscape wouldn’t look the way it does now  that their inclusion actually does force some difficult questions about what the physical representation of our collective memory looks like. That’s the first thing. The second thing  and this goes back to what I said a little earlier  I think we have to make a distinction between honoring individuals and then honoring other stuff. I would not push for taking down statues of Jefferson or F.D.R.  or whomever. But if we’re thinking of building new things  I’m not sure that what we should be looking for are individuals whom we can build a collective mythology around  but moments and events because that’s really what we’re talking about when we’re talking about the things that hold us together as Americans. It’s not simply George Washington. It is the founding. It is the writing and ratification of the Constitution. It’s not simply Abraham Lincoln. It is the Union Army  it is emancipation  it is the moments in which collectives  individuals working together  realize the ideals that we honor. The one thing I like about the F.D.R. memorial in D.C.  for example  is that it has an image of a bread line. It is a memorial not just to F.D.R.  but to people who suffered in the Depression. And if we are going to try to reconstruct a civic space  I really do think that we should move away from honoring individuals to begin with. Yeah  no  I agree with that. We’ve clearly continued the Marxist theme from the end of the first segment. [LAUGHTER] I’ll push back on that. I think that people remember — I think that memory is connected to personality and to individuals in a way that’s really hard to recreate with mass images. And I agree  I think something like the F.D.R. memorial  binding the particularities of F.D.R. to the general struggle of the Great Depression works reasonably well. But I guess my feeling about monuments is that there is a distinction. There is a American civic religion that you get in the apotheosis of George Washington inside the Capitol that is  to my mind  just basically blasphemous  a pseudo-religion of the American state that’s bad. And to the extent that that goes away  that’s a good thing. But a lot of what I think our statues and memorials exist to do is express a connection to an inheritance  to something that has been passed down to us that we value that would not exist but for the actions of particular people in particular times and places. So if you walk into the Jefferson Memorial  what’s there in the memorial  what’s celebrated around the statue of Jefferson are the idealistic things that he said and wrote that he obviously didn’t live up to at all in his own life. But it’s not a monument to the slave quarters at Monticello. It’s a monument to the Declaration of Independence. And so to my mind  the case for building more monuments and complexifying the American past in that way and creating a richer and truer memory is an incredibly strong one. And this isn’t just about black Americans. Put up more statues of Pontiac and Tecumseh and Crazy Horse  figures from the American-Indian inheritance. But for that to happen  you still have to have a sense — and this is where I think Michelle is totally right — that the original inheritance has value. And if you don’t feel that the original inheritance has value  then you don’t have a common culture to enrich. You just have  in effect  a small C civil war over memory. Something that struck me recently — and I forget exactly where this was. This may have been somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. Some activist wanted to take down a statue of Thomas Jefferson in front of an elementary school or a high school  or whatever. And the school is predominately black and underfunded and et cetera  and one of the advocates said it feels insulting to have this statue in front of this school with these conditions. And I’m kind of sympathetic to that. I’m sort of sympathetic to the idea that if we’re not even trying to live up to the ideals  then the thing feels a bit like a joke. Barack Obama’s Selma speech in particular is very much about this attempt to craft a unified American civic mythology from both traditional sources and from sources of protest  and that was rejected by a lot of Americans. And how much of what we’re seeing is a reaction to the rejection? I think that’s a totally fair point about Obama. I mean  yes  a portion of the American right didn’t listen to Obama’s attempts to do what you’re suggesting  Jamelle  and preemptively decided that he was a dangerous radical and read his racial rhetoric through that lens. And I think especially in his first term  Obama went out of his way to try and do what I think was the right thing to do  to build this common memory. He even laid a wreath on the Confederate memorial at Arlington cemetery  I think. At the same time  it isn’t actually the case that the country rejected Obama’s approach. Obama was elected president in the biggest landslide we’ve had recently  and then he was re-elected in pretty tough economic times. I didn’t say the country rejected him  I said many Americans did. Just want to make that clear. OK  no  that’s fair. But I’m just saying that it is the case that we elected Barack Obama president twice by substantial majorities and that he’s a vastly more popular figure than Donald Trump. And so if you’re thinking about  well  what is the possibility for America going forward  is it a common civic memory or is it a necessary war of all against all to root out white supremacy  the fact of Obama’s popularity and political success has to play into your thinking about that. I understand looking at the last 10 years and basically concluding that America has fundamentally failed  and that if a man like Donald Trump can become president  then there is something irredeemably rotten at the core. I don’t think it’s really possible to root that out  and I don’t feel like anybody has a clear idea of what could come next. It seems to me like there’s attempt to create something like a year zero  where we extirpate a corrupt history and start over. The difference is that it’s not clear to me that we have a coherent story or a coherent ideology or a coherent vision of society that replaces it. I think — this is the conservative defending of Barack Obama  that you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone. But I think the liberal narrative on race that I grew up with in liberal circles and that Obama represented the most prominent exemplar and defender of is a totally plausible narrative  that America had founding ideals that we didn’t live up to and that we fought a bloody civil war and came closer to living up to them and then we lost them again in reconstruction. And having that narrative enriched and made more historically honest by recognizing more fully the agency of black Americans enslaved and otherwise I think is a powerful contribution that doesn’t in any way require taking down statues of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. And I hate Jefferson. I wrote — [JAMELLE LAUGHS] I wrote a column about this today. In the founding  I’m totally an Adams guy. Jefferson  a total hypocrite who loves the French Revolution  which I’m obviously not for. Woodrow Wilson — I’ve hated Woodrow Wilson for 20 years. The fact remains that the good things that Jefferson did are crucial to the American founding and part of our inheritance. I think one thing the discussion broadly is having a hard time with is this sense that  to go back to the founding  the liberatory and freedom-seeking ideals of the founding exist side by side with the more parochial and hierarchical and counter-revolutionary ideals within the founding and that one isn’t more American than the other. They’re both very much part of the package. And part of the struggle in this moment is  I think  trying to reconcile that fact  trying to really internalize what it means. You can only remember so many things  and frankly  we don’t remember very many things at all in contemporary America. And so I don’t think it’s dishonest to say that we’re sifting the past and choosing which threads we decide to follow back and saying we’re going to clip some threads  like we’re clipping the Robert E. Lee and John C. Calhoun thread here. That’s OK  and it doesn’t mean that we’re abandoning the memory  that they’re slave holding was bad. It just means that we’re choosing threads to follow back in terms of how we  to Michelle’s point  bind up an actual national identity. Alright. I’ll give myself the last word.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/us/politics/michael-flynn-sidney-powell.html,How Michael Flynn’s Defense Team Found Powerful Allies Advertisement Supported by A lawyer for the former national security adviser turned to the attorney general for help  and he delivered  months before a pair of appellate judges handed Mr. Flynn another legal victory. None WASHINGTON — Sidney Powell  a firebrand lawyer whose pugnacious Fox News appearances had earned her numerous private phone conversations with President Trump  sent a letter last year to Attorney General William P. Barr about her soon-to-be new client  Michael T. Flynn. Asking for “utmost confidentiality ” Ms. Powell told Mr. Barr that the case against Mr. Flynn  the president’s former national security adviser who had pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.  smacked of “corruption of our beloved government institutions for what appears to be political purposes.” She asked the attorney general to appoint an outsider to review the case  confident that such scrutiny would justify ending it. Mr. Barr did what she wanted. He appointed a U.S. attorney six months later to scour the Flynn case file with a skeptical eye for documents that could be turned over as helpful to the defense. Ultimately  Mr. Barr directed the department to drop the charge  one of his numerous steps undercutting the work of the Russia investigation and the special counsel  Robert S. Mueller III. The private correspondence between Ms. Powell and Mr. Barr  disclosed in a little-noticed court filing last fall  was the first step toward a once-obscure lawyer and a powerful attorney general finding common cause in a battle to dismantle the legacy of the investigations into President Trump and his allies. Ms. Powell’s slash-and-burn approach — accusing the federal law enforcement machinery of concocting a case against her client — failed in the courtroom last year when a judge rejected her claims. But the same strategy  which she amplified in frequent media appearances  succeeded in turning Mr. Flynn’s case into a cause for Mr. Trump’s supporters and in securing the review ordered by Mr. Barr that provided her with fresh ammunition. Mr. Barr’s subsequent decision to drop the charge against Mr. Flynn threw the Justice Department into turmoil and set up a high-stakes battle pitting the attorney general and Ms. Powell against the trial judge  Emmet G. Sullivan  who opened a review of the move. None Ms. Powell declined to discuss her conversations with the White House or her correspondence with Mr. Barr. But she said in an email that she had long considered “prosecutorial misconduct and overreach” a problem and that she viewed Mr. Flynn as a victim of it. At its core  Mr. Flynn’s case is a drama about who gets to mete out justice in the Trump era  upending the prosecution of a man who twice had admitted guilt. “It’s hard to think of anything remotely like this ” said David Alan Sklansky  a Stanford University law professor and former federal prosecutor. “The Justice Department has taken somebody who has twice pleaded guilty  in a case where the trial judge has considered and already rejected claims of government wrongdoing  and prosecutors now say we’d like to dismiss the case and don’t think it should have been brought in the first place.” When Mr. Flynn stood in Judge Sullivan’s courtroom on Dec. 18  2018  his legal odyssey appeared to be over. He had struck a favorable deal with Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors to cooperate after admitting to lying to F.B.I. agents about conversations with the Russian ambassador in late 2016. In exchange  prosecutors were recommending he receive no prison time and not be prosecuted for separate offenses related to his lobbying for Turkish government without registering as an agent of a foreign power. But he did not go quietly. His defense team  in a memo laying out what sentence he should receive  also floated the notion that Mr. Flynn had been set up. F.B.I. agents had used several different tactics to essentially trick Mr. Flynn  a retired Army three-star general  into making false statements  the memo suggested. The Flynn defense team was trying to have it both ways  and Judge Sullivan was furious. He grilled Mr. Flynn about whether he was truly taking responsibility for his crimes and even suggested — before retracting the notion — that Mr. Flynn had been a traitor to his country. When it appeared that Judge Sullivan might send Mr. Flynn to prison  going beyond the original recommendation of prosecutors  Mr. Flynn and his lawyer  Robert K. Kelner  decided to postpone the sentencing so he could continue to cooperate with prosecutors. Judge Sullivan  appointed to the Federal District Court by President Bill Clinton  has a reputation as a hard-nosed jurist with a disdain for prosecutorial misconduct. He is known for taking guilty pleas seriously  and he reminded Mr. Kelner that he had never accepted one from someone who maintained he was not guilty and that he didn’t “intend to start today.” In his legal pivot  Mr. Flynn had channeled the campaign led by Mr. Trump and his allies that had portrayed the Russia investigation as a “witch hunt” and a plot to sabotage his presidency. Since Mr. Flynn had first pleaded guilty in 2017  Republicans in Congress had taken up a campaign to undermine the case against him and portray him as a victim of overzealous prosecutors. Some legal experts speculated at the time that Mr. Flynn was accepting guilt to pocket a sentence without prison time while also preserving the possibility that Mr. Trump might pardon him. His legal strategy would  soon enough  become even more radical: that he was innocent all along. One of Mr. Flynn’s most vocal defenders was Ms. Powell  a Texas-based former federal prosecutor who had made no secret about her view that the Russia investigation was a sham. She appeared frequently on Fox News and had a website hawking T-shirts mocking Mr. Mueller’s team as “creeps on a mission.” None She called him the “perfect judge” for it because of his handling years earlier of the corruption case against former Senator Ted Stevens  Republican of Alaska. In that case  Judge Sullivan had been so furious after the Justice Department disclosed that it had failed to turn over evidence potentially helpful to the defense that he opened an ethics investigation into the prosecutors. The department ended up asking Judge Sullivan to dismiss the case despite having won a guilty verdict — an outcome Ms. Powell seemed to view as a road map for Mr. Flynn. Her television advocacy on behalf of Mr. Flynn appears to have had an influential viewer: the president. The two spoke five times in 2019  during the months before she officially took on Mr. Flynn as a client  according to a person familiar with the calls. It is unclear what they discussed  but when Ms. Powell persuaded Mr. Flynn and his family to drop his original legal team and allow her to take up the case  the president was thrilled. None She previewed her defense strategy in the secret letter to Mr. Barr  asking him to begin a hunt for materials that the department could turn over. “At the end of this internal review  we believe there will be ample justification for the department to follow the precedent of the Ted Stevens case and move to dismiss the prosecution of General Flynn in the interest of justice ” she wrote. As Mr. Flynn’s lawyer  she began demanding that the Justice Department turn over more files  including documents that were tangential to her client’s case but promoted other right-wing conspiracy theories about the Russia investigation. She accused the F.B.I. and prosecutors of engaging in a litany of misconduct that “impugned their entire case against Mr. Flynn  while at the same time putting excruciating pressure on him to enter his guilty plea and manipulating or controlling the press to their advantage to extort that plea.” Exasperated prosecutors attacked Ms. Powell’s legal strategy  saying the “defendant and his new counsel are in search of a result  not the facts.” She also made clear that her client was done helping the Justice Department. Almost immediately after she began representing Mr. Flynn  he changed his story in a prosecution in Virginia against his former business partner about their work for Turkey. Prosecutors decided against calling him as a witness  significantly weakening their case. Months later  it was Ms. Powell’s defense of Mr. Flynn that was collapsing. In December  Judge Sullivan delivered a stinging rebuke to her wide-ranging claims of prosecutorial misconduct and other accusations. In a 92-page opinion  he marched through her allegations and rejected each one. It turned out that Judge Sullivan was not the savior that Ms. Powell was looking for  he even ruled that Mr. Flynn was no Ted Stevens. But in a different way  her strategy had been a success: The case had become a political cause. While Judge Sullivan rejected Ms. Powell’s claims of material law enforcement misconduct as baseless  Fox News and other conservative news outlets had amplified them along the way. None This political chorus had already been hard at work trying to undermine the conclusions of the voluminous special counsel’s report. Mr. Mueller concluded that Russia systematically tried to sabotage the 2016 election and that Mr. Trump’s advisers had welcomed the help — even if he concluded there was insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy. He also found numerous times when Mr. Trump tried to impede the Russia investigation  but chose not to determine whether the president had illegally obstructed justice. Weeks after Judge Sullivan rejected Ms. Powell’s assertions of prosecutorial misconduct and was preparing to sentence Mr. Flynn  Ms. Powell persuaded her client to ask to withdraw his guilty plea and declare to the judge that he was innocent. Meanwhile  Mr. Barr was moving to take direct control over the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia  which was handling several politically charged matters. Mr. Barr maneuvered the Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney  Jessie K. Liu  into leaving early  and imposed his own aide  Timothy J. Shea  as the acting head of the office. At the same time  he appointed the U.S. attorney for St. Louis  Jeffrey B. Jensen  to examine the Flynn case. It was exactly what Ms. Powell had asked Mr. Barr to do in her secret letter six months earlier. Mr. Jensen scoured F.B.I. files in search of anything that could be construed as so-called Brady material — information Mr. Flynn could use to argue that he was not guilty — which had been withheld from the defense. He found several files. Many fell into a category of things that made the F.B.I. look heavy-handed  but did not change the narrow issue of whether Mr. Flynn made false statements to the agents who questioned him. But Ms. Powell seized on the revelations as proof that prosecutors had improperly withheld exculpatory evidence  justifying a dismissal of the case. Mr. Barr directed his department to file a motion to dismiss the charge. None It also forced a showdown with Judge Sullivan  who had no intention of abandoning the case so easily. None Trying to head that off  Ms. Powell asked an appeals panel to order Judge Sullivan to end the case without any review of the motivation or legitimacy of the request. Legal experts widely scoffed at her tactic  noting that such orders are supposed to be reserved for rare problems where no other option exists. But Ms. Powell’s gambit led to a stroke of luck. The case was randomly assigned to a three-judge panel that included Judge Rao and Judge Karen L. Henderson  a 1990 appointee of President George Bush  who have both proved more willing than most of their colleagues to interpret the law in Mr. Trump’s favor in politically charged cases. In a 2-to-1 ruling  the panel ordered Judge Sullivan to shut down the case immediately  saying he had no authority to scrutinize the basis for Mr. Barr’s decision. The dissenting judge on the panel accused his colleagues of “grievously” overstepping their authority. The ruling turned on a technical question rather than the merits of the case  and it remains to be seen whether the full appeals court will let it stand.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/roger-stone-prison.html,Judge Orders Roger Stone to Report to Prison Next Month Advertisement Supported by President Trump’s friend had sought a longer reprieve before he serves his sentence on seven felony convictions  citing the pandemic. None WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Friday denied a request by President Trump’s friend Roger J. Stone Jr. for a two-month delay before he begins serving his prison term  despite the fact that his motion was unopposed by the Justice Department. Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted Mr. Stone an additional two weeks before he must report to a federal prison in Jesup  Ga.  but ordered him placed under home confinement in the meantime. None The Bureau of Prisons initially ordered Mr. Stone  67  to report to prison in April  then put off the date until June 30 after the judge  in an order denying him a new trial  said his imprisonment should begin no sooner than April 30. Then this month  citing the pandemic  Mr. Stone asked Judge Jackson to delay his imprisonment until Sept. 1. He noted his age and health concerns  which were not publicly revealed. In a nod to the intense criticism over the Justice Department’s handling of the case  prosecutors told Judge Jackson that they did not oppose the delay — but purely because of department guidelines for defendants who are about to begin their prison terms and pose no risk of flight or threat to public safety. “There is no instance in which this office has opposed a request to extend a self-surrender date during the pandemic ” prosecutors in Washington said this week in a filing to the judge. The department’s stance was drafted “to conform with our policy and practice — and for no other reason ” its lawyers said. That seemed to conflict with a statement from Mr. Stone’s lawyers. Their filing to the judge said government lawyers had told them this month that the Bureau of Prisons “was no longer extending surrender dates based on Covid-19 and that  therefore  B.O.P. would not be changing Stone’s June 30  2020  surrender date.” After further discussions  Mr. Stone’s lawyers said  they were informed that the department would not oppose his request for a delay. The Justice Department’s handling of Mr. Stone’s case has been deeply fraught. He was one of a string of former Trump aides who were charged as a result of the investigation by the special counsel  Robert S. Mueller III  into Russian interference in the 2016 election. None None Mr. Barr has dismissed Mr. Zelinsky’s account as hearsay. The coronavirus has been spreading through federal prisons. So far  89 inmates and one staff member have died of the disease  according to Bureau of Prisons statistics. In an Instagram post this month  Mr. Stone complained that he had been ordered to serve his sentence in a prison that had a “substantial” problem with the virus  while other high-profile prisoners were granted reprieves. But Judge Jackson wrote that Mr. Stone’s prison was as yet “unaffected.” She said two weeks of home confinement for Mr. Stone would help protect other inmates “who share defendant’s anxiety over the potential introduction and spread of the virus.” Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/politics/michael-flynn-appeals-court.html,Appeals Court Panel Orders End to Michael Flynn Case Advertisement Supported by Two appellate judges ordered a lower-court judge to dismiss a charge against President Trump’s former national security adviser. A third judge accused them of overstepping their powers. None None In the ruling  two of three judges on a panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered the trial judge overseeing the matter  Emmet G. Sullivan  to immediately dismiss the case without further review. The third accused his colleagues of “grievously” overstepping their powers. But the full appeals court has the option of reviewing the matter  and Judge Sullivan did not immediately dismiss the case in response to the ruling. Instead  he suspended deadlines for further briefs and a July 16 hearing in his review  suggesting he was studying his options or waiting to see what the broader group of judges might do. The order from the panel — a so-called writ of mandamus — was rare and came as a surprise  taking its place as yet another twist in the extraordinary legal and political drama surrounding the prosecution of Mr. Flynn  who twice pleaded guilty to lying to F.B.I. agents in the Russia investigation about his conversations in December 2016 with the Russian ambassador to the United States. None But before ruling on that request  Judge Sullivan appointed a former judge to critique the government’s motion. Mr. Flynn’s defense lawyer  Sidney Powell  then asked the federal appeals court to order Judge Sullivan to shut down that review and terminate the matter. Widely seen as a long shot by many legal experts  her strategy succeeded — at least for now. None She added  “On that  both the Constitution and cases are clear: He may not.” None The ruling turned on a technical question — whether  as a legal matter  Judge Sullivan had the authority to scrutinize Mr. Barr’s motivation or had to acquiesce to the Justice Department request that he rubber-stamp dropping the case without reviewing the motion’s legitimacy. But at a House Judiciary Committee hearing titled “Political Interference and Threats to Prosecutorial Independence” on Wednesday  where two Justice Department officials testified about other law enforcement decisions by and under Mr. Barr  Republican lawmakers treated the ruling as vindicating the attorney general’s claim that the Flynn case was unjust on the merits. “We obviously know the Flynn charge was wrong as evidenced by what happened today ” said Representative Jim Jordan  Republican of Ohio. At the White House  Mr. Trump told reporters he was “very happy about General Flynn ” adding: “He’s been exonerated  and I want to congratulate him.” But Representative Steve Cohen  Democrat of Tennessee  called on the full appeals court to review the panel’s decision  arguing at the House hearing that judges should be able to “look into the executive branch when what they do is not in the interest of justice.” He also portrayed Judge Rao in political terms  noting that until she became a judge last year  she had led a White House agency that oversees regulations. Under Mr. Trump  he said  that agency “does what Trump likes best  which is jeopardize the safe air and water of the American public and give into industry and profits and pollution. And she did a good job of it.” Judge Rao’s decision not to permit Judge Sullivan to scrutinize the Justice Department request to withdraw the Flynn charge was joined by Judge Karen L. Henderson  a 1990 appointee of President George Bush. None But the ruling was nevertheless a surprise because both of them — and Judge Henderson in particular — had asked many questions during oral arguments this month that seemed to signal skepticism about short-circuiting Judge Sullivan’s review. A third judge on the panel  Robert L. Wilkins  a 2014 appointee of President Barack Obama  dissented. He said Judge Sullivan should be permitted to complete his review of whether the prosecutor’s actions were impermissible before deciding whether to grant the motion to dismiss  citing the unusual circumstances of the Justice Department’s “abrupt reversal on the facts and the law” and the opacity of what happened. In a dissenting opinion  he said his colleagues had made a series of mistakes that rendered a “dead letter” the portion of the rule of criminal procedure that says cases may only be dismissed with a judge’s approval  or “leave of the court” — at least when the defense and prosecution agree that a case should be dropped. Instead  he argued  the law requires that Judge Sullivan be permitted to rule — and if Mr. Flynn and the Justice Department do not like what he decides  they can then appeal. “The District Court must be given a reasonable opportunity to consider and hold a hearing on the government’s request to ensure that it is not clearly contrary to the public interest ” he wrote. “I therefore dissent.” Mr. Trump fired Mr. Flynn in early 2017 for lying to Vice President Mike Pence and other colleagues about what he and the Russian ambassador discussed in December 2016. After realizing that Mr. Flynn was lying to his colleagues about the calls  the F.B.I. questioned him on Jan. 24  2017  and he again falsely denied what they had discussed. Mr. Flynn later struck a deal with prosecutors working for the special counsel  Robert S. Mueller III  to cooperate and plead guilty to one count of making a false statement to the F.B.I. agents. The deal would resolve his liability for that crime as well as for failing to register as a paid foreign agent of Turkey in 2016 and then signing forms in 2017 lying about the nature of that work. None Among other things  the documents showed that the F.B.I. had decided to close an investigation into whether Mr. Flynn was a Russian agent before the issue of his calls with the Russian ambassador arose  at which point it used the fact that the inquiry remained open to interview him about the new concern. They also showed that James B. Comey  then the F.B.I. director  violated bureaucratic protocol when he unilaterally sent agents to question Mr. Flynn  amid unfinished deliberations with the acting attorney general about how to do it. Ms. Powell used those documents to renew her allegations that law enforcement officials railroaded her client  even as the president indicated that he was considering pardoning Mr. Flynn. But in May  Mr. Barr intervened again  directing a prosecutor to seek to dismiss the case with prejudice — meaning it could not be refiled by the Justice Department under any future administration — on the theory that Mr. Flynn’s lies to the F.B.I. were not “material” to any legitimate investigation. None None The Justice Department and Ms. Powell have rejected that critique  arguing that dismissal of the case was warranted on the facts and that Judge Sullivan had no authority to question the executive branch’s decision not to press forward with a prosecution. Mr. Gleeson had been due to file a response to those rebuttals on Wednesday before Judge Sullivan suspended the proceedings. Katie Benner contributed reporting. Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/politics/roger-stone-sentencing-politicized.html,Roger Stone Sentencing Was Politicized  Prosecutor Plans to Testify Advertisement Supported by The prosecutor’s supervisor said that the case was being treated differently because of the defendant’s relationship with the president  according to planned testimony. None Senior law enforcement officials intervened to seek a more lenient prison sentence for President Trump’s friend and ally Roger J. Stone Jr. for political reasons  a former prosecutor on the case is expected to testify before Congress on Wednesday  citing his supervisor’s account of the matter. “What I heard — repeatedly — was that Roger Stone was being treated differently from any other defendant because of his relationship to the president ” the prosecutor  Aaron S.J. Zelinsky  said in a written opening statement submitted on Tuesday to the House Judiciary Committee ahead of Wednesday’s hearing. A copy was obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Zelinsky is expected to be joined by another current Justice Department employee  John W. Elias  a senior career official in the antitrust division  who will tell the committee that under Attorney General William P. Barr’s leadership  the division was forced for political reasons to pursue unjustified investigations of the fledgling legal marijuana industry and an antipollution pact between California and several automakers. None But at least in the case of Mr. Zelinsky  the secondhand nature of his account of the intervention by Mr. Barr and the acting U.S. attorney in Washington at the time  Timothy Shea  could undercut some of its potential force. And even Democrats concede that with just months left in Mr. Trump’s term  any revelations laid before Congress may have little effect on the fate of Mr. Barr  who has repeatedly and unabashedly defended his actions  or the department. A department spokeswoman said that the attorney general determined that prosecutors’ recommendation for Mr. Stone’s sentence was “excessive and inconsistent with similar cases” and noted that a judge ultimately sentenced Mr. Stone to about half the time — 40 months — that the prosecutors had originally proposed. “Mr. Zelinsky’s allegations concerning the U.S. attorney’s motivation are based on his own interpretation of events and hearsay (at best)  not firsthand knowledge ” said the spokeswoman  Kerri Kupec  adding that Mr. Zelinsky never spoke with any member of the department’s leadership about the case. The intervention in the Stone case is expected to be a major focus of the hearing. Mr. Zelinsky and three fellow career prosecutors recommended to a judge in February that Mr. Stone receive seven to nine years in prison  in line with standard guidelines  for perjury and other crimes related to his sabotaging of a congressional inquiry into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and links to the Trump campaign. Mr. Stone  a longtime confidant of Mr. Trump’s  served as the Trump campaign’s principal intermediary to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign at the time it was publishing information stolen by the Russians and damaging to Hillary Clinton. None Ms. Kupec said that Mr. Barr had not discussed the sentencing request with the president and that he had decided to intervene before Mr. Trump tweeted about it. Mr. Zelinsky will say that a supervisor working on the case told him there were “political reasons” for more senior officials to resist and then override prosecutors’ recommendation to follow the sentencing guidelines and that the supervisor agreed that doing so “was unethical and wrong.”  None The intervention came days after Mr. Barr had maneuvered the Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia  Jessie K. Liu  out of her role and installed Mr. Shea  who had been a close aide from his own office. Mr. Zelinsky planned to say he was told that Mr. Shea “was receiving heavy pressure from the highest levels of the Department of Justice to cut Stone a break” and complied because he was “afraid of the president.” He and other line prosecutors were told that the case was “not the hill worth dying on” and that they could lose their jobs if they did not fall in line  according to the statement. Mr. Zelinsky  a prosecutor in Baltimore  had been detailed to Washington to continue work on the Stone case that was begun while he worked for the special counsel  Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Stone  citing the spread of the coronavirus in federal prisons  asked a federal judge Tuesday for a two-month delay before he is forced to begin serving his sentence  which he was due to report for next week. His motion said that the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington had told his lawyers that based on the department’s guidance about handling pandemic-related issues  the government was not opposed. According to Mr. Elias’s written opening statement  he will accuse the department of inappropriately using its antitrust power to investigate 10 proposed mergers and acquisitions in the marijuana industry because Mr. Barr “did not like the nature of their underlying business.” The reviews consumed a large amount of the antitrust division’s resources  he said  and document demands imposed a heavy burden on the companies  which were forced to produce hundreds of thousands of pages that the department in some cases did not even look at. At least one merger fell through and stock prices dropped as a result  he said  even though there was never a justification in competitiveness analysis — like whether the companies trying to merge would have too much market share — for using antitrust powers to essentially harass the firms. Mr. Elias said that after division staff members expressed concerns  the head of the division  Makan Delrahim  held an all-staff meeting in September and “acknowledged that the investigations were motivated by the fact that the cannabis industry is unpopular ‘on the fifth floor ’ a reference to Attorney General Barr’s offices in the D.O.J. headquarters building.” Mr. Elias added  “Personal dislike of the industry is not a proper basis upon which to ground an antitrust investigation.” Mr. Elias’s statement also portrayed an antitrust review of a deal struck by four major automakers with the State of California to voluntarily continue to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions on new cars  despite the Trump administration’s rollback of federal standards  as politically motivated rather than grounded in the facts and the law. None Asked for a response  another Justice Department official familiar with the inquiry said that it was opened because of news reporting that raised potential antitrust concerns  not because Mr. Trump was angry. Mr. Elias also said the department had all the information it needed to close the investigation without action in November  but “the political leadership” then asked staff members to examine California’s announcement that it would buy only cars that met the standards to keep the inquiry going until February. While the testimony from the two current Justice Department officials about inside deliberation is expected to be the centerpiece of the hearing  the panel will also take testimony from two Republican Justice Department officials from previous administrations — Donald Ayer  who was the deputy attorney general under President George Bush  and Michael Mukasey  who was the attorney general under President George W. Bush. Mr. Ayer has been an outspoken critic of Mr. Barr  whom he served alongside. Republicans on the committee invited Mr. Mukasey. House Democrats have made clear they are also interested in learning more about the firing of the top prosecutor in Manhattan  Geoffrey S. Berman. Mr. Berman initially and publicly resisted Mr. Barr’s pressure to step aside  prompting a furor among Democrats and former Justice Department officials who warned that the White House was trying to force him out because he continued to pursue sensitive cases that irked Mr. Trump. The Judiciary Committee has reached out to Mr. Berman  but he is not expected to appear on Wednesday. Democrats may subpoena Mr. Barr himself as soon as this week to testify  but there is no guarantee he would appear. The attorney general has resisted such appearances in the past and his department has promulgated legal guidance challenging the validity of some past subpoenas from House Democrats  effectively shielding officials from testimony.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/us/politics/mueller-report-redactions-roger-stone.html,Mueller Report Details Highlight Trump’s Interest in Emails Damaging to Clinton Advertisement Supported by The Justice Department had kept the newly revealed information secret while it was investigating Roger Stone and released it in response to a lawsuit. None None None None Many of the disclosures confirmed information already revealed in media reports or in criminal cases against Mr. Trump’s former aides. The public record is replete with accounts of both the Trump campaign’s efforts to use purloined emails against Mrs. Clinton and the president’s attempts to frustrate the special counsel’s inquiry  including by dangling pardons before key witnesses and targets in hopes that they would not cooperate with law enforcement officials. None New details from the Justice Department’s inquiry into Russian influence over the 2016 election released on Friday underscored President Trump’s keen interest in weaponizing information stolen by the Russians and funneled to WikiLeaks for use against his 2016 opponent  Hillary Clinton. Mr. Stone was the Trump campaign’s principal intermediary to WikiLeaks. According to newly released passages  prosecutors suspected that the president feared Mr. Stone might incriminate him. It also shows they doubted Mr. Trump was being truthful when he stated in written answers to their questions that he did not recall ever discussing WikiLeaks with Mr. Stone during the campaign. “It is possible that  by the time the president submitted his written answers two years after the relevant events had occurred  he no longer had clear recollections of his discussions with Stone or his knowledge of Stone’s asserted communications with WikiLeaks ” Mr. Mueller’s investigators wrote in a newly disclosed paragraph. “But the president’s conduct could also be viewed as reflecting his awareness that Stone could provide evidence that would run counter to the president’s denials and would link the president to Stone’s efforts to reach out to WikiLeaks.” The prosecutors wrote that Michael D. Cohen  the president’s former lawyer who was convicted of campaign finance violations and other crimes  told them that he overheard a conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Stone in the candidate’s Trump Tower headquarters in the summer of 2016  before WikiLeaks released its first tranche of Democratic emails stolen by the Russians. Mr. Cohen said that after Mr. Stone promised that WikiLeaks would soon release more damaging information about Mrs. Clinton  Mr. Trump responded  “Oh good  all right.” After WikiLeaks later publicized documents stolen from the Democratic National Committee  Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump told him  “I guess Roger was right ” the report said. The prosecutors also noted that Mr. Trump’s public comments about Mr. Stone and other witnesses and targets were an obvious signal. They “communicate a message that witnesses could be rewarded for refusing to provide testimony adverse to the president and disparaged if they chose to cooperate ” they wrote in a previously redacted sentence. The Justice Department had withheld passages dealing with Mr. Stone in order  it said  to protect the ongoing criminal case against him. But the lawsuit filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center  a watchdog group  and the BuzzFeed News journalist Jason Leopold challenged those and other redactions as violations of the Freedom of Information Act. John Davisson  a lawyer for the privacy group  acknowledged in an interview on Friday night that much of the newly disclosed information “had come out  in one form or another” after the Mueller report was released. But  he said  “the delay  itself is harmful.” He also said he spotted redactions that were unnecessary and raised suspicions about whether law enforcement officials had wrongly withheld other information. The Justice Department’s decision to release more of the text of the report came after the federal judge overseeing that case  Judge Reggie B. Walton of the District of Columbia  expressed suspicion about whether the redactions were justified and ordered government lawyers to provide him with the full report so he could review the redactions himself. The plaintiffs in the case argued there was no reason to withhold any information about Mr. Stone because his criminal case is over. None None Mr. Barr had put forward a “distorted” and “misleading” account of the Mueller report findings in a fashion that downplayed the special counsel’s more damaging findings and shaped the public narrative in the president’s favor  Judge Walton wrote. “These circumstances generally  and Attorney General Barr’s lack of candor specifically  call into question Attorney General Barr’s credibility ” he wrote — and in turn  cast doubt on the department’s statements to him that the redactions were lawful. He said he would privately review the full text because “adherence to the FOIA’s objective of keeping the American public informed of what its government is up to demands nothing less.” During Mr. Stone’s trial  prosecutors said that he obstructed a congressional inquiry into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election in order to protect the president. “He knew that if the truth came out about what he was doing in 2016  it would look terrible ” one prosecutor said of Mr. Stone. The defense team argued that the entire premise of the prosecution’s case was false because Mr. Stone never had any evidence that would have hurt Mr. Trump. He merely tried to discover what information WikiLeaks had obtained that Mr. Trump could use against Mrs. Clinton before the election  they argued  and neither he nor anyone else tied to the campaign ever conspired with the Russians who had funneled that information to WikiLeaks. None Mr. Stone  who is scheduled to report to the Bureau of Prisons by the end of June to start serving his sentence  has expressed hopes that the president will pardon him.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/us/politics/justice-department-michael-flynn.html,Justice Dept. Defends Dropping Flynn Case and Again Asks Judge to Dismiss It Advertisement Supported by Prosecutors rejected a scathing brief that portrayed their reversal in the case as a “gross prosecutorial abuse.” None WASHINGTON — The judge overseeing the prosecution of Michael T. Flynn  President Trump’s former national security adviser  has no authority to reject Attorney General William P. Barr’s decision to drop the case  the Justice Department argued on Wednesday. None “Even if a court believes that a refusal to prosecute rests on an improper motive or amounts to a ‘gross abuse ’ it would lack any practical mechanism for forcing the executive to prosecute a case against its will ” prosecutors wrote. They called their motion to dismiss the charge “an unreviewable exercise of prosecutorial discretion.” The brief also reiterated the Justice Department’s central argument from its motion to drop the case — that Mr. Flynn’s lies to the F.B.I. in January 2017 about his calls with the Russian ambassador the previous month were not “material” to any legitimate investigation. But it shifted greater emphasis to portraying as suspicious some actions by the agents investigating Mr. Flynn. The filing is the latest turn in the politically charged case as Judge Sullivan considers whether to side with the department and dismiss the case — and  if he does  whether to do so in a way that would prevent future prosecutors from refiling charges against Mr. Flynn or to leave open that possibility — or instead to deny the department’s motion and proceed to sentencing Mr. Flynn. None Judge Sullivan appointed John Gleeson  a former mafia prosecutor and retired judge  to critique the government’s arguments. Mr. Gleeson filed a scathing brief last week contending that prosecutors’ rationale made no sense and must be cover for a corrupt and politically motivated decision. He recommended instead sentencing Mr. Flynn. None In the meantime  the case against Mr. Flynn has proceeded before Judge Sullivan. Wednesday was the deadline for the government and Ms. Powell to file briefs responding to Mr. Gleeson. The central justification of the department’s motion to dismiss the case was its claim that Mr. Flynn’s lies were immaterial to any legitimate investigation. It emphasized that the F.B.I. had been about to close an inquiry into whether Mr. Flynn was himself a Russian agent  but then used that inquiry to question him about his calls with the ambassador. Mr. Gleeson had ridiculed that rationale. Among other things  he said  Mr. Flynn’s talks with the ambassador — and his subsequent lies about them to colleagues like Vice President Mike Pence — were obviously material to the larger Trump-Russia investigation  and he noted that the F.B.I. did not need an open preliminary or full investigation to conduct a voluntary interview anyway. The new Justice Department brief was silent about several such holes that Mr. Gleeson poked in its materiality theory. Prosecutors instead told Judge Sullivan that he had no right to inquire about internal Justice Department deliberations to “look beyond the government’s stated reasons in this case to a determination of whether the court believes those reasons were mistaken.” None Prosecutors had already disclosed to Mr. Flynn  before he pleaded guilty  some of the behavior the brief recounted anew — such as that one of the agents who interviewed him  Peter Strzok  had sent messages showing he did not like Mr. Trump’s election  and that he and his colleague said after the interview that they had not seen physical indications that Mr. Flynn was lying. (In his brief  Mr. Gleeson had noted that Mr. Flynn’s supporters were inconsistent about Mr. Strzok — both suggesting that he sought to entrap Mr. Flynn and yet emphasizing that he had let it be known that he was not sure whether Mr. Flynn had lied based on his mannerisms.) Other documents became public more recently  after Mr. Barr opened a review of the case file for additional material to turn over to Ms. Powell. These included that James B. Comey  the F.B.I. director at the time  angered Justice Department officials by unilaterally sending agents to question Mr. Flynn  short-circuiting deliberations among law enforcement officials over whether to tell the White House counsel. In addition  a senior F.B.I. official had taken notes for a meeting about the Flynn interview musing about whether the goal was to get Mr. Flynn to tell the truth or to get him to lie so he could be fired or prosecuted. The brief’s greater emphasis on portraying F.B.I. actions negatively dovetailed with arguments Ms. Powell has made claiming prosecutorial misconduct  including by failing to turn over some of those documents earlier. But a footnote in the department brief rejected her accusation  saying  “Flynn’s allegations are unfounded and provide no basis for impugning the prosecutors from the D.C. United States attorney’s office.” Still  the new government brief tried to cast a cloud over not just Mr. Strzok but the other agent who interviewed Mr. Flynn  Joe Pientka. Prosecutors questioned whether a jury would trust them since the interview with Mr. Flynn was not recorded and several of the things in their report about the interview were not reflected in the notes they jotted down while talking to him. “While such discrepancies would not always be significant  given the other evidence and substantial impeaching materials on the key witnesses  it posed another reason to doubt the government’s ability to make out its case beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury in the circumstances of this case ” prosecutors wrote. Last year  however  Judge Sullivan ruled that the documents were “both consistent and clear that Mr. Flynn made false statements to the F.B.I.” The judge also said that Mr. Flynn’s lies were material.

None None House Democrats issued subpoenas on Tuesday to the prosecutor  Aaron S.J. Zelinsky  along with a second Justice Department official  John W. Elias  who has also agreed to testify in public on June 24 about politicization under Attorney General William P. Barr — setting up a potential fight with the department about what they will be permitted to say. None None The chairman of the Judiciary Committee  Representative Jerrold Nadler  Democrat of New York  said in a statement that Mr. Barr has refused to testify himself  so the committee was moving forward with oversight of his actions without him. “The attorney general — who cites his busy schedule as a basis for refusing to appear before the House Judiciary Committee but has made time for multiple television interviews — may have abdicated his responsibility to Congress  but the brave men and women of our civil service have not ” Mr. Nadler said. “The committee welcomes the testimony of current and former department officials who will speak to the lasting damage the president and the attorney general have inflicted on the Department of Justice.” Kerri Kupec  a Justice Department spokeswoman  declined to comment. The ability of lower-level officials to testify about internal executive branch matters without permission can be subject to dispute. The executive branch sometimes claims that such matters are privileged. Still  it has limited ability to block officials who have been subpoenaed by Congress and who want to comply with those legal demands to testify. A third expected witness at the June 24 hearing is Donald Ayer  who served as deputy attorney general in the first George Bush administration when Mr. Barr led the department’s Office of Legal Counsel in 1989 and 1990  before Mr. Barr succeeded him as deputy attorney general and then ascended to his first stint as attorney general. None Republicans on the Judiciary Committee can invite a witness of their own but have not selected one  according to a committee aide. Mr. Zelinsky  an assistant United States attorney in Maryland  had been a member of the office of Robert S. Mueller III  the special counsel appointed to lead the investigation into whether Trump campaign officials coordinated with the Russian government in its 2016 election interference operation. He continued to handle the case against Mr. Stone  which spun off that inquiry. None None None Robert S. Litt  a former general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  who is representing Mr. Zelinsky  said his client “has received a subpoena and he will comply with the subpoena to the extent appropriate.” He declined to say what Mr. Zelinsky would discuss. A Democratic aide said that Mr. Zelinsky would testify about what happened in the sentencing of Mr. Stone and that Mr. Elias would testify about purportedly improperly motivated activity by the Antitrust Division. The aide provided no further details about Mr. Elias’s expected disclosures. But Mr. Elias’s service in the Antitrust Division coincides with an inquiry into a deal struck by four major automakers with the State of California. Under the deal  Ford  Honda  Volkswagen and BMW would voluntarily continue to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions on new cars  despite the Trump administration’s rollback of federal standards.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/politics/michael-flynn-appeals-court.html,Court Seems Open to Allowing Judge to Scrutinize Bid to Drop Flynn Case Advertisement Supported by An appeals court panel’s questions suggested that it is unlikely to block a lower-court judge from examining why prosecutors asked to dismiss the case against a Trump ally who already pleaded guilty. None WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court panel appeared inclined on Friday to permit a trial judge to complete his review of the Justice Department’s attempt to drop a criminal case against President Trump’s former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn  as all three judges asked skeptical questions about a request that they intervene and order the case dismissed. None None None Last month  on the same day that Judge Sullivan appointed Mr. Gleeson to critique the Justice Department’s new position about the case  Mr. Flynn’s defense lawyer  Sidney Powell  asked the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to issue a so-called writ of mandamus that would order Judge Sullivan to immediately end the case. None Judge Robert L. Wilkins  a 2014 appointee of President Barack Obama  stressed that the federal rule of criminal procedure under which the Justice Department asked Judge Sullivan to dismiss the case says prosecutors may make such a request “with leave of the court ” meaning the judge’s approval. He asked how those words could mean anything if judges had to rubber-stamp requests without review. Judge Karen L. Henderson  a 1990 appointee of President George Bush  repeatedly said Judge Sullivan might disagree with Mr. Gleeson’s view and dismiss the case. She suggested that “regular order” would be to let that process play out  noting that Ms. Powell and the Justice Department could come back to the appeals court if Judge Sullivan decided instead to sentence Mr. Flynn. And Judge Neomi Rao  a 2019 appointee of Mr. Trump  pointed out that one of Ms. Powell’s arguments conflicted with Supreme Court precedent. She also asked a Justice Department lawyer whether he could come up with a more concrete reason for why letting Judge Sullivan’s review play out would harm the executive branch — noting that mandamus orders are supposed to be extraordinary and abstract notions of harms are most likely insufficient. The skepticism of Judges Henderson and Rao was particularly notable because both have been more willing than most colleagues to interpret the law in ways more favorable to the Trump administration in other politically charged cases like fights over congressional access to information the executive branch wants to keep secret. Their random assignment to the panel had seemed to increase the possibility that Mr. Flynn might prevail even though many legal experts agreed that Ms. Powell’s request for immediate intervention by the appeals court at this stage was questionable. But all three judges on Friday seemed to share the view that Judge Sullivan had the power to hold a hearing. If so  that will be bad news for the Justice Department  argued the deputy solicitor general  Jeffrey Wall. He called Mr. Gleeson’s brief attacking Mr. Barr’s decision to end the case a “polemic ” but said it would harm the executive branch to have to defend itself against it. The department is likely to have to provide information about its internal deliberations — including why no career prosecutor signed the motion to dismiss the charge against Mr. Flynn — in the spectacle of a “politicized” atmosphere  Mr. Wall said. “There are real harms here and if we know what has to happen at the end of the day  with all respect  district court should be directed to do it now rather than have some unnecessary and very harmful proceedings ” he said. The arguments on Friday left unanswered what would happen if Judge Sullivan were to reject the Justice Department’s motion to dismiss the case. Ms. Wilkinson took no position on whether a judge could sentence a defendant who had pleaded guilty even though the executive branch no longer wanted to pursue the case. But Judge Henderson suggested that she took a skeptical view of Mr. Gleeson’s brief  saying that Judge Sullivan may have chosen an “intemperate” person to critique the Justice Department’s move. For all anyone knows  she added  the judge may say next month that Mr. Gleeson’s brief is “over the top” and grant the dismissal motion. While previously represented by a different defense lawyer  Mr. Flynn had agreed to cooperate and pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. The deal resolved his liability for both his false statements to the F.B.I. and for failing to register as a paid foreign agent of Turkey and then lying about that work in belated registration forms. But he switched defense representation to Ms. Powell and  in January  recanted his admission and sought to withdraw his plea. In the interim  Mr. Trump and his allies have made the case against Mr. Flynn a political cause by portraying him as a victim of F.B.I. and prosecutorial misconduct. The attacks are part of the larger effort to discredit the investigation into whether Trump campaign associates coordinated activities with the Russian government during its covert operation in 2016 to tilt the election in Mr. Trump’s favor. Mr. Trump had said he was considering pardoning his former aide before Mr. Barr’s intervention. None None None Adam Goldman and Katie Benner contributed reporting. Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/us/politics/republicans-subpoena-russia-inquiry.html,Republicans Secure More Subpoena Power in Push to Discredit Russia Inquiry Advertisement Supported by Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee authorized their chairman to subpoena dozens of F.B.I. and former Obama administration officials  including a top aide to Joseph R. Biden Jr. None Senate Republicans plunged forward on Thursday with an election-year bid to discredit the Trump-Russia investigation  voting to give themselves expansive authority to subpoena dozens of national security aides and several high-ranking Obama administration officials  including a top campaign adviser to President Trump’s Democratic challenger  Joseph R. Biden Jr. The party-line vote by the Judiciary Committee was the second time in a week that a Republican-led panel has moved to expand its reach by granting its chairman the power to unilaterally compel documents and testimony related to the Russia matter. In both cases  Republicans are seeking to tarnish the investigators and to recast Mr. Trump and his campaign not as beneficiaries of Russian assistance in 2016  but as victims of dangerous overreach by a Democratic administration and law enforcement officials. “We need to look long and hard at how the Mueller investigation got off the rails ” Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina and the Judiciary Committee chairman  said before the vote  referring to the special counsel who led the inquiry  Robert S. Mueller III. “This committee is not going to sit on the sidelines and move on.” None Mr. Graham plans to hold public hearings in the weeks ahead not only highlighting errors and omissions by investigators that have already been uncovered by a Justice Department inspector general  but also building a broader case to the public that some investigators criminally abused their authorities. The inspector general  by comparison  said he found no reason to question the outcome of the special counsel’s investigation. None Democrats roundly opposed the subpoenas on Thursday  accusing Republicans of using the committee as a tool of electoral politics. “Never has a chairman devoted the full weight of this committee’s resources to pursue a wholly partisan investigation after being prompted by a presidential campaign ” said Patrick J. Leahy  Democrat of Vermont and a former chairman of the panel. He also noted that it was unusual for a Senate chairman to move so directly to use subpoenas  rather than try to secure voluntary cooperation first. None “Our country is facing three crises: A health pandemic  an economic catastrophe and systemic racism and police violence ” said Senator Mazie K. Hirono  Democrat of Hawaii. “But rather than doing something concrete about these crises  this committee is asking for blanket subpoena authority to go over ground that has already been covered.” None Each failed on party lines. None But Mr. Graham grew agitated at Democrats’ pointed critiques of his work  and reminded them that as the minority  they had no power to prevent him from moving forward. “You are trying to stop me from doing something I think the country needs to do  and I am not going to be stopped ” he declared.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/politics/memo-russian-bounties.html,New Administration Memo Seeks to Foster Doubts About Suspected Russian Bounties Advertisement Supported by Criticized for its inaction  the Trump administration commissioned a new look at a months-old intelligence assessment. It emphasizes gaps. None A memo produced in recent days by the office of the nation’s top intelligence official acknowledged that the C.I.A. and top counterterrorism officials have assessed that Russia appears to have offered bounties to kill American and coalition troops in Afghanistan  but emphasized uncertainties and gaps in evidence  according to three officials. The memo is said to contain no new information  and both its timing and its stressing of doubts suggested that it was intended to bolster the Trump administration’s attempts to justify its inaction on the months-old assessment  the officials said. Some former national security officials said the account of the memo indicated that politics may have influenced its production. None None But other parts of the intelligence community — including the National Security Agency  which favors electronic surveillance intelligence — said they did not have information to support that conclusion at the same level  therefore expressing lower confidence in the conclusion  according to the two officials. A third official familiar with the memo did not describe the precise confidence levels  but also said the C.I.A.’s was higher than other agencies. A spokeswoman for Mr. Ratcliffe’s office declined to comment. The officials familiar with the memo described it on the condition of anonymity. None “I would hope the process still maintains its integrity  but I have real concerns  given the pressures these analysts are under ” Mr. Treverton said in a telephone interview. None “These products are never definitive  ever — there’s always caveats and holes and judgments and qualifications ” Mr. Olsen said. “The White House has portrayed it as not verified  but it’s never verified  so that struck me as misrepresentation. It would be very easy  if you want to take a different spin  to draw those out and amplify the ways it’s inconclusive.” Mr. Ratcliffe  formerly a Republican congressman known for his outspoken support for Mr. Trump  was confirmed in late May. The memo is said to lay out the intelligence that informed the agencies’ conclusions. It declared that the intelligence community knows that Russian military intelligence officers met with leaders of a Taliban-linked criminal network and that money was transferred from a G.R.U. account to the network. After lower-level members of that network were captured  they told interrogators that the Russians were paying bounties to encourage the killings of coalition troops  including Americans. But  the two officials who discussed the memo in greater detail said  it stressed that the government lacks direct evidence of what the criminal network leaders and G.R.U. officials said at face-to-face meetings so it cannot say with any greater certainty that Russia specifically offered bounties in return for killings of Western soldiers. None The memo also emphasized that the National Security Agency did not have surveillance that confirmed what the captured detainees told interrogators about bounties  according to the officials. The agency did intercept data of financial transfers that provide circumstantial support for the detainees’ account  but the agency does not have explicit evidence that the money was bounty payments. None The memo was produced as the administration  in response to bipartisan congressional demands  delivered briefings to lawmakers this week. Another person familiar with one of the briefings said that lawmakers were told that the intelligence community had high confidence that Russia was encouraging Taliban attacks on American and coalition forces and that the G.R.U. had officers in Afghanistan with links to the Taliban. But  the person said  while there was chatter among Afghans about possible bounties for attacks  American officials were less sure when it came to trying to link Russians to the acts of specific Taliban militants or associated criminal units  or showing that the Russians had actually paid for specific attacks. At one point  about half a million dollars in cash was seized in a raid on a compound  raising suspicions  but investigators could not say for sure that it was bounty money. The briefers told Congress that it was not clear whether the Russians were behind or paid for one episode that investigators are said to be focused on: the killing of three Marines in an April 2019 bombing outside Bagram Air Base. One official said the new memo said that it cannot be established with certainty that Russian actions led to that attack. The United States has accused Russia of providing support like small arms to the Taliban for years. After interagency vetting  the intelligence assessment that Russia’s support had escalated into directly encouraging more attacks on Americans and other coalition troops was included in Mr. Trump’s written daily brief in late February  officials have said. Mr. Trump is known to only rarely read his daily briefing  however. Administration officials have said publicly that he was not “briefed” but remained coy about whether the assessment was in his written brief. In congressional briefings  according to participants  administration officials have stressed that Mr. Trump was not “orally” briefed. The assessment of the problem also served as the basis of an interagency meeting in late March convened by the National Security Council  at the end of which officials were assigned to come up with a menu of potential responses. The ensuing list started with making a diplomatic complaint to Russia and escalated into sanctions and other punishments  officials have said. But despite receiving that list months ago  the Trump White House has not authorized action. The administration appeared to have indefinitely sidelined the issue  the officials said  until The Times article last week caused an uproar in Congress  prompting a fresh look at it.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/politics/trump-afghanistan-russia-bounty.html,Bounties Uproar Casts a Shadow Over a Rare Trump Foreign Policy Achievement Advertisement Supported by White house memo The president was already impatient to end a troop deployment in Afghanistan he has called “ridiculous.” Now a new issue is causing him fresh political damage. None None His nuclear talks with North Korea have proved fruitless  his “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran has produced no concessions from Tehran  Palestinians declared his Middle East peace plan dead on arrival  and a trade deal with China looks more unlikely every day. None None None But with the November election coming  military officials say they are braced for Mr. Trump to announce at any time his intention to pull thousands more troops from the country before then. One person familiar with the president’s thinking said he had repeatedly spoken of having all American soldiers out of the country by the end of the year. That prospect may become even more likely now that the United States’ continuing presence in Afghanistan has badly stung a president who lost patience with the American mission there long ago  but for years has found himself pressured to stay by congressional and military leaders invoking the specter of another attack in the mold of Sept. 11. The debate over what Trump officials knew about the intelligence on Russian bounties and when is “ignoring the bigger picture here ” said Dan Caldwell  senior adviser of Concerned Veterans for America  a conservative group that opposes American troop deployments overseas. “The bigger problem ” he added  “is that by leaving our troops not only in places like Afghanistan but also in Iraq and Syria  we make it easier for our adversaries like Russia  Iran and nonstate actors like Al Qaeda to bleed us on the cheap.” None None The recently published book by Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser John R. Bolton confirms what has become increasingly obvious. Mr. Bolton recounts numerous instances when Mr. Trump  making liberal use of expletives  asked his exasperated advisers when he could be finished with the country. “We’ve got to get out of there ” Mr. Bolton recalls Mr. Trump saying in March 2019. Mr. Trump took a key step in that direction on Feb. 29  when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a Taliban leader signed an agreement in Qatar under which the U.S. would begin a phased troop withdrawal in exchange for a halt in Taliban attacks on American forces and the beginning of political talks between the insurgent group and the Afghan government. None That agreement has been plagued with setbacks  including an unwelcome increase in Taliban attacks on Afghan targets  an exchange of prisoners between the Taliban and the Afghan government that has taken months longer than expected  and an Afghan election with disputed results that paralyzed the country’s government. In one sign that Mr. Trump is determined to press ahead  Mr. Pompeo spoke by video conference on Monday with the Taliban’s deputy and chief negotiator  Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar  “to discuss implementation of the U.S.-Taliban agreement ” according to a State Department spokeswoman. “The secretary made clear the expectation for the Taliban to live up to their commitments  which include not attacking Americans ” added the spokeswoman  Morgan Ortagus. (There is no indication that U.S. intelligence has tied Russian bounties to any attacks on Americans since the agreement was signed  or that the Taliban’s senior leadership was aware of them.) None “Certainly there’s a political resonance for the notion that  after all these years  President Trump will end the war that other presidents were unwilling to end ” said Richard Fontaine  the chief executive officer of the Center for a New American Security  a Washington-based policy group. Mr. Fontaine cautions against a withdrawal of troops  reminiscent of the American exit from Iraq in 2011  that could allow militants to rampage and terrorists to find safe haven as Al Qaeda did in Afghanistan before the Sept. 11 attacks. For now  that view has significant support in Congress. On Wednesday  the House Armed Services Committee voted 45 to 11 to approve a bipartisan amendment to an annual defense authorization bill that would restrict funds for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan below the level of 8 000. One of the amendment’s co-sponsors  Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming  the third-ranking House Republican  warned in a statement that “the U.S.-Taliban deal allows for premature troop withdrawal that is not conditions-based.” A Senate effort from the opposite perspective met a swift rebuke the same day. Senator Rand Paul  a Kentucky Republican and one of Congress’s leading noninterventionist voices  co-sponsored an amendment with Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico  a Democrat  to withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan within a year. The Senate voted 60 to 33 to table the amendment. Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting. Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/supreme-court-mueller-report.html,Supreme Court to Hear Case on Release of Full Mueller Report Advertisement Supported by The move almost certainly means that blacked-out passages requested by Congress will stay secret at least until after the presidential election. None None None The court will probably hear arguments in the case in the late fall  after the election  and issue its decision next year. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  expressed frustration about the delay the court’s review required. “I am disappointed by the court’s decision to prolong this case further  but I am confident we will prevail ” he said in a statement. Attorney General William P. Barr  he said  had broken with the practices of earlier administrations by refusing to allow access to grand jury materials in impeachment inquiries. “Unfortunately ” Mr. Nadler said  “President Trump and Attorney General Barr are continuing to try to run out the clock on any and all accountability.” The case arose from a request by the House Judiciary Committee for grand jury materials that the Justice Department had blacked out from the report provided to Congress. None None None “The committee’s impeachment investigation related to obstruction of justice pertaining to the Russia investigation is ongoing ” the brief said. None “The committee’s investigation continues today and has further developed in light of recent events ” the House’s brief said. “For example  the committee is investigating the possible exercise of improper political influence over recent decisions made in the Roger Stone and Michael Flynn prosecutions  both of which were initiated by the special counsel.” None The panel was divided on other issues in the case  but it agreed that an impeachment trial was a “judicial proceeding” for purposes of the rule. Historical practice supported the ruling  Judge Judith W. Rogers wrote for the majority. “Federal courts have authorized the disclosure of grand jury materials to the House for use in impeachment investigations involving two presidents and three federal judges ” Judge Rogers wrote. “It is only the president’s categorical resistance and the department’s objection that is unprecedented.” None Lawyers for the House said that order was part of an unbroken series of precedents. “To our knowledge ” they said  “no court has ever turned down a request for grand jury materials by Congress in connection with an impeachment.” None One of Mr. Trump’s lawyers at the impeachment trial  Ken Starr  made the same point  the brief said. “We are not a legislative chamber during these proceedings ” Mr. Starr said. “We are in court.” None He said the appeals court’s “historical examples” were “of questionable probative value because in each instance D.O.J. supported disclosure of the requested materials.” The Justice Department  he wrote  “has reconsidered that position.” Lawyers for the House urged the justices to reject the department’s new position in the case  Department of Justice v. House Committee on the Judiciary  No. 19-1328. “The decision below ” the House’s brief said  “was plainly correct to reject the newly developed position that D.O.J. has advocated here  after decades of taking the opposite view that Congress can indeed legally obtain grand jury materials in connection with impeachment proceedings.” The House brief said the grand jury materials would be kept confidential under protocols established by the committee. “These protocols  which are similar to those used to protect grand jury and other confidential materials during the Nixon impeachment investigation  limit staff access to grand jury material  require storage of such material in a secure location  and provide that such material may not be publicly disclosed absent a majority vote by the committee ” the brief said. Mr. Francisco called those protocols inadequate. “Once the government discloses the secret grand jury records  their secrecy will irrevocably be lost ” he wrote. “That is particularly so when  as here  they are disclosed to a congressional committee and its staff. Indeed  as respondent acknowledged below  its own procedures will allow it to release these grand jury materials to the public by a simple majority vote of the committee (not even the full House).” Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/politics/mary-trump-book-lawsuit.html,Tell-All Book on Trump Can Move Forward Pending Hearing  Judge Rules Advertisement Supported by The decision reversed a lower court’s ruling that had temporarily halted publication of the book by the president’s niece  but it didn’t address whether she violated a confidentiality agreement. None None None Justice Scheinkman’s ruling  however  put off addressing a central aspect of the bitter spat about the manuscript that has been roiling all month in the Trump family: whether  by writing the book  Ms. Trump violated a confidentiality agreement put in place nearly 20 years ago after a struggle over the will of her grandfather  Fred Trump Sr.  Donald Trump’s father. In his decision  Justice Scheinkman ruled that Simon & Schuster was not a party to — and thus could not be bound by — the confidentiality agreement  which was signed by Ms. Trump  Donald Trump and the president’s two siblings  Robert S. Trump and Maryanne Trump Barry. “Unlike Ms. Trump ” Justice Scheinkman wrote  “S&S has not agreed to surrender or relinquish any of its First Amendment rights.” Simon & Schuster quickly hailed the ruling as a victory. “We support Mary L. Trump’s right to tell her story in ‘Too Much and Never Enough ’ a work of great interest and importance to the national discourse that fully deserves to be published for the benefit of the American public ” the publisher said in a statement issued Wednesday night. “As all know  there are well-established precedents against prior restraint and pre-publication injunctions.” None While Justice Scheinkman declined on Wednesday to rule on the question of whether Ms. Trump had violated the agreement  he did note that it was “reasonable for a well-known and prominent family to collectively agree” to shield “intimate family matters” from the public. But he also pointed out that an agreement reached two decades ago to protect the Trump family’s privacy may have been altered by the fact that Donald Trump had in the interim become the president. “The legitimate interest in preserving family secrets may be one thing for the family of a real estate developer  no matter how successful ” Justice Scheinkman wrote. “It is another matter for the family of the president of the United States.” Justice Scheinkman said he might have to review the book himself to decide if its contents violated the confidentiality agreement. Theodore J. Boutrous Jr.  a lawyer for Ms. Trump  said on Wednesday that he planned to file a formal appeal of the lower court’s ruling on Thursday. “It is very good news that the prior restraint against Simon & Schuster has been vacated ” Mr. Boutrous said  “and we look forward to filing our brief tomorrow in the trial court explaining why the same result is required as to Ms. Trump  based on the First Amendment and basic contract law.” Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/politics/trump-russia-bounties-taliban.html,White House Dismisses Reports of Bounties  but Is Silent on Russia Advertisement Supported by Robert C. O’Brien  the national security adviser  told Fox News that President Trump knew nothing about the reports because the briefer “decided not to” share unverified intelligence with him. None None None None None None “The president was not briefed  because at the time of these allegations  they were uncorroborated ” Mr. O’Brien said. “And as a result  the president’s career C.I.A. briefer decided not to brief him.” The administration has not publicly acknowledged that the information was provided to Mr. Trump in his written briefing  and has not responded to questions about whether they were saying he simply chose not to read it. But it would be unusual  if not unprecedented  for intelligence with grave implications to be withheld from the president on the grounds that it lacked definitive consensus. Former Obama administration officials have said that even the intelligence that formed the basis of the May 2011 raid in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden was inconclusive and disputed among national security officials. Mr. O’Brien did not name the C.I.A. briefer but said she was “an outstanding officer.” He added  “I certainly support her decision.” None None But in that case  there were many other warnings Mr. Trump ignored from both government officials and health experts  as well as former officials speaking publicly and reports in the news media. Former officials say that unlike his predecessors  Mr. Trump often does not read the President’s Daily Brief  the summary prepared for him by the intelligence agencies. And he registers only information relayed to him orally  a fact that administration officials acknowledged when meeting with lawmakers this week. Even then  officials have said  Mr. Trump is often unfocused and easily distracted during his briefing. Ms. Sanner  who began briefing the president last year  has acquired a reputation for effectively presenting information to Mr. Trump in ways that engage him. None Mr. O’Brien said that public disclosure of the matter by leakers would make it more difficult to “get to the bottom” of the reports. He added that the C.I.A. had filed a criminal report with the Department of Justice. Mr. Trump responded vaguely when asked in an interview on Wednesday with the Fox Business Network about how he would respond if Russia were proven to have put bounties on U.S. troops. “The Russians would hear about it  and anybody else would hear about it that was involved ” he said  insisting that he would always protect the military. Mr. O’Brien told reporters that the National Security Council had drawn up undisclosed options for a potential response. He was among several senior Trump officials at a White House briefing on Tuesday for House Democrats  which lawmakers complained was hampered by the absence of any intelligence professionals who could walk them through the nuances of the competing strands of intelligence. “They just wanted to make sure that we knew that the president didn’t know anything ” said Representative Adam Smith  Democrat of Washington and the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee  who attended the meeting. “I cannot recall under Bush  Obama  Clinton  them wanting to come out and say  ‘Look  the president didn’t know anything.’” Mark Meadows  the White House chief of staff  did most of the talking in the nearly two-hour session. But Mr. Meadows  a former North Carolina congressman  did not seem to understand the nuances of intelligence and so could not clearly explain some of the more complicated issues that lawmakers raised  according to people briefed on the meeting. The director of national intelligence  John Ratcliffe  repeatedly told lawmakers the events in question happened well before he took over his post in late May from the former acting director  Richard Grenell. The lawmakers  including Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia  a former C.I.A. officer  pushed back and asked why  after the assessment was included in the President’s Daily Brief in late February  Mr. Trump was not given a heads-up before any of the five or six phone calls he subsequently had with Mr. Putin  including one call in which Mr. Trump invited the Russian leader to a Group of 7 meeting. Sticking to talking points  White House officials acknowledged that the C.I.A. had concluded that a Russian bounty plot existed  but did not explain in detail the supporting evidence behind the assessment. That evidence  The Times has reported  included detainee interrogations  the recovery of about $500 000 from a Taliban-related target and intercepts of electronic communications showing financial transfers between the Russian military intelligence unit and Afghan intermediaries. Instead  the White House officials focused on skepticism from the National Security Agency  which assessed that it did not have information to corroborate the C.I.A.’s conclusion.  But the House Democrats were not briefed in detail on the intercepts of the electronic communications showing the financial transfers  which other U.S. officials say have reconciled many of the differences between the C.I.A. and National Security Agency assessments. They received no explanation for why the material was not addressed. A member of Congress familiar with the intelligence file said that it did not address when or how Mr. Trump was briefed on the material. Nor did it detail any connection to specific U.S. or coalition deaths in Afghanistan. The lawmaker said that gaps remained in the intelligence community’s understanding of the overall program  including its precise motive  which officials have speculated could range from revenge to forcing the United States out of Afghanistan more quickly. None While many Republicans rushed to defend Mr. Trump’s handling of the matter  some called for more focus on Russia’s threat to American interests. “I’m interested in hearing the administration speak clearly about their plans that aren’t just hypothetical sanctions sometime out in the future ” said Senator Ben Sasse  Republican of Nebraska.  Senator Tammy Duckworth  Democrat of Illinois  said a briefing for Senate Armed Services Committee members had little value because the Pentagon had sent officials who lacked detailed knowledge. For example  she said  the briefers had not even seen all of the documents in the intelligence file  which senators had separately been able to read  and did not know whether any casualties in Afghanistan were now being studied as possible bounty killings. The Times has reported that investigators are said to be focused on at least two attacks on American troops in Afghanistan  including one bombing and a firefight in April 2019 near Bagram Air Base that killed three Marines. “It really didn’t answer the questions we had ” Ms. Duckworth said. With lawmakers in both parties asking for more information  Gina Haspel  the C.I.A. director  and Gen. Paul M. Nakasone  the head of the National Security Agency  along with Mr. Ratcliffe  were scheduled to deliver on Thursday the highest-level briefing yet about the American intelligence to a select group of bipartisan House and Senate leaders  known as the Gang of Eight. Asked on Wednesday about the Russian bounties  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said U.S. intelligence officials “handled this incredibly well” to minimize risk to American troops in Afghanistan. He also said that it would be “nothing new” if Russia undermined American in Afghanistan  noting that the Taliban had long received funding from foreign nations  including Russia and Iran. Mr. Pompeo refused to directly address whether Mr. Trump should have been told about intelligence indicating the Russian bounty offers. During a visit to Arizona on Wednesday  Vice President Mike Pence demurred when asked about the matter. ”I was never briefed about that matter ” he said  “and I’m not going to discuss classified materials.” Nicholas Fandos  Adam Goldman  Lara Jakes and Charlie Savage contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/politics/trump-asylum-ruling-immigration.html,Federal Judge Strikes Down Trump Administration’s Asylum Rule Advertisement Supported by A federal judge has ruled that a regulation that effectively barred many asylum seekers from obtaining protection in the United States violated federal law. It is the latest in a string of defeats. None WASHINGTON — A federal judge appointed by President Trump has ruled that the Trump administration must end a policy that effectively bars most Central American migrants fleeing poverty and persecution from obtaining asylum in the United States. None None None The same factors may have cost the president his hard-fought rule to block asylum seekers. “It’s notable in this case that Judge Kelly reiterated what other judges recently retorted to the administration: Do your homework ” said Claudia Cubas  the litigation director for the Capital Area Immigrants’ Rights Coalition  one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The Justice and Homeland Security Departments did not respond to requests for comment. None None None “Should the border ever reopen  the government could simply use the asylum cooperative agreements to turn away everyone anyway ” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick  the policy counsel for the American Immigration Council  an immigrant advocacy organization. “Of course  it is extraordinarily unlikely the Trump administration will lift the ban at the border through his first term in office.” But immigration lawyers said the decision issued Tuesday would create some opportunities for migrants  including children  who had sought asylum in the United States after the rule was issued last July  including many who were forced to wait in Mexico while their hearings were delayed. With the rule in place  their asylum claims could have been rejected by a judge if they had not previously applied for asylum in another country en route. Now many of those migrants may be able to secure asylum in court. “They will finally get a chance at asylum  something they should’ve got from the first get-go ” Ms. Cubas said. The administration had moved forward with the policy after the Supreme Court in September lifted an injunction against it  allowing it to be enforced while the legal fights played out in the courts. None Once the stay was lifted  advocacy groups in the Washington case bolstered their filings by adding women and children who had fled persecution and violence in Central America  Cuba and Angola but had not applied for asylum before reaching the U.S. border. On Tuesday  Judge Kelly found that the administration’s excuse for not allowing the public to weigh in on the rule was not justified. “After carefully examining the record  the court finds that it does not contain sufficient evidence ” Judge Kelly wrote. Immigration lawyers were elated. “We are thrilled that Judge Kelly has held the administration accountable for failing to follow longstanding procedural rules as it tries to eviscerate the asylum system ” said Keren Zwick  the director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center. “The rule had a devastating impact on asylum seekers  and we are glad to see Judge Kelly clearly state that this administration is not above the law even as it tries to villainize refugees.” Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/politics/trump-putin-russia-taliban-bounty.html,Trump’s New Russia Problem: Unread Intelligence and Missing Strategy Advertisement Supported by News Analysis High-level clearance is not required to see that the list of Russian aggressions in recent weeks rivals some of the worst days of the Cold War. None None None The White House says it was not even appropriate for him to be briefed because the president only sees “verified” intelligence — prompting derision from officials who have spent years working on the daily brief and say it is most valuable when filled with dissenting interpretations and alternative explanations. None But it doesn’t require a top-secret clearance and access to the government’s most classified information to see that the list of Russian aggressions in recent weeks rivals some of the worst days of the Cold War. None It is all part of what Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  said on Monday was “the latest in a series of escalations from Putin’s regime.” Yet missing from all this is a strategy for pushing back — old-fashioned deterrence  to pluck a phrase from the depths of the Cold War — that could be employed from Afghanistan to Ukraine  from the deserts of Libya to the vulnerable voter registration rolls in battleground states. Officially  in Mr. Trump’s national security strategy  Russia is described as a “revisionist power” whose efforts to peel away NATO allies and push the United States out of the Middle East have to be countered. But the paper strategy differs significantly from the reality. There are at least two Russia strategies in this divided administration. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  usually so attuned to Mr. Trump  speaks for the hawkish wing: He came to the State Department podium a few weeks ago to declare that Crimea  annexed by Russia six years ago  will never be recognized as Russian territory. None Yet the nature of intelligence — always incomplete and not always definitive — gives Mr. Trump an opening to dismiss anything that challenges his worldview. “By definition  intelligence means looking at pieces of a puzzle ” said Glenn S. Gerstell  who retired this year as the general counsel of the National Security Agency  before the Russian bounty issue was front and center. “It’s not unusual to have inconsistencies. And the President’s Daily Brief  not infrequently  would say that there is no unanimity in the intelligence community  and would explain the dissenting views or the lack of corroboration.” That absence of clarity has not slowed Mr. Trump when it comes to placing new sanctions on China and Iran  who pose very different kinds of challenges to American power. Yet the president made no apparent effort to sort through evidence on Russia  even before his most recent call with President Vladimir V. Putin  when he invited the Russian leader to a Group of 7 meeting planned for September in Washington. Russia has been banned from the group since the Crimea invasion  and Mr. Trump was essentially restoring it to the G8 over the objection of many of America’s closest allies. The White House will not say whether he would have acted differently had he been aware of the Russian bounty for American lives. “If you’re going to be on the phone with Vladimir Putin  this is something you ought to know ” said Representative Adam Schiff  Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  who managed the impeachment trial against Mr. Trump. “This is something you ought to know if you’re inviting Russia back into the G8.” It is just the latest example of how  in Mr. Trump’s “America First” approach  he rarely talks about Russia strategy other than to say it would be good to be friends. He relies on his gut and talks about his “good relationship” with Mr. Putin  echoing a line he often uses about Kim Jong-un  the North Korean dictator. So it is little surprise that after three and a half years  there is often hesitation to bring Mr. Trump damning intelligence about Russia. And in this case  there was another element: concern inside the White House about any intelligence findings that might interfere with the administration’s announcement of a peace deal with the Taliban. After months of broken-off negotiations  Mr. Trump was intent on announcing the accord in February  as a prelude to declaring that he was getting Americans out of Afghanistan. As one senior official described it  the evidence about Russia could have threatened that deal because it suggested that after 18 years of war  Mr. Trump was letting Russia chase the last American troops out of the country. The warning to Mr. Trump appeared in the president’s briefing book — which Mr. Bolton said almost always went unread — in late February. On Feb. 28  the president issued a statement that a signing ceremony for the Afghan deal was imminent. “When I ran for office ” Mr. Trump said in the statement  “I promised the American people I would begin to bring our troops home  and see to end this war. We are making substantial progress on that promise.” He dispatched Mr. Pompeo to witness the signing with the Taliban. And as Mr. Trump noted in a tweet over the weekend  there have been no major attacks on American troops since. (Instead  the attacks have focused on Afghan troops and civilians.) None The United States has accused Russia of providing general support to the Taliban before. But the newly revealed information about financial transfers bolstered other evidence of the plot  including detainee interrogations  and helped reduce an earlier disagreement among intelligence analysts and agencies over the reliability of the detainees. Lawmakers on Tuesday emerged from closed briefings on the matter to challenge why Mr. Trump and his advisers failed to recognize the seriousness of the intelligence assessment. “I am concerned that they did not pursue it as aggressively or comprehensively as perhaps they should have ” said Representative Adam Smith  a Washington Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee. “There was clearly evidence that the Russians were paying the bounties.” The oddity  of course  is that despite Mr. Trump’s deference to the Russians  relations between Moscow and Washington under the Trump administration have nose-dived. None Even Russian state television now regularly mocks Mr. Trump as a buffoon  very different from its gushing tone during the 2016 presidential election. Andrew Higgins contributed reporting.

None WASHINGTON — The Department of Housing and Urban Development on Wednesday proposed allowing homeless shelters to deny transgender people access to single-sex shelters of their gender identity. The housing department said in an announcement that the proposed regulation would ensure that shelters “must not discriminate based on sexual orientation or transgender status ” adding that the changes better accommodate the “religious beliefs of shelter providers.” The Trump administration has been pushing the change  arguing that it would prevent men from surreptitiously gaining access to women’s homeless shelters to abuse residents or track down spouses and partners. But advocates for lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender rights and civil libertarians said the rule would mean transgender women  potentially even other women mistaken as transgender  could be referred to shelters that also accommodate men  where they could face abuse or assault. Some women could lose access to shelter entirely. The housing department did not immediately respond to questions about the proposed rule. None None None None None None None None “We’ve seen this time and time again by this administration  of mincing words  and going out of their way to discriminate while saying they’re not ” Ms. Maril said. “It’s reclassifying what discrimination is. It’s trying to make turning someone away not discrimination.” Officials have previously said that such rules will ensure that men cannot slip into women’s shelters to abuse residents. In the announcement  the housing department added that those turned away from shelters under the rule must be provided with information about other shelters in the area. The Williams Institute report said that such policies lead “many transgender people to go unsheltered instead.” Even those that are admitted  the study said  face “an increased risk of harassment and victimization ” that is “often met by inaction by shelter staff.” None “There are going to be a lot of places where shelters are primarily religious and are primarily run by folks who don’t want to serve transgender women in women shelters ” Ms. Maril said. “It sounds great to say ‘Well  you can get a referral ’ but if that referral is to a men’s-only shelter  that is not an option. That is not a safe option.” Advertisement ,articles/politics

None None In an interview on “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning  the White House press secretary  Kayleigh McEnany  defended Mr. Trump’s decision to retweet the video of his supporters in Florida  even though it was pulled down after criticism from Republican lawmakers of the racist phrase “white power.” “His point in tweeting out that video was to stand with his supporters  who are oftentimes demonized ” Ms. McEnany said. “So he didn’t hear that portion.

And I hold myself and Michelle and our kids to that same standard.” Throughout their joint appearance  which ran a little over an hour  Mr. Obama — who speaks infrequently about Mr. Trump — praised Mr. Biden’s character and experience  and cast the president as a grave threat to the character and values of the nation. He said that Mr. Trump exploited and amplified divisions  and expressed concerns about the example he was setting on the world stage  citing his “militarized response to peaceful demonstrators” and saying he “basically threatens and consistently impugns the free press.” Such an approach  he suggested  emboldened dictators around the world who may doubt they will be held to account by the United States. Tim Murtaugh  a spokesman for Mr. Trump  said in response that the president “makes every decision based on what’s best for the people of the United States  rather than what will make him popular at the United Nations.” None “Unlike our current president  we recognize that we have a public health crisis going on ” Mr. Obama said  acknowledging that campaign volunteering may look different during the coronavirus outbreak. Chuckling incredulously  he invoked the nation’s top infectious disease expert. “Poor Dr. Fauci  who’s having to  you know  testify and then see his advice flouted by the person he’s working for ” Mr. Obama said. None On Tuesday  he spoke directly to younger Americans who are pressing for structural changes to address matters from racism to economic inequality to global warming. There is a “great awakening” among young people in particular  he said  who are “fed up with the shambolic  disorganized  mean-spirited approach” to governance in recent years  and want to tackle “some of the core challenges that have been facing this country for centuries.” But he also stressed the need to connect that ambition to electoral participation. Throughout the primary  Mr. Biden struggled to excite young Democratic voters  but he will need to find ways to turn many of them out in the general election. “Just because this energy is out there  it does not mean that it assures our victory ” he said. “And it does not mean that it gets channeled in a way that results in real change.” Mr. Obama also headlined a smaller virtual gathering Tuesday for big donors that raised another $3.4 million. Throughout the grass-roots event  Mr. Biden frequently expressed agreement with his former boss  whom he called “Mr. President ” as they discussed issues including health care access and foreign policy. They bantered some about Mr. Biden’s age — 77 — and the former vice president invoked the baseball player Satchel Paige. In Mr. Biden’s telling  Mr. Paige’s philosophy toward age was  “‘How old would you be if you didn’t know how old you were?’ I agree with Satchel Paige  I’m 50 ” Mr. Biden said. He also spoke passionately about the need to fight racism and spoke expansively about the evolution of civil rights in America. In the 1960s  he said  white Americans saw shocking images of the police like Alabama’s Bull Connor attacking black Americans with fire hoses  “and they’re going  ‘Oh my God. It really is happening.’ They saw it in black and white  no pun intended  because that’s what most TVs were at the time.” In contrast to the 1960s  he said  when it comes to civil rights and civic engagement  “this time around there is a much broader participation.” That level of engagement gave both Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden hope  they said. “Love you Joe ” Mr. Obama signed off. “Love you too  pal ” Mr. Biden said.

Here’s a fact-check. What Was Said “President Obama and Vice President Biden never even tried to fix this during their eight-year period. The reason they didn’t try is because they had no idea how to do it. And it is a complex situation.” None “The assertion that the Trump administration has done more than the Obama administration is ridiculous ” said Barry Friedman  a law professor and director of the Policing Project at New York University School of Law. “The Obama administration has taken a number of critical steps in police reform.” None None None “The language that Trump used during his announcement sounded exactly like the language in the Obama report ” Mr. Vitale said. None None “He and his staff are very familiar with our efforts because the F.O.P. lobbied them to limit the work we were doing ” said Roy L. Austin Jr.  who was deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division during the Obama administration. “The task force could not have produced a more powerful document in changing policing around the country. Immediately upon President Trump taking office  he made it clear he was eliminating those reforms.” None None None None Echoing the frustrations of many activists  Mr. Vitale said that the previous administration’s overhaul efforts had not produced significant results  but he added: “I don’t think Trump has done more.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/sunday/inequality-america-paul-krugman.html,Why Do the Rich Have So Much Power? Advertisement Supported by Americans may be equal  but some are more equal than others. None Opinion Columnist America is  in principle  a democracy  in which every vote counts the same. It’s also a nation in which income inequality has soared  a development that hurts many more people than it helps. So if you didn’t know better  you might have expected to see a political backlash: demands for higher taxes on the rich  more spending on the working class and higher wages. None The answer is that huge disparities in income and wealth translate into comparable disparities in political influence. To see how this works  let’s look at a fairly recent example: the budgetary Grand Bargain that almost happened in 2011. None None The question is  who wanted such a deal? Not the American public. None None So whose interests were actually reflected in the 2011 budget fight? The wealthy. None None In other words  in 2011 a Democratic administration went all-in on behalf of a policy concern that only the rich gave priority and failed to reach a deal only because Republicans didn’t want the rich to bear any burden at all. Why do the wealthy have so much influence over politics? None None And even the issues that the news media discuss often reflect a rich person’s agenda. Advertising dollars explain some of this bias  but a lot of it probably reflects subtler factors  like the (often false) belief that people who’ve made a lot of money have special insight into how the nation as a whole can achieve prosperity. None In a variety of ways  then  America’s wealthy exert huge political influence. Our ideals say that all men are created equal  but in practice a small minority is far more equal than the rest of us. None And no  the parties aren’t equally in the wealthiest Americans’ pocket. Democrats have become increasingly progressive  while the rich dominate the Republican agenda. Donald Trump may have run as a populist  but once in office he reversed much of that Obama tax hike  while trying (but failing  so far) to take away health insurance from as many as 23 million Americans. But while you shouldn’t be too much of a cynic  it remains true that America is less of a democracy and more of an oligarchy than we like to think. And to tackle inequality  we’ll have to confront unequal political power as well as unequal income and wealth. None None Advertisement ,articles/politics

We deserve a break. And when I say we  I mean all us black folks.” Nearly every act  appearance  acceptance speech and even advertisement that followed made some reference to the wave of protests against police brutality that spread worldwide after Floyd was killed in Minneapolis on Memorial Day  bringing renewed attention to many other cases of black people who have suffered at the hands of law enforcement or racist violence. None Megan Thee Stallion  who won the award for best female hip-hop artist  performed her hit “Savage” — sans Beyoncé  who appears on the remix — in a “Mad Max”-style desert landscape  complete with a black power fist background  while Legend was joined by a choir in an abandoned warehouse for a rendition of his latest tear-jerker  “We Will Never Break.” None Earlier  in fiery segments  Public Enemy was joined by Nas  Rapsody  Black Thought  Questlove  YG and Jahi for an updated version of the hip-hop classic “Fight the Power”  Lil Wayne led a rapped tribute to Kobe Bryant  and the North Carolina rapper DaBaby opened his remix of the Billboard No. 1 single “Rockstar” pressed up against asphalt  a police officer’s knee pressed into his neck in an unmistakable reference to the video of Floyd’s death.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/obamacare-trump-administration-supreme-court.html,Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Strike Down Affordable Care Act Advertisement Supported by If successful  the move would permanently end the health insurance program popularly known as Obamacare and wipe out coverage for as many as 23 million Americans. None WASHINGTON — The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court late Thursday to overturn the Affordable Care Act — a move that  if successful  would bring a permanent end to the health insurance program popularly known as Obamacare and wipe out coverage for as many as 23 million Americans. In an 82-page brief submitted an hour before a midnight deadline  the administration joined Republican officials in Texas and 17 other states in arguing that in 2017  Congress  then controlled by Republicans  had rendered the law unconstitutional when it zeroed out the tax penalty for not buying insurance — the so-called individual mandate. The administration’s argument  coming in the thick of an election season — as well as a pandemic that has devastated the economy and left millions of unemployed Americans without health coverage — is sure to reignite Washington’s bitter political debate over health care. In his brief  Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco argued that the health law’s two remaining central provisions are now invalid because Congress intended that all three work together. “Nothing the 2017 Congress did demonstrates it would have intended the rest of the A.C.A. to continue to operate in the absence of these three integral provisions ” the brief said  using the abbreviation for the name of the health care law. “The entire A.C.A. thus must fall with the individual mandate.” The Texas case is by far the most serious challenge to date for the 10-year-old health care law  President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. The Supreme Court has already ruled on two legal challenges to the act  and both times it has left most of the law in place. The court has not said when it will hear oral arguments  but they are most likely to take place in the fall  just as Americans are preparing to go to the polls in November. None None “President Trump and the Republicans’ campaign to rip away the protections and benefits of the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the coronavirus crisis is an act of unfathomable cruelty ” Ms. Pelosi said in a statement late Thursday night  after the administration’s brief was filed. “If President Trump gets his way ” she added  “130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions will lose the A.C.A.’s lifesaving protections and 23 million Americans will lose their health coverage entirely.” None When the case was argued in the trial court  the Trump administration  though a defendant  did not defend the law  siding instead with the plaintiffs. But unlike Texas and the other states  the administration argued at the time that only the law’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions should be struck down  but that the rest of the law  including its expansion of Medicaid  should survive. None None The Supreme Court has agreed to consider three legal questions in the case: whether Texas and two individual plaintiffs who have joined the suit have standing  whether Congress rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional  and  if it did  whether the rest of the law must fall with it.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/opinion/nuclear-weapons-trump.html,Who Can We Trust With the Nuclear Button? No One Advertisement Supported by None None Mr. Perry and Mr. Collina have collaborated on a forthcoming history of the nuclear arms race. The current debate about how President Trump is abusing his role as commander in chief has an even darker  nuclear dimension. If the president can misuse his authority to deploy troops against peaceful American protesters  might he also mishandle his authority to launch nuclear weapons? None None Unsettling as it may be  Mr. Trump has the absolute authority to start a nuclear war. Within minutes  the president could unleash the equivalent of more than 10 000 Hiroshima bombs. He does not need a second opinion. The defense secretary has no say. Congress has no role. Yet it would mean the end of civilization as we know it. None None So  why do we give so much power to one fallible human? It started 75 years ago  when President Harry Truman was shown the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and determined not to use the atomic bomb again. To him  that meant keeping it out of military hands. So Truman declared that no more atomic bombs could be dropped unless he personally authorized it — and the bomb has not been used since. But in addition to laudable civilian control  Truman set the dangerous precedent of one-person control. Atomic bombs became “the president’s weapons” and sole authority was reinforced as both the United States and the Soviet Union deployed ballistic missiles that could span the globe in 30 minutes or less. And the awesome ability to launch hundreds of thermonuclear weapons in mere minutes came with grave dangers. Would any president be able to make a wise decision under such crushing time pressures? What if it was a false alarm? How would the president know? None Luckily  we don’t need to take such risks. The whole concept of sole authority is built on the false assumption that Russia might launch a surprise first strike. The Cold War ended 30 years ago  and we now know that Russia never seriously considered a first strike against the United States  for the same reason that we never seriously considered a first strike against Russia: it would be national suicide. Both sides have to assume that an attack would provoke an unacceptable nuclear retaliation. Both nations  and much of the rest of the globe  would be obliterated. Starting such a war would be insanity. With this harrowing reality in mind  President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev  the Soviet Union’s leader as general secretary of the Communist Party  declared in 1985 that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.” They were right. By focusing on an unlikely surprise attack  we are making it more likely that we will blunder into Armageddon. In a crisis situation  the last thing we should want is for the president to feel under pressure to make a quick decision. Maintaining an effective deterrent does not require us to rush into a nuclear war  rather  we need to increase the decision time from minutes to hours. Here’s how: First: the president should not have sole authority for first use but should share that decision with a select group in Congress. There is no need to make this decision quickly. Second: The United States should declare that it will never start a nuclear war  and would only use the bomb in retaliation. Third: The United States should retire land-based ballistic missiles that could force a president into a quick “use-them-or-lose-them” decision. These missiles are not needed for deterrence  which is ensured by survivable submarine-based weapons. Seventy-five years ago  President Truman gave himself exclusive power over nuclear war. Every president since has clung to it. It was bad policy then  it is inexcusable now. We no longer need to take these risks  and we can safely back away from the brink. It is time to retire the nuclear button. No one should have the unchecked power to destroy the world.  None None None Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/us/politics/trump-daca.html,Trump Says Administration Will Try Again to End ‘Dreamers’ Program Advertisement Supported by Responding to Thursday’s Supreme Court decision  the president said he will follow the rules set out by the justices to challenge the Obama-era program protecting young immigrants from deportation. None None In September 2017  Mr. Trump moved to terminate the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  or DACA  making good on a 2016 campaign promise in which he called the program an illegal executive amnesty. On Thursday  the court said the administration had not followed the rules required to end the program  allowing it to remain in place for now. None “We will be submitting enhanced papers shortly in order to properly fulfill the Supreme Court’s ruling & request of yesterday ” Mr. Trump wrote. Within moments  one of Mr. Trump’s top immigration officials at the Department of Homeland Security  tweeted that the administration is eager to terminate the protections for the young immigrants in a way that will pass muster with the court. None Cracking down on illegal immigration was at the heart of the president’s first campaign  and Mr. Trump has spent much of the last three years waging an assault on the nation’s immigration system in an attempt to reduce the number of foreigners in the United States. The decision to end DACA was a centerpiece of those efforts. Put in place by former President Barack Obama  the program allows about 800 000 young immigrants who were brought to the United States as children to live and work legally without the threat of immediate deportation. Surveys show that most Americans — including a majority of Republicans — support allowing the young immigrants  known as Dreamers  to stay. But the president’s hard-line advisers  including Stephen Miller  the architect of his immigration agenda  have urged the president to follow through on his promise to his conservative supporters. A new effort to kill the program would draw another legal challenge that would be unlikely to be settled before the election. Mr. Trump’s announcement that he intends to again seek an end to the DACA protections sent a clear message to Capitol Hill  where top lawmakers acknowledged that legislative action will be needed to permanently address the fate of the group of young immigrants. “It grants a reprieve  obviously  for the Dreamers  which again  I think is very important and necessary ” Senator Lisa Murkowski  Republican of Alaska  said of the ruling. “But I also recognize that it then reminds us that it’s back in the lap of those of us here in Congress.” But veterans of the recent  fierce battles over immigration have expressed skepticism that the deeply divided lawmakers could reach consensus on broad immigration legislation in the months before the fall elections. Repeated efforts to negotiate an immigration deal between Democratic lawmakers and Mr. Trump in the last three years have all collapsed. In January of 2018  Mr. Trump appeared ready to embrace a bipartisan deal that would have given permanent  legal status to the Dreamers in exchange for border security enhancements and other immigration changes. But the possibility of a deal collapsed after an Oval Office meeting in which the president’s hard-line advisers rebelled against it and Mr. Trump asked “why would we want all these people from shithole countries?” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California expressed hope that something could be achieved  but also said lawmakers must be realistic. Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois  the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate  said that immigration reform was “worth a try — I’ve been trying for 20 years” and that he didn’t want “to walk away from any opportunity.” In a letter to Mr. Trump signed by Mr. Durbin and 40 other Democratic senators  Mr. Durbin urged the president not to end DACA. “We must ensure these talented young immigrants are not forced to stop working when the need for their public service has never been greater. And we must give them the chance they deserve to become American citizens ” the senators wrote. But some Republicans were not optimistic. “Comprehensive immigration reform has never worked  at least not in the time I’ve been here ” Senator John Cornyn  Republican of Texas  told reporters on Thursday. “So I think what we need to do is figure out how to take it in bite sized pieces and deal with it incrementally. I think if we did that on  on the DACA issue — because of the sympathetic nature of their plight — I think we’d have a better chance.” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the minority leader  said he disagreed with the court ruling and “it just reemphasizes that the House and Senate needs to do their work.” For more than two years  the DACA program has been essentially frozen — people who had applied before September 2017 were still protected from deportation and allowed to work legally. But new applicants to the program were prohibited while the courts decided whether the program could continue. Now  in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision  immigration advocates said they expected the program to resume full operations  though the administration has not made any formal announcement. After the ruling on Thursday  allies of the president urged him not to give up. “DACA was an illegal use of executive authority from the start. Clearly  an illegal policy must be reversed in order to restore the rule of law ” said Rosemary Jenks  the director of government relations for NumbersUSA  a group that pushes for reduced immigration. “The Court’s decision to require the administration to jump through additional procedural hoops to terminate an unlawful program that was created without jumping through those same hoops makes no sense ” she said. Mr. Trump did not say when his administration would issue a new order terminating the DACA program  and it remains unclear what will happen in the meantime. Supporters of the program urged Mr. Trump to abandon his efforts to eliminate it. “President Trump should forego any further efforts to wind down the DACA program before the election  and Congress should get to work right away to permanently address the status of DACA recipients and the broader Dreamer population ” said Theresa Cardinal Brown  the director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Instead  the president appears to be following the same playbook he used when courts blocked his efforts to impose a travel ban early in his administration. After two versions of the ban were rejected  the Supreme Court approved a third version  which remains in effect today. In a statement Thursday  a senior official at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  which administers the DACA program  repeated his desire to see the program end. “The fact remains that under DACA  hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens continue to remain in our country in violation of the laws passed by Congress and to take jobs Americans need now more than ever ” said Joseph Edlow  the deputy director for policy at the agency.

And too often some of that violence has come from folks who we’re supposed to be serving and protecting you. I want you to know that you matter. I want you to know that your lives matter  that your dreams matter. And when I go home and I look at the faces of my daughters  Sasha and Malia  and I look at my nephews and nieces  I see limitless potential that deserves to flourish and thrive. And you should be able to learn and make mistakes  and live a life of joy without having to worry about what’s going to happen when you walk to the store  or go for a jog  or driving down the street  or looking at some birds in a park.

And you have helped to make the entire country feel as if this is something that’s got to change. You’ve communicated a sense of urgency that is as powerful and as transformative as anything that I’ve seen in recent years. None None None “For those who have been talking about protest  just remember that this country was founded on protest — it is called the American Revolution ” Mr. Obama said from his home in Washington. He made the comments during an online round-table event with his former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. and activists from Minneapolis sponsored by My Brother’s Keeper Alliance  a nonprofit group Mr. Obama founded. None Mr. Obama called on every mayor in the United States to review use-of-force policies and to aggressively pursue an eight-point slate of police reforms that include mandatory de-escalation of conflicts  a ban on shooting at moving vehicles  timely reporting of violent incidents  and prohibitions on some forms of restraint used by the police. “Chokeholds and strangleholds  that’s not what we do ” Mr. Obama said as he sat  tieless in blue shirt sleeves  in front of a bookcase.  He said officials in New York City and Chicago had already agreed to adopt the measures. Other localities  including Atlanta  quickly followed suit. Mr. Obama also said that the “vast majority” of police officers  in his view  were not violent  and predicted many would ultimately support reforms despite the opposition of some unions. Reflecting on the larger meaning of the protests  Mr. Obama said the unrest after Mr. Floyd’s death was “unlike anything I have seen in my lifetime” and expressed hope that Americans would be “reawakened” to unite around racial justice.  “In a lot of ways  what has happened in the last several weeks is that challenges and structural problems here in the United States have been thrown into high relief ” he said. “They are the outcome of not just an immediate moment in time  but as the result of a long host of things — slavery  Jim Crow  redlining and institutional racism.” With the exception of his support for protesters  Mr. Obama confined his remarks to the issues of policing and racial disparities in health care during the coronavirus pandemic that have led to higher rates of infection and death in nonwhite communities. None None Instead  Mr. Obama expressed optimism that the reform effort could transcend political divisions. He said that he was heartened by polls showing broad support for their grievances  and that this made the current situation more heartening than the protests in the late 1960s. Mr. Obama’s remarks tracked closely with two essays he posted online over the last week in which he implored young protesters to channel their rage into political action by turning out for Mr. Biden in November and to embrace local reforms to hold police officers accountable for abuses of power. None None For all his outward calm  Mr. Obama’s passions are running high  and the former president is finding it harder to stay on script  friends said. Over the last few days  he has been working the phones with close associates  including Mr. Holder  and strategizing about the best way to address the issues without inflaming the crisis. None None None “It is a strength when protesters  protected by responsible law enforcement  march for a better future ” Mr. Bush said on Tuesday. “This tragedy — in a long series of similar tragedies — raises a long overdue question: How do we end systemic racism in our society? The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving.” Mr. Bush  the only living Republican former president — and one who refused to vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 — made no direct reference to the current president. But Mr. Bush spoke after Mr. Trump’s photo op havoc  and the former president’s comments read like a rebuke. “Those who set out to silence those voices ” Mr. Bush said  “do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place.” Mr. Obama struck a similar tone Wednesday  saying the overall message of the protests was simple  admirable and unifying:  “See me  I’m human ” he said.

The Black board member  Matthew Nowling  who had been the group’s communications director  will serve as interim president until a new election is held. None None Just before Ms. Guido stepped down Wednesday afternoon  she appointed Mr. Nowling as vice president — meaning he would become interim president when she resigned — and he accepted. He called the events of the past few days “encouraging steps towards creating a more inclusive and accountable environment.” Members said they saw this moment as the same sort of reckoning over racism that is taking place throughout the Democratic Party  and in society at large. Progressive groups have long spoken out against racism elsewhere  they said  now  college Democrats were rejecting it with equal force within their own ranks. “We have a choice to make about what type of organization we want to be moving forward ” Michael Cerulli  president of the Connecticut College Democrats  said on Tuesday evening. “Are we going to be an organization that is intentionally inclusive  or are we going to be an organization that sticks to the old ways of doing things?” The revolt began when Mr. Nowling  21  announced his resignation from the board on Saturday. The open letter was first published with the signatures of 17 federations  and within hours  that number had more than doubled. The College Democrats  the official college student branch of the Democratic Party  is the main vehicle for young people — a crucial constituency for Democratic candidates — to get involved in the party’s work. Its members register voters  encourage political activism and often campaign or work for candidates. Mr. Nowling  a student at Denison University in Ohio who was elected to the board last year and began his term in September  said other members had routinely ignored his suggestions  demeaned him and cast him as lazy and incompetent. These are “racist tropes that have been used against Black people for generations to prevent them from advancing in the workplace ” he said Sunday  during a virtual town hall meeting with C.D.A. members that was hastily arranged in response to his resignation. When he suggested that the College Democrats host a town hall on diversity  he recalled in an interview on Tuesday  one board member laughed out loud  and others did not take the idea seriously until a white member backed him up. A board member once mocked his clothing as “cheap” and suggested he take it “back to the thrift store ” he said  and on another occasion  a state federation leader complained that he focused too much on “Black issues.” Mr. Nowling said that Ms. Guido had “often been complicit or directly involved in what happened  and has not created an inclusive board.” “The only Black person on the national board was me  and I wasn’t respected  I wasn’t valued ” he said. “The needs of Black members were not prioritized in the organization.” Ms. Guido  a law student at the University of Florida  said that she had been unaware of Mr. Nowling’s allegations until he told her he was resigning  and that she had urged the offending board members to resign as soon as she found out. None “What I do not stand for is being labeled a racist or complacent in racism ” Ms. Guido wrote. “The gross mischaracterization that I contributed to this environment is unequivocally false. Moreover  these unsubstantiated claims of racism towards me have an appearance of being used as a front for personal disagreements  which is morally reprehensible.” But in an interview Wednesday morning  she acknowledged  “I may not be the person that membership feels represents them currently  and I may need to make space for someone who does.” In a statement a few hours later  after she resigned  she said she would take time “to slow down  reflect on my mistakes and spend time with family.” Xochitl Hinojosa  a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee  said it was providing leadership guidance  training and other resources to the College Democrats as they decided how to proceed. “We are a party of inclusion that’s fully committed to helping the next generation of Democrats carry the torch to help build a unified America ” Ms. Hinojosa said. Beyond his own experience  Mr. Nowling said that structural issues — like the fact that C.D.A. members have to pay for their own travel to official events — often kept low-income students like him out of leadership positions and prevented rank-and-file members from attending the organization’s conventions. Erica Kelly  a board member and head of the Virginia chapter of the College Democrats  said that because no one from her state could afford to go the national convention in New Orleans last year  it had no say in the party business or votes conducted there. “It’s fundamentally been kind of an elitist institution for a really long time ” said Ms. Kelly  19  a rising junior at George Mason University who joined the board last month. “I do feel really confident  now that 41 state federations have come together asking to break the cycle  that we will be able to.” Several members and leaders said the town hall meeting arranged after Mr. Nowling’s resignation  far from soothing tensions  had underscored some of the very problems Mr. Nowling  Ms. Kelly and others described: The call was held using software that charged at least some participants a fee per minute. Chloe Mieras  the membership director of the College Democrats of Ohio  said that it took her five or six tries to join because the system kept rejecting the code she had been given  and that she was charged a base fee for every attempted call in addition to the per-minute charge once she finally connected. Ms. Guido said that it was the same software the executive board normally used for its own calls  and that she hadn’t realized anyone would be required to pay. Mr. Nowling said he believed the charges kicked in when the number of participants went over a certain threshold. Ms. Mieras  22  said that as soon as Mr. Nowling’s statement began to circulate widely on Saturday  a group chat among state federation leaders filled up with outrage on his behalf  and that the town hall did not substantively address their concerns. Mr. Nowling said he had decided to resign in part because members who had demeaned him had also praised the Black Lives Matter movement and presented themselves as allies of Black people. He said that he was encouraged by the state federations’ support  and that he believed that in a different organization  his concerns might “have been brushed under the rug  and I would have simply resigned and nothing would have changed.” “This is not just a College Democrats of America thing ” Mr. Nowling said. “This is a broader societal issue  and I just happened to have a platform where when I spoke out about it  people took action.” Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/climate/house-democrats-climate-plan.html,Democrats Detail a Climate Agenda Tying Environment to Racial Justice Advertisement Supported by The policy road map  expected on Tuesday  could guide the party if it gains control of Congress and the White House in November. None WASHINGTON — Democrats in Congress are expected to make public on Tuesday a broad list of proposals on climate change  laying out in detail what could become the starting point for their climate agenda if the party regains control of Congress and the White House next year. The 538-page report sets a range of targets including ensuring that every new car sold by 2035 emits no greenhouse gases  eliminating overall emissions from the power sector by 2040  and all but eliminating the country’s total emissions by 2050. None The package also approaches climate change as a matter of racial injustice. The report cites the police killing of George Floyd in its opening paragraph and goes on to argue that communities of color are also more at risk from the effects of climate change. The report says the government should prioritize minority communities for new spending on energy and infrastructure. “We have to focus on environmental-justice communities ” said Representative Kathy Castor  Democrat of Florida and chairwoman of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis  which compiled the report. “There is an awakening across the country to systemic racism  and this is a report that at its center  at its core  focuses on those communities.” Few of the proposals are likely to go anywhere this year because they would require support from the Republican-led Senate as well as President Trump  who has called climate change a hoax. But as a political statement the package is notable because it presents what Democrats call a comprehensive legislative agenda for climate change at a time when public support is on the rise. None Still  a major challenge remains: how to address the demands of climate activists without alienating more centrist voters. None None None Representative Garret Graves of Louisiana  the leading Republican on the climate committee  said the two parties had found some common ground  including on the need to make communities more resilient to natural disasters. But where the two sides diverged  he said  was on the question of the continued use of fossil fuels. Mr. Graves said Democrats’ view boiled down to  “fossil fuels are evil.” “In my opinion  that ignores the science ” Mr. Graves said  stressing that he had not seen the report that Democrats planned to release. “If you can find ways to utilize the fuels  but have as good or better emissions  then that is a viable option.” Ms. Castor said the measures included in the report  including new federal spending on energy and infrastructure  would create new jobs and opportunities. The proposals call for cutting emissions of methane  an extremely potent greenhouse gas  from the oil and gas sector two-thirds by 2025  making all new residential and commercial buildings effectively zero-emissions by 2030 and setting “climate stewardship practice goals across all U.S. farmland.” None “Carbon pricing is not a silver bullet ” the report says  adding that energy-intensive industries that try to reduce pollution should remain “on a level playing field with foreign competitors that use dirtier technologies.” In a sign of how quickly the discussion around climate change has shifted  the report also embraces positions that might have seemed radical just a few years ago. It cites a 2018 United Nations report that found preventing a dangerous level of global warming is not possible simply by cutting emissions  and requires finding a way to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere as well. Congress must “dramatically increase federal investment in carbon removal research and development ” the report says. The report also says that as hurricanes  flooding and other effects of climate change accelerate  the government must spend more to fortify vulnerable communities with better infrastructure  but that doing so won’t be enough. In some cases  people will need to move. “Communities need support developing longer-term strategies  including options to relocate and resettle willing neighborhoods or communities ” the report reads. Federally funded programs should “consider the trade-offs of relocation and protection.” The prospect of climate-driven migration  both internal and across borders  is so serious that it must be incorporated into the country’s national defense and homeland security planning  the report adds. “Developing countries are especially ill-prepared to face the impacts of climate change ” the report says. “The resulting humanitarian and refugee crises  if unchecked  have the potential to become national security threats.” Lisa Friedman contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/politics/congress-police-reform-senate.html,Senate Democrats Plan to Block G.O.P. Police Bill  Stalling Overhaul Advertisement Supported by Calling Republicans’ legislation “woefully inadequate ” Democrats urged Senator Mitch McConnell  the majority leader  to negotiate a new  more expansive bill both parties could support. None WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats said on Tuesday that they would block Republicans’ attempts to advance a narrow bill to encourage police departments to revise their practices  rejecting the measure as “woefully inadequate” and setting up a clash that could mark the death of a fledgling congressional effort to address racial bias in law enforcement. None None “No bill will pass as a result of this ploy by Senator McConnell ” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the minority leader  said on the Senate floor  referring to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader. Mr. Schumer implored Republicans to negotiate a more expansive bill that both parties could support. “The Republican majority has given the Senate a bad bill and proposed no credible way to sufficiently improve it ” he said. None None None None Republicans were furious on Tuesday at Democrats’ refusal to advance the measure and accused them of deliberately creating a logjam for political purposes  rather than trying to find a way to enact meaningful change. “If your objective is to solve the issue of police reform and not campaign on the issue of police reform  the way you do that is by coming to the table and voting yes  so that we have an opportunity before the entire American public to understand what the differences are  iron them out and move it forward ” Mr. Scott told reporters. “If this is more about campaign rhetoric and presidential elections  then they will not vote yes for this.” Mr. McConnell brushed away Democrats’ complaints and insisted that the Senate would proceed with the vote on Wednesday as planned  arguing that they should at least try to modify the measure rather than rejecting it before even starting debate. “If they don’t feel like they’ve had fair treatment  their remedy is to refuse to finish the bill ” he said. “There’s literally no harm done by debating this important topic.” But Democrats appeared to see plenty of risk in proceeding with a measure that falls well short of what their core supporters demand  and to be confident that voters would blame Republicans  not them  for the death of the policing overhaul effort. They have been making the case for nearly two years that the Senate has become a legislative graveyard for Democratic initiatives  an impression Mr. McConnell himself has often fed. In a letter on Tuesday to Mr. McConnell  Mr. Schumer  along with Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey — sponsors of the Democratic bill — called the Republican measure “so threadbare and lacking in substance that it does not even provide a proper baseline for negotiations.” “We will not meet this moment by holding a floor vote on the Justice Act  nor can we simply amend this bill ” they wrote. “This bill is not salvageable  and we need bipartisan talks to get to a constructive starting point.” They received additional cover after dozens of civil rights groups  including the N.A.A.C.P. and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights wrote to lawmakers urging them to block the legislation. “The question simply is: Who do you trust more on police reform in America?” Mr. Booker said. “The N.A.A.C.P. or Mitch McConnell?” The breakdown fueled frustration in both parties on Tuesday  with Republicans and Democrats bitterly pointing fingers at each other for the emerging stalemate  even as a frenzied round of hushed discussions unfolded in private to try to salvage the effort. None “It’s like asking a mother: save one of your children and leave the others ” Ms. Harris replied. In private  Mr. Scott shocked his colleagues when he spoke at Republicans’ weekly luncheon about death threats he and his aides had received in recent days  according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door remarks. He played some aloud for his colleagues  all of whom are white. The calls  filled with profanity and racist slurs  included one diatribe addressed to “Uncle Tim ” where the caller  after cruelly and profanely condemning Mr. Scott  his family and some of his Republican colleagues  told Mr. Scott to “take your one-way ticket straight to hell.” One caller discussed putting the senator “in his cross hairs ” Mr. Scott said. “It’s interesting that we are on the right side of the police reform conversation  yet we’re on the wrong side according to the people  based on the way that we are characterized in the national press ” Mr. Scott said in a brief interview  after playing two of the calls his office had received. While racist attacks and threats are not new to Mr. Scott or his office  he said they had become more aggressive in recent days. Both parties have reason to resist a compromise. Republicans in recent weeks have rushed to devise a response to the public outcry for change  putting forward significant policing legislation for the first time in years and beginning to speak in frank terms about racism in America  a topic they have often avoided. But they are unwilling to stray too far from President Trump — who has emphasized “law and order ” advocated tough police tactics and ignored the issue of racism in law enforcement — and risk alienating their base with the kind of sweeping measures Democrats are demanding. None “I do not intend to be a part of a discussion where some might suggest Democrats are trying to stand in the way of police reform ” Ms. Harris told reporters. “In this case  sadly  it is the Democrats — not with any of our Republican colleagues  at least so far — that are doing the real work of engaging in what must be reform of the system.” Some lawmakers were holding out hope that closed-door conversations between Mr. Scott  Mr. Booker  Ms. Harris and others could yet yield a compromise. But leaving one such meeting on Tuesday afternoon  Mr. Scott voiced no such optimism. “If they won’t even start it ” he said of Democrats  “that tells me that this is already over.” Emily Cochrane  Nicholas Fandos and Luke Broadwater contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/nyregion/ny-27-special-election.html,In a G.O.P. Stronghold  a Vacant House Seat Gives Democrats Hope Advertisement Supported by A special election in Western New York on Tuesday may be another test of President Trump’s support in the November 2020 election. None BATAVIA  N.Y. — Last time around  Nate McMurray seemed to have everything going his way. None Despite those advantages  Mr. McMurray  a Democrat  fell short  losing by less than 1 100 votes. The result underscored Mr. McMurray’s challenge  then and now. The 27th Congressional District is about as Republican as New York  a deep blue state  can get. Donald Trump carried the district by some 25 points in 2016  and Mr. Collins had been one of the president’s earliest and most ardent supporters. None None None None Now  however  Mr. Jacobs seems to be banking on the president’s appeal and Mr. McMurray’s disdain for him. “It’s clear that Nate hates Trump ” Mr. Jacobs said  adding  “The majority of the voters in this district support Trump.” Indeed  on one point  at least  Mr. Jacobs and Mr. McMurray seem to agree: 2020 will be a referendum on the president. “A win would be a punch in the eye to Trumpism ” said Mr. McMurray. “A close loss would be the same.” But if Democratic Party leaders think the contest has added significance  they are not acting that way: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  for instance  has done little to support Mr. McMurray’s campaign. “They’re terrible ” Mr. McMurray said. adding that if he had more help from Democratic leadership in 2018 — or now — he’d win “in a landslide.”  Robyn Patterson  a spokeswoman for the D.C.C.C.  didn’t comment directly on Mr. McMurray’s remarks  but noted the circumstances of Mr. Collins’s departure and said  “House Democrats are on offense in races across the country.” Mr. Jacobs  a scion of a wealthy Buffalo family  earned the Republican nomination in late January after being endorsed by eight county chairs in the district  an anvil-shaped chunk of suburban and rural towns between Buffalo and Rochester. The special election is for the remainder of Mr. Collins’s term  which ends this year  the seat will be contested again in November for a full two-year term. In a peculiar wrinkle  Mr. Jacobs is not only running against Mr. McMurray in the special election  he is also simultaneously running in the Republican primary against two challengers — Beth Parlato and Stefan Mychajliw Jr. — on Tuesday. It is theoretically possible for Mr. Jacobs to defeat Mr. McMurray but lose in the Republican primary — meaning that he could represent the district for the remainder of this year  but then have to defend his seat in November  running against the Republican nominee on the ballot line of the Independence Party  which also nominated Mr. Jacobs. Mr. McMurray also plans to run in November on the Democratic line  setting up an almost inevitable sequel to the current campaign  regardless of who wins on Tuesday. None None “I think its reasonable to say if you want to run for Congress  you should take a leave of absence ” Mr. Jacobs said. “But that’s all I know.” Like campaigns nationwide  the race in the 27th has been complicated by the coronavirus outbreak and intensified by the civil unrest that erupted following the George Floyd killing on Memorial Day. Mr. Jacobs  who cuts a quieter  more subdued figure than Mr. McMurray  is in his second term representing a district comprising a number of Buffalo suburbs  after a stint as county clerk in Erie County. He dismisses the notion of an upset  saying that Mr. McMurray is wildly out of step with the mores and mood of the 27th. “His politics are wrong for this district ” said Mr. Jacobs  who is 53  married  with a toddler at home. “He is very liberal. He is for much more of a socialist America. And this district does not align with that.” He added: “I think that he’d be much more appropriate running in Manhattan.” Nick Langworthy  the chairman of the state Republican Party  echoed this  calling Mr. McMurray “all in with the radical left for socialism  anarchy and open borders.” “The last thing voters want is a rubber-stamp acolyte of Nancy Pelosi and A.O.C. ” he said  referring to the House speaker and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  two Democrats who have not always agreed on policy and messaging. Mr. McMurray  45  does support many of the policies embraced by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party but said his logic for doing so is less about hewing a liberal line and more about practical concerns. “I’ve only thought about what would help my family ” said Mr. McMurray  who is married with two children. “Do I think that health care for every single American is something that’s going to help me win? I don’t know. But I know it would help my family and my neighborhood. So if other people classify these positions as too left  that’s their problem.” None None For farmers like Doug Tillotson  the pressing issues of this election are immigration  which is vital to supply agricultural labor  as well as crop subsidies. “We don’t look for a handout  though we have to take it ” said Mr. Tillotson  one of a handful of people attending an event for Jacobs at Hi-Land Farms  a family-run dairy farm in Wyoming  N.Y. “I just hope he can see the plight of different people in New York.” At a recent rally in Batavia  however  Mr. McMurray’s supporters were more vocal  chanting the candidate’s name through protective masks and waving campaign signs. None All told  about 50 people circled around as Mr. McMurray  wearing work boots  jeans and a dark plaid shirt  strode back and forth promising a victory on June 23. “We can’t be timid  this is not a time for timidness ” he said. “Our country is at a crossroads  right? We’re at a crossroads. And if we don’t change things  it’s going to get worse.” Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/us/hickenlooper-colorado-romanoff-gardner.html,Hickenlooper Stumbles in Colorado Race  Complicating Democrats’ Senate Push Advertisement Supported by The former governor has faltered in a primary campaign for a seat that is essential for Democrats to capture if they hope to retake the Senate majority. None KREMMLING  Colo. — For months  Democrats have figured that Colorado’s U.S. Senate race  a linchpin of their strategy to take back the majority in November  was essentially in the bag  with the Republican incumbent Cory Gardner trailing by double digits behind their candidate John Hickenlooper  the well-liked and well-known former two-term governor and Denver mayor. But Mr. Hickenlooper  who was coaxed into the Senate contest after ending his brief presidential run  has faltered in recent weeks ahead of the primary race on Tuesday. He now finds himself in a tougher-than-expected contest with Andrew Romanoff  a former state House speaker and another longtime Colorado political presence  in a fight with significant implications for the general election and control of the Senate. None “He has had a bad June ” Kyle Saunders  a political-science professor at Colorado State University  said about Mr. Hickenlooper’s multiple travails and missteps. Chief among them was a contempt finding by the state’s independent ethics commission for defying a subpoena to appear at a hearing on a complaint against him — an event that prompted disastrous news coverage across the state. None But Democrats worry that his rockier-than-expected race may leave him weakened for the general-election fight and give Mr. Gardner new life in a campaign where he was a rare incumbent underdog. “He is limping out of this primary and now has a vulnerability that didn’t exist several weeks ago ” Dick Wadhams  a former state Republican Party chairman and veteran Senate campaign strategist  said about Mr. Hickenlooper and his run-in with the ethics panel. The unexpected volatility of the primary — and the chance to inflict additional damage on Mr. Hickenlooper — has generated a last-minute surge of campaign advertising as national Republicans  Mr. Gardner and Mr. Romanoff have ganged up on Mr. Hickenlooper from the right and the left  while national Democrats and an independent group have swooped in to defend the former governor in the primary’s closing days. Millions of dollars are being spent. Mr. Hickenlooper’s troubles go beyond the ethics complaint  which accused him of having improperly accepted private jet and limousine rides as governor. In a series of forums and debates with his opponent  Mr. Hickenlooper  68  made several eyebrow-raising statements. He said that George Floyd  the black Minneapolis man who died after a police officer knelt on his neck  had been shot. In response to a question about the Black Lives Matter movement  Mr. Hickenlooper said that every life matters  a comment considered dismissive of legitimate black grievances. He later acknowledged that he fumbled his response. Then a six-year-old video surfaced of Mr. Hickenlooper comparing the rigors of a politician’s schedule to working on a slave ship  a remark critics cited as painfully insensitive. He again apologized. Months earlier  in rejecting appeals to run for the Senate rather than president  Mr. Hickenlooper said multiple times that he was not cut out for the Senate and could not see being very good at it  only to turn around and join the race after getting no traction in his White House bid. Allies of Mr. Hickenlooper say he has always lacked the verbal discipline of a typical politician — and that is part of the quirky  authentic personality that voters have come to appreciate and admire. “Colorado voters know John Hickenlooper really  really well ” said Melissa Miller  a campaign spokeswoman. “What people really like about him is he is a real guy. He is not a slick  talking-point politician.” (The campaign declined to make Mr. Hickenlooper available for an interview.) Mr. Hickenlooper’s gaffes would have provided negative campaign fodder in any event  but the biggest error came in his handling of a complaint filed by Republicans in 2018 that accused him of improperly taking gifts and private jet trips as governor. Subpoenaed to testify on June 4 in a virtual hearing because of the pandemic  Mr. Hickenlooper and his legal adviser instead argued for a delay so he could appear later in person without the distractions and glitches of an online proceeding. He was then a no-show for the teleconference and the ethics commission held him in contempt  setting off a wave of negative coverage that made it appear as if he was not taking the complaint seriously. Chastened  Mr. Hickenlooper testified the next day  defending the trips as either personal business or efforts to promote Colorado. But the commission eventually fined him $2 750 for two violations and refused to vacate its contempt finding. National Republicans  who were always planning to hit Mr. Hickenlooper on the ethics question  accelerated their planned post-primary advertising to take advantage of the furor and aired a spot that rounded up news coverage hammering the former governor. “We did it because of how badly Hick was mishandling the ethics hearing ” said Kevin McLaughlin  head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “He and his team were bumbling idiots  and we felt like we couldn’t let the opportunity pass.” Mr. Romanoff  who lost a Denver-area House race in 2014 and a primary battle for the Senate in 2010  has also taken Mr. Hickenlooper to task on the ethics issue  drawing rebukes from other Democrats who have urged him to drop the attacks. By embracing “Medicare for all” and the Green New Deal  Mr. Romanoff has sought to contrast himself with Mr. Hickenlooper’s more moderate image and tap into the growing progressive bloc of Colorado Democrats who helped Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont win the state’s presidential primary this year with 37 percent of the vote. Mr. Romanoff also said Mr. Hickenlooper’s campaign effort has validated the former governor’s original claim that he wasn’t that interested in joining the Senate. “We haven’t detected any enthusiasm for his candidacy  including from him ” Mr. Romanoff said in an interview. “I just think it has been an appalling performance. There is nothing he has done in this campaign to convince me that he was wrong when he said he would be a terrible senator.” Hoping to counter Mr. Romanoff’s criticism and a perception in some Democratic circles that he is out of step with the state’s evolving Democratic electorate  the Hickenlooper campaign has touted endorsements from Washington figures such as Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey  both of whom joined Mr. Hickenlooper in the presidential primary field. “I feel like the momentum has changed in the last few days ” Mr. Hickenlooper said in a local television interview that aired on Friday  crediting the national endorsements and a rush of local and state Democrats who switched their backing from Mr. Romanoff to him after an attack ad from his rival. With Mr. Hickenlooper under fire  Mr. Gardner has also plunged into the fray. His opening campaign ad mocked Mr. Hickenlooper’s early comments about his lack of interest in being in the Senate  with Mr. Gardner pretending to be a therapist and noting that Mr. Hickenlooper has some issues to work through. “To do this job  you probably need to want this job ” a smiling Mr. Gardner says at the end. Republican strategists say they believe that Mr. Gardner  a polished campaigner who led the party’s Senate campaign organization in 2016  could hold off Mr. Hickenlooper given the weaknesses the former governor has displayed in the primary. Yet even with Mr. Hickenlooper’s troubles  Democrats and analysts say that Mr. Gardner’s fate is tied to that of Mr. Trump  who lost the state in 2016 to Hillary Clinton and is trailing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in polls here. They say that Mr. Gardner  who early on endorsed the president for re-election  has not done enough to separate himself from Mr. Trump  who was an anchor on the senator’s campaign even before the president’s most recent decline in popularity. “There is too much drag on him from the president and it is getting even worse ” said Floyd Ciruli  a longtime pollster and Colorado political analyst. “I just have a hard time seeing Cory being able to beat that tide.” Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/nyregion/ny-house-primaries.html,"Insurgent Wave in New York Pushes Old Guard Democrats Aside Advertisement Supported by Three insurgent candidates were poised to win their congressional primaries in New York  hinting at a broad directional change for the party. None It was evident in marquee congressional contests  in a county district attorney race and in numerous battles for state legislative seats: A political sea change has swept New York. After the count of ballots cast in person last week  insurgent Democrats were poised to topple or succeed longtime incumbents. Many of the challengers are candidates of color  many of the incumbents are white. Representative Eliot L. Engel  a House veteran in his 32nd year who leads the Foreign Affairs Committee  appeared to be the biggest name likely to fall  he was badly trailing Jamaal Bowman  a black middle school principal from Yonkers. In the State Legislature  at least six incumbents  mostly male and white  were either trailing or in close races against insurgent candidates. With nearly two million absentee ballots issued to voters statewide because of the coronavirus outbreak  very few races have been called  county elections officials will begin counting those ballots on Wednesday. But the machine ballot count made it clear that New York politics is in the midst of a generational political shift  one that has been precipitated not only by the progressive energy and shifting attitudes toward racial equity that have swept the nation  but by the diversity in race  sexuality and gender of the candidates that voters are catapulting to office. The shift was magnified by the candidacies of two men  Mondaire Jones and Ritchie Torres  attempting to make historic runs for the House: If elected  they would become the first openly gay black members of Congress.  In the South Bronx  Mr. Torres  who identifies as Afro-Latino  leads his closest competitor  Assemblyman Michael Blake  the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee  by more than 4 500 votes. None Much of the leftward lurch is rooted in President Trump’s election in 2016 and his re-election bid this year  and fueled by the inroads of Senator Bernie Sanders’s two presidential candidacies  which thrust his democratic socialist ideology and calls for revolution into the political mainstream across the country. But it was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s stunning primary upset in 2018 against Joseph Crowley  one of the House’s highest-ranking members  which gave voters and progressive groups the confidence to take on entrenched incumbents  especially in New York. None “This moment feels like continued momentum and progress ” Ms. Cabán  now a national political organizer for the Working Families Party  said in an interview. “You can call it progressive  you can call it liberal  or you can call it people who just want a foot off their neck.” The political shift has also been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic  which has magnified longstanding racial health disparities  and the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minnesota. Maurice Mitchell  national director of the Working Families Party  said that last Tuesday’s elections were a “referendum on black lives” that signaled a political realignment was in progress. “This was a ‘what side are you on’ moment ” he said. The early results underscored a national trend in Democratic politics that seems to be playing out in New York  too: Candidates of color are assembling broad winning coalitions that bring together liberal white voters and voters of color. White majority districts can be led by people of color and black candidates if the message is broad  progressive and inclusive  said Sochie Nnaemeka  head of the New York State Working Families Party. “Voters are hungry for a different type of leadership ” she said. Nowhere does that appear to be more true than in Mr. Jones’s race in the 17th Congressional District  which includes Rockland County and parts of Westchester County and is majority white and only 10 percent black.  “My story is quintessentially the American dream  and people want to be inspired by their elected officials ” said Mr. Jones  who grew up poor in Rockland County and then went to Stanford University and to Harvard Law School. “When people bring their lived experience with them to policymaking  that process becomes more informed.” Race and identity politics were not necessarily the only thing driving insurgent campaigns. Most candidates ran on unabashedly left-wing platforms  supporting Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. They hammered their opponents for being absent from their districts. In Westchester County  a female federal prosecutor  Mimi Rocah  whose campaign was centered on a progressive “Right Side of Justice” agenda  was leading the incumbent district attorney  Anthony Scarpino. Many challengers had deep ties to their communities: They were teachers  activists  tenant organizers. But race was certainly an underlying factor in many of the candidacies  and it was amplified by the recent civil unrest over police brutality. During Mr. Bowman’s speech to supporters on the night of the primary  he talked about how black men in America experience “death and homicide and suicide” at an early age. Poverty  he said  was “by design” and rooted in America’s racist history. “Eliot Engel  and I’ll say his name once  used to say that he was a thorn in the side of Donald Trump ” Mr. Bowman said  referring to the incumbent he’s looking to unseat. “But you know what Donald Trump is afraid of more than anything else? A black man with power.” In an interview  Mr. Bowman  44  said he spoke about his experience as a black man in America  and how he worked to help underserved children and families in the Bronx in all parts of the district during the campaign.  “I don’t expect white allies to have the same consciousness of being black in America as me when I first meet them ” Mr. Bowman said. “There is a learning process and a dialogue process that happens.” The anti-establishment sentiment was also prominently in display in Queens  one of the most ethnically diverse parts of the country and the bedrock of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign. There  three candidates for State Assembly — Jessica González-Rojas  who is of Paraguayan and Puerto Rican descent  Jenifer Rajkumar  who is Indian-American  and Zohran Mamdani  who is from Uganda and is of Indian descent — were all beating white incumbents as of Tuesday. Bruce Gyory  a Democratic political consultant  said young  energetic candidates of color were successfully fusing left-wing activism with the changing demographics of Queens.  None Matt Thomas  a member of the Democratic Socialists of America  which backed Mr. Mamdani’s campaign  credited the group’s success to ideology  not demographics or race. “People are starting to realize there is a whole different set of values and philosophy of progressivism ” he said. Still  none of the group’s five candidates this election cycle were white. None The group’s organizing tactics have also been sharpened with each successive election season  and its fund-raising has become more robust following its earlier successes. None Other mainstream Democrats such as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Representative Hakeem Jeffries  the No. 5 Democrat in the House  may also face insurgent candidates of color. In 2018  Mr. Cuomo easily turned back Cynthia Nixon’s Democratic primary challenge  Charlie King  a longtime Democratic operative and a former senior campaign adviser to Mr. Cuomo  said that the governor and Mr. Jeffries most likely had little to worry about. “When predators are at the watering hole looking for wildebeest or elephants to eat they don’t go after the strong ones  Hakeem the elephant and Cuomo the elephant have tusks "" Mr. King said. “The Engel elephant — who was very powerful in his day — had three legs.” Advertisement ",articles/politics

None The Nebraska Democratic Party has withdrawn its support for its Senate candidate  Chris Janicek  after he made sexually explicit comments about one of his campaign staff members in a group text that included her. None On Monday  Mr. Janicek refused to do so  and the party’s executive committee voted unanimously to withdraw its support and resources from his campaign. “Our Democratic Party has no tolerance for sexual harassment ” Jane Kleeb  the chairwoman of the Nebraska Democratic Party  said in the statement. “Our party will not extend resources or any type of support to any candidate that violates our code of conduct and doesn’t treat men and women with the dignity and respect they deserve.” The staff member  who has since quit  also filed a formal complaint with the party. Mr. Janicek did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday afternoon. In a text sent on June 4 to her and four other people — a screen shot of which her lawyer  Vince Powers  provided to The New York Times on the condition that the woman’s name be withheld — Mr. Janicek said that he had discussed a work matter with her and that she had argued with him and walked away. “Do you think the campaign should spend some I’m getting her laid ” he wrote  adding  “It will probably take three guys.” He then described in explicit terms what he wanted the men to do to her. “Thoughts?!” He sent a second text apologizing for his grammar and clarifying that he had meant to say “spend some money on ” not “spend some I’m” — repeating the sexual suggestion in the process. Finally  he wrote that he had been joking. “I’m going on no sleep and a bunch of exuberant excitement and I think I was out of line now that I read my text back I apologize ” he wrote  adding that he “valued” the woman and wanted “to issue apologies again for my tasteless statements.” The woman responded with a lengthy message in which she discussed their work-related disagreement and then said of Mr. Janicek’s text: “As a woman who stands up and beside other women  I can’t just pretend this didn’t happen. I cannot support your campaign after what you said. I have integrity  morals and values but  most of all I have self respect for myself and fellow women.” “I understand ” Mr. Janicek replied. But after party leaders met with him on Thursday and pushed him to withdraw from the race  Mr. Janicek showed up unannounced at the staff member’s house  according to her lawyer  Mr. Powers. The woman was rattled  Mr. Powers added  and did not engage in a conversation with Mr. Janicek or accept his apology. On Friday  Mr. Powers emailed Mr. Janicek to tell him not to contact the woman again or have anyone else contact her on his behalf  and urged him to drop out of the Senate race “so as to hopefully prevent any further embarrassment or anxiety.” “We all expect Mr. Janicek to drop out shortly ” Mr. Powers said on Tuesday. “One has to be an optimist and an idealist to be a young staffer working on a statewide race for a Democrat in Nebraska. This has been a tough experience for my client. She wants to change the world  not to have to deal with this garbage.” Mr. Janicek  a bakery owner  won the Democratic primary last month to challenge Senator Ben Sasse  the Republican incumbent. Nebraska is a solidly red state  and the race is not expected to be competitive. Ms. Kleeb  the state party chairwoman  said the party had received a copy of the texts on June 5  the day after they were sent  and immediately contacted Mr. Janicek to set up a meeting. The meeting happened on June 11  and after party leaders asked him to step down  Mr. Janicek asked for a few days to consider it. On Monday  he said he would not end his campaign  at which point party leaders voted to withdraw their support. Their decision means that Mr. Janicek will not have access to any party resources  including money and voter file data. He will not be included in any Democratic campaign literature or on the party’s website  and cannot hold events with county parties or other Democratic candidates. But there is no legal process to remove him from the ballot unless he files paperwork to withdraw. Ms. Kleeb said the party would continue to pressure him to do that. If he does  the party’s central committee will meet to elect a replacement candidate. The deadline to replace Mr. Janicek on the ballot is Sept. 1. Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/nyregion/eliot-engel-jamaal-bowman-primary.html,Top Democrats Are Trying to Stop This Man From Becoming the Next A.O.C. Advertisement Supported by Representative Eliot Engel’s primary contest against Jamaal Bowman in New York is a test of the Democratic establishment’s ability to withstand its emboldened left wing. None None The Democratic establishment has apparently heeded that lesson. None None Mr. Engel  73  seems to be the party’s most vulnerable incumbent in the nation at the moment  a potential victim of its emboldened left wing  which has grown impatient with the establishment politics that Mr. Engel seems to represent. None None None Senator Warren  the former presidential candidate and possible vice-presidential contender  said on Tuesday that Mr. Bowman was “exactly the kind of person we need in Congress fighting for big  structural change.” None None None Asked about the comment  Mr. Engel did not address it directly but said that he had “wanted people to know how I feel because I feel so strongly about what happened” in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd by the police in Minneapolis. “In looking back  I see now that two weeks later that my words have detracted from the protests because they’ve been taken out of context ” he said. “And I want to use my voice to refocus on the fact black lives matter. And they do.” None Mr. Engel’s campaign website also cites support for increased funding public education  $100 billion in new housing  and comprehensive immigration reform. But his opponents have zeroed in on several hawkish positions he took  including rejecting the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 and supporting the invasion of Iraq more than a decade before. “You know  I’m pretty progressive myself ” Mr. Engel said in an interview last week from his home in the Bronx. “I have a progressive record down the line for many years in Congress and I’m proud of my record.” Despite the recent successes of some progressive insurgents  it is still extraordinarily difficult to unseat a congressional incumbent in a primary election  this year  only two have fallen  each under unusual circumstances. None Mr. Bowman is hoping that a different sort of circumstances may catapult him to victory. The coronavirus outbreak and civil unrest after Mr. Floyd’s killing complicated the campaign for both candidates  forcing the cancellation of in-person events and fund-raisers. But they also gave Mr. Bowman  who is African-American  a conducive environment to stress the need for change in arenas like criminal justice and health care. Mr. Bowman was recruited by Justice Democrats after education activists in New York suggested he could be a potent candidate with a compelling life story: a childhood in public housing in New York City  followed by years as an educator  culminating with the founding of a middle school in the Bronx  the Cornerstone Academy for Social Action  where he was the founding principal. None “We’ve anchored our race in fighting for racial and economic justice from the very beginning ” Mr. Bowman said in an interview. “And what Covid and now these protests are revealing is  to the rest of the country  is how broken our system is.” The dueling crises also provided Mr. Bowman with a powerful talking point accusing Mr. Engel of not spending enough time in the district  which includes the northern Bronx and portions of southern Westchester County  a mix of well-to-do neighborhoods like Riverdale and poorer areas. Mr. Bowman has repeatedly attacked Mr. Engel’s staying at a home he owns in Maryland during long stretches of the coronavirus virus outbreak  as well as for much of his time in Washington. None This argument seems to befuddle Mr. Engel  who said he bought the Maryland home after he was first elected in 1988 and had two small children at the time. “I work in Washington and he’s going to deny me a place to sleep?” Mr. Engel said  adding  “You can’t stay on the  sleep on the  streets.” As the race has intensified  Mr. Engel has also fought back  pointing out that election records show that Mr. Bowman did not vote in 2012  even as Barack Obama — still the lodestar of many Democratic voters — sought a second term. Mr. Bowman insists that he remembers voting in Manhattan that year  saying “there must be a problem with the records.” “Do you think I wouldn’t vote for the first black president?” he said. Mr. Engel also highlighted how Mr. Bowman only registered as a Democrat in 2018  he was previously registered in the Independence Party. “So he’s not really a Democrat ” Mr. Engel said. None In Hastings-on-Hudson in Westchester  Jim Cullen  57  a self-described moderate Democrat  said he would vote for the incumbent  though he knew his wife and son would vote for Mr. Bowman  saying it was good to “preserve the institutional integrity of the Democratic Party at a time when it’s under tremendous pressure.” But Olivia Lovejoy  40  said she was ready to embrace Mr. Bowman’s message. “I’m thinking we need change ” said Ms. Lovejoy  a customer service representative  adding that Mr. Bowman’s candidacy gave her cause for optimism. “I feel hopeful.” For his part  Mr. Engel seemed well aware of the tentative nature of his political perch. “I never forget for even one moment that this is the people’s seat ” he said. “And not my seat.” Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/politics/bolton-book-congress.html,Bolton Unites Republicans and Democrats in Scorn Over Tell-All Book Advertisement Supported by Democrats slammed the former national security adviser for saving his damning revelations for a book instead of sharing them with impeachment investigators. Republicans hit him for speaking out. None None None Republicans were mad that Mr. Bolton  whose book “The Room Where It Happened” described Mr. Trump’s presidency as a series of actions that amounted to “obstruction of justice as a way of life ” was daring to malign the president. On Capitol Hill  the release of the book appeared only to harden long-calcified views of the president and his conduct. They also reflected a certain institutional hostility to being told how to do their jobs. Mr. Bolton suggested in his book that Congress should have investigated Mr. Trump for his use of trade negotiations and criminal inquiries to further his political interests  far beyond the one episode in which he asked the president of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. “I don’t want to pay money for a book that was a substitute for testifying before Congress about the well-being of the American people ” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. As for impeachment  she said  “I have no regrets — no  I’m very proud of what we did.” To Republicans  Mr. Bolton’s turn against the president meant it was time to turn on Mr. Bolton. “Money drives a lot of people to say a lot of things ” said Representative Kevin McCarthy  Republican of California and the minority leader. “We’ve watched people before make lies about the president.” None None “He sold out the national interest for his personal political interest ” Senator Chuck Schumer  Democrat of New York and the minority leader  said on the Senate floor. “Sound familiar  my Senate Republican colleagues? Sound familiar?” Mr. Schumer called episodes of Mr. Trump’s behavior  as described in the book  “craven” and “revolting.” Nevertheless  he said  “I would have preferred Mr. Bolton to tell these stories under oath at the impeachment trial.” Still  at least some lawmakers who agonized over whether to allow Mr. Bolton and others to be subpoenaed as part of the impeachment trial — and ultimately decided to block the move — said they were not sorry. “I made the decision that I made at the time that I made it ” said Senator Lisa Murkowski  Republican of Alaska. “And  you know  there’s no going back.” “I don’t regret that decision ” she added. (Senator Susan Collins of Maine  who pushed to hear from witnesses but voted to acquit Mr. Trump without hearing from them  hurried away on Thursday from reporters in the Capitol  saying only  “I’m starting to look at it.”) None “He is a guy that obviously is jilted from being in that office ” Senator Mike Braun  Republican of Indiana  told reporters of Mr. Bolton. “And I don’t think it merits comment in the context of what we’re trying to do with police reform and other issues.” Said Senator John Cornyn  Republican of Texas: “I don’t really have any comments about it  because I haven’t read it. I know he’s trying to sell a book.” Mr. Bolton’s book contains some unflattering information about Mr. Trump’s lack of knowledge about basic facts of world affairs and geography. The president did not seem to know that Britain possessed nuclear weapons  Mr. Bolton wrote  or that Finland was not part of Russia. While those accounts prompted some mockery  Democrats mostly seemed frustrated at Mr. Bolton’s refusal to participate in the impeachment inquiry. During the House proceeding  Mr. Bolton declined to appear  joining a lawsuit that sought a decision from a federal judge about whether he should heed Congress’s request for his testimony or a White House order not to participate. Rather than engage in a lengthy court fight  House leaders wrapped up the inquiry in December without him and moved to a vote to impeach Mr. Trump on two counts: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. None “The fact that he wasn’t willing to testify in the House and was willing to tie us up in court for a long time  but willing to tell the story to a book  to make money for a book  tells you a lot about John Bolton’s character ” Representative Adam Schiff of California  the chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence  said on “CBS This Morning.” “Whether his testimony would have made significant difference in trial? It may have led to further evidence and further witnesses  but we will never know. And this is the price the country had to pay for John Bolton putting profit before country.” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia  the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee  said he wished that Mr. Bolton had revealed his story to the panel. “There’s obviously a ton of serious allegations  and I think the American public needs to know if they’re true ” he said. Mr. Warner said he and Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida and the chairman of the committee  were in talks about what steps to take next. Ms. Pelosi  too  said she would be meeting with her committee chairs to “make a judgment” on how to move forward with further oversight  now that Mr. Bolton had made public what he knew. For now  however  members of both parties appeared to have felt they heard more than enough from Mr. Bolton. “President Trump is clearly ethically unfit and intellectually unprepared to be the president of the United States ” Ms. Pelosi said. “That doesn’t seem to matter to the Republicans in the United States Senate. It didn’t seem to matter to John Bolton. He chose loyalty over patriotism.” Advertisement ,articles/politics

None None None Here is what the move means for Hong Kong. None Full details have not been released  but the security law is expected to deter speech  protests and news media critical of the Chinese government  threatening the territory’s independent press and democratic opposition. None None None Legal experts had been uncertain how Mr. Xi could introduce a national security law into Hong Kong without going through the city’s Legislative Council  a body stacked with pro-Beijing members who have  nonetheless  hesitated to take such a contentious step. None None The law will also establish a new security agency in the territory to enforce the security restrictions  and Beijing will create its own separate security arm in Hong Kong  empowered to investigate special cases and collect intelligence  according to a summary issued by China’s legislature. The legislation also gives the territory’s chief official  who must answer to Beijing  the power to decide which judges are empowered to hear trials for state security charges  limiting the autonomy of the city’s judiciary. Carrie Lam  Hong Kong’s local leader  has sought to reassure the public that their “legitimate rights and freedoms” will be safeguarded. She and other politicians who support the law have also said that it will target only a tiny minority of lawbreakers. None None None None None None Taiwan said this month that it would expand efforts to provide refuge to protesters and others who wish to leave Hong Kong. The government said it could  in certain cases  provide work and study visas  as well as assistance securing housing and jobs. Elaine Yu contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/hong-kong-security-law-china.html,How China Scammed Hong Kong Advertisement Supported by It pays to play the long game against people who want to be free. None Mr. Lian is a former chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal. After many years of rejecting the people of Hong Kong’s persistent demands for genuine universal suffrage and other rights  China made its position clear again on Tuesday with the legislative equivalent of a cracking head bash. It chose the eve of July 1  a triple anniversary — of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party (1921)  the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China (1997) and a break-in of the city’s legislature by pro-democracy activists (2019) — to pass a draconian national security law that will forever harm Hong Kong’s political freedoms and hobble its economic relations with the rest of the world. Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China with its own  supposedly independent  executive  legislative and judiciary branches. Yet the new law was proposed in Beijing  drafted in Beijing and promulgated in Beijing. None None None The new law trumps any local laws that are inconsistent with it. A national security commission will be set up in the city  joined by a Beijing-appointed adviser  to oversee the law’s implementation. Its work will not be made public  nor will that be subject to judicial review. The Hong Kong chief executive is to appoint special judges to hear national security cases. The city’s Secretary of Justice may deny a defendant a trial by jury. The ultimate power to interpret the law rests with Beijing. Articles 37 and 38 appear to mean that the law is applicable worldwide — and universally: not only to permanent residents of Hong Kong and entities based in the city while they are abroad  but also to “a person who is not a permanent resident” of Hong Kong who commits an offense from “outside.” Though the law is being called “national security” legislation  its true  bespoke purpose is to suppress the decades-old pro-democracy movement in the city — which has grown more vocal in recent years as repression from Beijing has increased  with some younger people calling for outright independence for Hong Kong. None Politically astute Hong Kongers are only too aware of the Chinese government’s propensity to bring bogus charges against its political opponents. None None None None In their view  President Xi Jinping of China has recently reversed  even betrayed  Deng’s blueprint for Hong Kong. But this is faulty thinking. And it would be simplistic  as well as ultimately dangerous  to think that China has been acting in bad faith only under Mr. Xi today. None Mr. Xi today isn’t betraying Deng’s vision for Hong Kong back then: He is only dutifully carrying that vision forward to what is  some three decades later  its natural  logical culmination. The Basic Law  which was designed in the late 1980s and adopted in 1990  is an inherently cynical document. It was instrumental in ensuring the smooth transfer of sovereignty from Britain in 1997 because it seemed to contain generous guarantees from China  in particular provisions that safeguarded Hong Kongers’ fundamental political liberties and promised to give them more democratic rights in the future. But many observers and major political actors in Hong Kong — including some who helped draft the Basic Law — have consistently overrated its apparent assurances  while overlooking the fact that many of those come with sleeper clauses or caveats that can override them. None None “No department of the Central People’s Government and no province  autonomous region or municipality directly under the Central Government may interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region administers on its own in accordance with this Law.” None Likewise  the first clause of Article 39 says that “the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights” and other rights agreements “as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force.” What if those protections became irksome to Beijing? No problem  there’s Article 160: “Upon the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  the laws previously in force in Hong Kong shall be adopted as laws of the Region except for those which the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress declares to be in contravention of this Law. If any laws are later discovered to be in contravention of this Law  they shall be amended or cease to have force in accordance with the procedure as prescribed by this Law.” And then there’s Article 18. It allows the Standing Committee of China’s rubber-stamping legislative body  the National People’s Congress  to “add to or delete from the list of laws in Annex III” in the name of defense  foreign affairs  national unity or security  “as well as other matters outside the limits of the autonomy” of the city. That annex is a lengthy appendix of laws passed on the mainland that apply in Hong Kong  all exceptionally. None In the 1980s  when people in Hong Kong were worried about their post-1997 future  the Chinese government played up the concessionary parts of the Basic Law. That was the first  the good-looking  stage in a two-stage plan to absorb the city into the mainland’s universe. The inevitable second stage is unfolding today. Now that Hong Kong is under the watchful eye of both Chinese soldiers garrisoned in the city and their newly loyal local cousins — the increasingly violent and politicized Hong Kong police force — Beijing is activating the sleeper clauses of the Basic Law to feather the deathbed of the city’s autonomy. Politicians and thought leaders in Western countries  as well as older members of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement  are only beginning to realize — if they are at all — that for three decades or more they have been reading the Basic Law  and China itself  wrong. They believed that the West  by helping China modernize  would also help it democratize and with that  would be protecting Hong Kong. None And so some of them have called for full autonomy for Hong Kong. Such goals may be unrealistic now — and as of Tuesday  even outright dangerous. But they at least expose China’s decades of deception and put the world on notice.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law-rules.html,New Security Law Gives China Sweeping Powers Over Hong Kong Advertisement Supported by The law  approved in Beijing with speed and secrecy and signed off by Xi Jinping  will tighten the Communist Party’s grip on Hong Kong after last year’s protests.  None China unveiled a contentious new law for Hong Kong late Tuesday that grants the authorities sweeping powers to crack down on opposition to Beijing at home and abroad with heavy prison sentences for vaguely defined political crimes. None The Hong Kong government issued the text of the legislation at 11 p.m. on Tuesday  after weeks of unusual secrecy surrounding the drafting of the law in Beijing. The law took effect immediately  even though the public was seeing it in full only for the first time.  The text provided a far-reaching blueprint for the authorities and the courts to suppress the city’s protest movement and for China’s national security apparatus to pervade many layers of Hong Kong’s society.  Ambiguously worded offenses of separatism  subversion  terrorism and collusion with foreign countries carry maximum penalties of life imprisonment. Inducing residents to hate the government in Beijing or Hong Kong is defined as a serious crime.  A new Committee for Safeguarding National Security will be authorized to operate in total secrecy and be shielded from legal challenges. Its officials will be given the task of scrutinizing schools  corporations  nongovernmental organizations  news companies  and foreigners living in Hong Kong and abroad.  “It’s meant to suppress and oppress  and to frighten and intimidate Hong Kongers ” Claudia Mo  a pro-democracy lawmaker  said. “And they just might succeed in that.” Other key details in the law include: None It allows Beijing to seize broad control in security cases  especially during crises. Suspects in security cases will mostly be held without bail. Trials involving state secrets could be closed to the media and the public  with few rights to trial by jury and with only the verdicts announced. Suspects in important cases can be sent to face trial in mainland China  where courts are opaque and often harsh.  None None None None Breaking from normal procedure  the committee did not release a draft of the law for public comment. Hong Kong’s activists  legal scholars and officials were left to debate or defend the bill based on details released by China’s state news media earlier this month. “The fact that the Chinese authorities have now passed this law without the people of Hong Kong being able to see it tells you a lot about their intentions ” said Joshua Rosenzweig  the head of Amnesty International’s China team. “Their aim is to govern Hong Kong through fear from this point forward.” None “They are doing whatever it takes to crack down on dissent and opposition here. It’s just unthinkable in the year 2020 ” said Ms. Mo  the pro-democracy lawmaker. “This is a huge departure from civilization.” None None Administrators of chat groups used by protesters on Telegram  a popular app  sent messages urging users not to panic but also said that they should purge their devices of data  contacts and photos should they join any future protests.  None “Lung Mun Cafe has more or less accompanied the people of Hong Kong on this ‘path against tyranny ’” Cheung Chun-kit  the owner of the cafe chain  said in a statement posted on Facebook. But he explained that he was pulling out of the yellow economy because “the national security law has made me re-examine my path this year.”  None A few dozen pro-Beijing supporters wearing white shirts and blue caps gathered in a park to celebrate the passage of the law. They celebrated by waving large Chinese flags as they uncorked bottles of sparkling wine and drank from plastic cups. None “The July 1 march tomorrow will show that we will absolutely not accept this evil national security law ” Wu Chi-wai  a pro-democracy lawmaker  said on Tuesday. “Even if they try to crush us  we will use all kinds of ways and methods to ensure that Hong Kong people’s voices and opinions can be expressed.” Austin Ramzy  Elaine Yu and Nick Bruce contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/business/economy/police-unions-labor.html,He Says a Union Fired Him Over His Push for Police Reform Advertisement Supported by A clash at a Maryland local shows the tensions in a labor movement whose ranks include law enforcement officers along with many nonwhite  nonpolice members. None When Gabriel Acevero  a Maryland state legislator employed by a union local  introduced a bill last year to roll back protections for police accused of misconduct  he was stepping on a potential fault line. His union  Local 1994 of the United Food and Commercial Workers  represents thousands of Black and Latino workers in food services and at a variety of government agencies. It also includes a small portion of workers in law enforcement. That fault line turned out to be a chasm that could swallow him up. In mid-June  Mr. Acevero filed a formal charge with the National Labor Relations Board accusing the union of illegally firing him because of his reform advocacy. “The reason why I was terminated ” Mr. Acevero said  “was about legislation.” The union local’s president  Gino Renne  said he fired Mr. Acevero because of his antagonistic attitude at a meeting to discuss the issue. But he also said Mr. Acevero’s stand complicated “our obligation to represent our members.” None This has  in turn  complicated life for thousands of national  state and local labor officials. None While the largest police organization  the Fraternal Order of Police  has only a tenuous relationship with the labor movement  many unions count law enforcement officers among their diverse membership. Leaders of these unions acknowledge the urgency of reform  but fear that distancing themselves from law enforcement colleagues  or limiting their rights  could weaken labor and create pressure to roll back protections for other workers. “We have to be very careful in the labor movement that we don’t stand up and say it’s OK to tell one group of people that they shouldn’t be able to organize ” said Terry Melvin  the secretary-treasurer of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. and president of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists  an international organization. “That’s something that would be a slippery slope if it will open the door for others to come up with reasons that another group should not be able to organize.” Over the past few weeks  the jostling among these interests has produced a mix of awkward compromises  papered-over differences and outright flare-ups  with no resolution in sight. None None “We supported that resolution ” the federation’s president  Richard Trumka  said in an interview  before adding: “We believe that it is not the time to disaffiliate. We believe the best way to use our influence on the issue of police brutality is to engage with police unions.” None Yet just below the national leadership  seams have begun to show. Kyle Bragg  the president of the service employees’ Local 32BJ  which represents tens of thousands of cleaners and other building workers across the Northeast  rejoiced over the recent repeal — over police unions’ objections — of a New York statute that was used to keep officers’ disciplinary records from public view. But he said his largely minority membership wanted lawmakers to go much further. “The blue wall really has to come down ” Mr. Bragg said in an interview. “I don’t have the ability to bargain ‘no penalties  no consequences  no accountability’ for my members if they do something egregious on the job.” The union also supports redirecting “some of the massive spending on policing” to schools  health care and housing  according to a spokeswoman. None “We are constantly talking to our brothers and sisters in those unions about these issues ” he said. “No one has shut a door. Obviously there are issues that law enforcement unions have against some of the more popular demands that are being made nationwide.” The limits of internal labor dialogue have also become apparent. In Seattle  the police union responded to the labor council’s ultimatum with a letter acknowledging that structural racism causes “undue harm” to people of color and promising “to embrace reform and accountability.” The two sides had what was by all accounts an earnest discussion of the problem during a two-and-a-half hour meeting  yet the labor council still voted to expel the police union. None “I said this can never happen in Seattle again ” Ms. Grant recalled. But she said the union head  Mike Solan  interpreted the episode differently. “Solan’s response was that it was tragic  but that it will happen again ” because of human nature  Ms. Grant said. Mr. Solan said in an interview that the death reflected a breakdown of other systems  not policing  and that the police had de-escalated a similar situation involving the same woman two weeks earlier  but that her behavior had remained erratic after a judge released her from custody. “For de-escalation to work  it takes two parties ” he said. “The person on the other end of police interaction has a say in how that interaction goes.” In some ways  the differences between Mr. Acevero  the Maryland lawmaker who was fired from his union position  and his boss at the union  Mr. Renne  proved equally insurmountable. None Later that year  he pushed for similar measures  such as a repeal of the state’s so-called Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights  which provides procedural protections for police accused of misconduct. In December 2019  after Mr. Renne received complaints about Mr. Acevero’s reform advocacy from the head of the local Fraternal Order of Police  and from sheriff’s deputies represented by the food workers’ union  Mr. Renne gathered them all for a meeting to address the concerns. According to contemporaneous notes from one person in attendance  Mr. Renne  a former sheriff’s deputy  told Mr. Acevero he favored a more constructive approach to addressing police misconduct. Torrie Cooke  the local president of the Fraternal Order of Police  said a labor official shouldn’t be promoting anti-labor laws. Both Mr. Acevero and Mr. Cooke are Black. After Mr. Acevero responded that he favored collective bargaining rights but that existing protections shielded “corrupt cops ” the conversation became more heated  according to both men and other participants. Then Mr. Renne abruptly told him he was fired. The two union leaders  Mr. Renne and Mr. Cooke  “were attempting to get me to stop working on that legislation  and I refused ” Mr. Acevero said in an interview. He said that the entire meeting was inappropriate because it was intended to pressure him in his role as a public official  which had nothing to do with his union obligations.  Mr. Cooke  the police union president  said that he played no role in Mr. Acevero’s firing. Mr. Renne said he took the action because of Mr. Acevero’s inappropriate manner at the meeting  not his position on police reform. But he acknowledged that it would have been difficult to continue to employ Mr. Acevero because his advocacy “compromises our position as a union.” Wilma B. Liebman  a former chairwoman of the National Labor Relations Board  said that firing an employee for outside work on police reform could be interpreted as a violation of labor rights. But the burden is on the employee to show how the reform efforts affect work life and conditions  she said. In many ways the incident was a harbinger of the strains to come. Asked how he might balance the escalating demands of his predominantly minority membership for police reform against the anxieties of his law enforcement members  Mr. Renne professed a measure of befuddlement. “It’s a tightrope ” he said  before noting that the country’s current policing model isn’t working. “If you are an exclusive police union  taking a position for or against reform is not as challenging ” Mr. Renne continued. “But when you are a union such as myself and other unions in the labor movement who are not exclusive law enforcement unions  this becomes a much more complex challenge.” Marc Tracy contributed reporting.

Kluge Prize for Achievement in the Study of Humanity  a $500 000 award administered by the Library of Congress that recognizes work in disciplines not covered by the Nobel Prizes. None At the library  she will lead an initiative called “Our Common Purpose ” aimed at engaging educators  the general public and political leaders in promoting what she calls “civic strength.” In a statement  Carla Hayden  the librarian of Congress  said the choice of Dr. Allen would further a “timely national conversation” on how to strengthen American democracy. “Now is an important moment to discuss ways we can all promote civic strength and engagement  which is at the core of our national culture ” Dr. Hayden said. None But 18 months ago  the financial award was scaled back to $500 000  both to make sure it could be given every two years  and to allow the library to devote more resources to public programming around the prize  according to John Haskell  the director of the Kluge Center. None “The Kluge Center is not just a place where really great scholars hang out ” he said. “It’s also supposed to bring scholarship to Congress and the rest of the policymaking world and to the interested public.” None None “I was shocked  at the beginning of Covid-19  how quickly people moved into this way of thinking  ‘Oh  maybe we should just let the elderly go’ or ‘Maybe we should just let young people get it and see what happens ’” she said in an interview. “The willingness to abandon parts of our society is the definition of a broken social compact.” As for the programs at the library (which will be virtual)  she said she hoped they would help rebuild “civic strength ” which she said was as important as economic or foreign policy strength. None “There is a real sense that democracy isn’t delivering what it promises  and that’s disillusioning ” she said. Advertisement ,articles/politics

Advertisement Supported by Worker protections are critical during the pandemic — yet the Trump administration has issued only voluntary guidance instead of enforceable rules. None None As states and municipalities relax shelter-in-place orders  the nation seems to be racing to get the economy back to something resembling the pre-pandemic era. Restaurants  malls  cinemas  day care centers and retail stores are reopening sooner than most medical professionals think is wise. None Yet the federal agency meant to protect America’s workers continues to sit on the sidelines.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/world/asia/hong-kong-china-national-security.html,China Readies Strict Security Law for Hong Kong Advertisement Supported by Chinese lawmakers are discussing legislation that could drastically curtail freedoms in the semiautonomous territory. None None A session of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee — the Communist country’s top legislative body — ends on Saturday  and Hong Kong residents are waiting to learn if the committee will release a draft of the proposed law  or even hastily enact it. None None The new law could deter speech and publications critical of the government  stifling the territory’s free press and democratic opposition. None Beijing  frustrated at the failure of the Hong Kong authorities to enact a national security law on their own  decided to take matters into its own hands. The central government’s decision to impose a law on Hong Kong effectively circumvents the local legislature. Legal experts were uncertain how Mr. Xi could impose a national security law on Hong Kong without going through the city’s Legislative Council  a body stacked with pro-Beijing members who have  nonetheless  hesitated to take such a contentious step. None For safe measure  the congress ordered Hong Kong to introduce its own national security law  meaning the territory could be subject to two laws that potentially overlap or conflict. None None Since Beijing’s announcement in late May  politicians in Hong Kong have debated the law  though very few were included in the central government’s process to draft it. Most Hong Kong lawmakers  like the city’s residents  do not know the exact provisions in the proposed law. None A mainland official suggested this week that Beijing would exercise direct jurisdiction over the most serious national security cases occurring in Hong Kong  meaning residents could be extradited to mainland China for trial. Those remarks caused even some pro-Beijing politicians to voice misgivings. Carrie Lam  Hong Kong’s leader  has sought to reassure the public that the “legitimate rights and freedoms” of citizens would be safeguarded  while criticizing opponents for “demonizing” the law. But even she admitted to not knowing exactly what the law will include. As China has moved forward with plans to impose tougher security laws in Hong Kong  many world leaders have criticized the decision. None None None Taiwan said on Thursday that it would expand efforts to provide refuge to protesters and others who wish to leave Hong Kong. The government said it could  in certain cases  provide work and study visas  as well as assistance securing housing and jobs.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/opinion/tiananmen-protest-china.html,Tiananmen’s Other Children Advertisement Supported by Past protests actually are remembered in China — and commemorated with yet more protests. None Ms. Carter and Mr. Carter are political scientists. None The Tiananmen Square protests were the culmination of China’s long-running pro-democracy movement — and the massacre marked a peak of government repression. None Has it succeeded? None We  instead  demonstrate that Chinese people remember Tiananmen and other democracy movements and commemorate them  especially on anniversaries  with yet more forms of protests  despite the government’s extraordinary efforts to erase or rewrite the historical record. None Since today the C.C.P. is quick to repress any explicit demands for democracy or individual rights  open calls of that kind hardly occur. Nonetheless  there is a clear lineage between all these surges of contestation  and it is apparent from the calendar of protests — and the party’s calendar of repression — as well as the language used on protest days. In addition to the Tiananmen Square movement  four other major occasions have informed this schedule. And our statistical work reveals that there are 30 percent more protests on the anniversaries marking those moments than on other days of the year  and that protest spikes (defined as an increase of one standard deviation over the average) are 50 percent more common on those days. In the late 1970s  Deng launched a program of economic liberalization  including the so-called “four modernizations” in agriculture  industry  defense and science and technology. Hoping for political reform as well  in 1978 citizens throughout the country began putting up pro-democracy posters in public places  including in one spot in central Beijing that came to be known as “Democracy Wall.” None In December 1986  university students rallied behind the public intellectual Fang Lizhi’s call that the C.C.P. treat the rights mentioned in China’s Constitution as “actual rights.” Tens of thousands of students protested at 150 universities and asked to directly elect representatives to the National People’s Congress. The government agreed to some demands and the students disbanded  then the government mostly reneged. None None None None None Today  after years of repression  protests tend to be less openly referential  and they employ more indirect language as a stand-in or proxy for democratic resistance. None None None None The scale of many of these protests might seem small for a country of 1.4 billion people today. But the C.C.P.  for one  takes them seriously. In our statistical analysis  we have found that the government represses protests that take place on anniversaries of pro-democracy movements twice as often as protests held on other days. The legacy of Tiananmen  like that of other protests before it and since  lives on. Contestation persists in mainland China  if cautiously and in code. None None None Advertisement ,articles/politics

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/economy/coronavirus-china-economy.html,China  Faced With Challenges  Mounts Show of Strength at Congress Session Advertisement Supported by Beijing broke with precedent in abandoning an annual growth target for 2020  a sign of the difficulties of restarting its economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. None None None On the economy  the premier  addressing the opening of the National People’s Congress  declared that the government had achieved a “decisive victory” against the coronavirus outbreak and that the country has shown great resilience. But in a break with tradition  China abandoned setting an annual growth target for 2020  recognizing the difficulties in restarting its economy amid a pandemic. By embracing the challenges ahead  China’s leaders provided a call to the world that the party was emerging confidently from both crises with a greater resolve to defend its authority. None Premier Li Keqiang  who is second-ranked in the Communist Party hierarchy behind Mr. Xi  made his speech to nearly 3 000 congress delegates who wore masks as they sat in neat rows in the ornate Great Hall of the People. He pledged to help blunt the impact of the slowdown with goals to limit inflation and unemployment. “At present and for some time to come  China will face challenges like never before ” he said. “However  we have unique political and institutional strengths  a strong economic foundation  enormous market potential and hundreds of millions of intelligent and hardworking people.” “The horizons for China’s development are full of promise ” Mr. Li said. None None “Law-based and forceful measures must be taken to prevent  stop and punish such activities ” Mr. Wang declared  as delegates in the hall burst into applause. Beijing’s security plans drew immediate alarm  including in the Hong Kong stock market  which slumped more than 5 percent on Friday. The annual congress  which usually convenes in early March for about two weeks  had been delayed and shortened to a week this year because of the coronavirus crisis. None The unusual arrangements for the congress meeting this year reflect continued worries that China has not totally contained the outbreak. Most journalists have practically no access to the events  and must instead follow proceedings and join news conferences over video links. Delegates have been required to undergo nucleic acid tests for the virus before they are even allowed to travel to Beijing. None Premier Li’s budget proposal calls for a stimulus program equal to just around 2 percent of the country’s economic output last year.  Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent  after it hit 14.7 percent in April  which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None China’s top financial planners have been leery of having the government borrow yet more money now to hand out checks to the public the way governments in the United States  Hong Kong and elsewhere have done. Debt-fueled stimulus programs helped the Chinese economy rebound quickly from the global financial crisis a decade ago but left the country burdened with debt and awash in wasteful projects. Mr. Li announced instead a series of small measures that are likely to be popular but will have a modest cost. He said that the government would cut the cost of broadband internet access this year by 15 percent. And he said that the government would increase its subsidies for basic medical insurance for some residents — but only by a little over $4 a year per person. Mr. Li emphasized that despite the economic slowdown  there would be no retreat from eradicating rural poverty by the end of this year  a goal that Mr. Xi has made a pillar of his man-of-the-people image. Military spending will also continue to grow  with budget documents released by Mr. Li saying that it would increase by 6.6 percent this year even as overall central government spending is slated to fall 0.2 percent. Mr. Li sought to reassure domestic and foreign investors that China remains committed to shifting away from central planning toward a greater reliance on markets. He did not address recent trends that have pointed to the contrary  such as the sharp shift by the state-controlled banking system toward more loans to state-owned enterprises instead of private enterprises. He reaffirmed China’s commitment to the phase 1 trade agreement with the United States. The deal has allowed the United States to retain a wide range of tariffs on Chinese goods while China resumes buying a lot of American pork and other farm products. Because of the pandemic  China has fallen far behind that agreement’s targets for imports of American manufactured goods and energy. Mr. Li did not directly speak to tensions with the Trump administration  which has accused Beijing of delays and cover-ups that allowed the outbreak to expand into a pandemic. China has maintained that it acted quickly and transparently and Mr. Li signaled that China would continue to promote itself as a responsible partner in the global health crisis. At the same time  he included a rare admission that China had made mistakes in handling the pandemic. “Many weak links have been exposed in public health emergency management ” he said  “and the people have expressed their views and suggestions  which deserve our attention.” Wang Yiwei  Amber Wang  Liu Yi and Claire Fu contributed research.

Security Council Advertisement Supported by Canada lost  again  in a three-way race for two of the vacant seats on the 15-member council  the most powerful U.N. body. None Diplomats at the United Nations chose Mexico  India  Ireland and Norway in elections held Wednesday to fill upcoming vacancies on the Security Council  the most powerful authority in the 193-member global organization  which turns 75 years old this October. Canada  which competed in a three-way race with Norway and Ireland for two of the vacancies  failed to gain the minimum 128 votes required. Norway won 130 and Ireland 128. Mexico and India ran unopposed for the vacant seats allocated to their geographic regions. Five of the 10 nonpermanent seats in the 15-member council were up for election to two-year terms  starting Jan. 1. Results for one of the seats  representing the Africa region  was a tossup between Kenya and Djibouti  with neither receiving the required minimum. A second round of voting to decide the winner was set for Thursday. None The elections were conducted under stringent rules this year for the first time because of the coronavirus pandemic  which has left much of the United Nations headquarters complex in New York closed to all but essential workers at least through July. Ambassadors who ordinarily would congregate in the General Assembly hall for the voting were instead admitted a few at a time in a staggered system  dropping secret ballots in a box and leaving. A seat on the Security Council is considered a coveted honor in international diplomacy. Council members have a prominent voice on issues of peace and security  including the wars in Syria  Yemen and Afghanistan  the nuclear weapons harbored by North Korea  the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  and armed extremist groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. The council’s resolutions are binding  even if many go unenforced. It also is the only U.N. body authorized to approve the use of military force  and is empowered to refer cases of genocide and other crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court for prosecution. Nonetheless  the council has been chronically paralyzed over the years by deep divisions  frequently pitting two of the permanent members  Russia and China  against their Western counterparts  Britain  France and the United States. Unlike nonpermanent members  the so-called P-5 have veto power to defeat resolutions they deem objectionable. None Advertisement ,articles/politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/opinion/trump-cotton-military-floyd-protests.html,Trump Is Waiting to Take ‘Law and Order’ Into His Own Hands Advertisement Supported by The president threatens to bring a particularly authoritarian brand of executive power to American cities. None The authors are federal public defenders. American history is littered with ugly examples of politicians using national crises to erode civil liberties. This time is no different. President Trump and Attorney General William Barr have been threatening to bring a particularly authoritarian brand of executive power to the streets of American cities. And although civil unrest in many American cities now appears to be diminishing  Mr. Trump has given notice that he may yet take matters into his own hands. None None What’s alarming  indeed  frightening  about the president’s and attorney general’s threat to make use of these laws is plain: They convey to Mr. Trump nearly limitless power to use the military and Justice Department to police heated matters of public concern. None None Ordering active-duty troops to police American cities  Mr. Esper said  should be a “last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations” and said that for now  it was not warranted. And his predecessor in that job  James Mattis  a retired Marine general  warned on Wednesday: “Militarizing our response  as we witnessed in Washington  D.C.  sets up a conflict — a false conflict — between the military and civilian society. It erodes the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect  and of which they themselves are a part.” But if this week’s use of chemical gas and force on peaceful demonstrators to clear the way for President Trump to have his photo taken holding a Bible in front of St. John’s Church in Washington portends anything  it is that we should be worried how  and where  the president will draw that line. None None Instead of addressing poverty and institutional racism  which the commission had identified as the underlying causes of the riots  this new version of the Anti-Riot Act aimed to stop riots before they started. The law targeted “outside agitators” who were teaching  preaching and urging nonviolent civil disobedience. It was no secret that it was aimed at the “communists” of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and potentially even the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. himself. None “Potentially ” they continued  “this law is the foundation for a police state in America.” They were correct then  and they are correct now. The Anti-Riot Act is vast and sweeps within its reach significant amounts of protected First Amendment speech and assembly. The history of prosecutions under the law include the Chicago Eight protesters at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago (whose convictions were all overturned on appeal) and antiwar protesters at the Republican National Convention in 1972 (all acquitted at trial). John Lennon was under investigation (never charged) for possible violations of the Anti-Riot Act because of his association with a group known as the Election Year Strategy Information Center. The law was also used to try to force members of the Black Panther Party and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War to testify before federal grand juries. It has re-emerged in recent years  though under a constitutional shadow. The most recent revival of the law  in 2018  involved federal prosecutions of the Rise Above Movement  a self-identified white nationalist group  after a confrontation with civil rights demonstrators in Charlottesville  Va.  in 2017. In California  a federal judge found the law in its entirety “unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment.” The case is on appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. But law was upheld by a federal judge in Virginia. The defendants pleaded guilty while preserving the right to argue the constitutionality before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  where we were appointed to represent one of the defendants. The appeals court is likely to rule soon on whether all or part of the law survives constitutional muster. None This cuts multiple ways. If you have tweeted support for the protesters in Minneapolis or Richmond or Atlanta  you have most likely violated the Anti-Riot Act. If you tweeted support for the armed protesters urging Michigan’s governor to reopen the state during the Covid-19 lockdown  you most likely violated the Anti-Riot Act. You’re unlikely to be prosecuted  but that doesn’t mean you couldn’t be or that your computer couldn’t be searched for evidence of your associations or what else you have done online. Together these laws create a nearly limitless federal authority to police matters of public concern. As General Mattis put it: “We must reject any thinking of our cities as a ‘battlespace’ that our uniformed military is called upon to ‘dominate.’” States are abundantly equipped to respond to violence and looting when it breaks out. And if they need help  they can call in the National Guard or rely on long-established portions of the Insurrection Act to request federal assistance. The current unrest started with abuse of law-enforcement authority. We must be on guard for an expansion of that authority now  as we know from history that over-criminalization and racism travel together. None None None Advertisement ,articles/politics

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-coronavirus-china.html,Hong Kong Police Fire Tear Gas as Protesters Resist China’s Grip Advertisement Supported by Marchers defied social distancing rules and a water cannon to demonstrate against Beijing’s plan for new security legislation in the territory. None None None While the protesters were largely peaceful  periodic clashes left the area choked with haze and littered with broken glass  furniture and police tape. The police patrolled the district’s main thoroughfare with a water cannon  escorted by an armored truck with two officers seated on top  pointing guns loaded with rubber bullets. None None None “I keep coming out to protest ” said one attendee  Hanna Ng  16. “Bad things keep happening  but I don’t know what else to do.” Crowds began forming around 1 p.m.  as hundreds of people milled beneath the gleaming facades of Causeway Bay  Hong Kong’s biggest shopping district. Ignoring police warnings about the city’s social distancing regulations  which prohibit public gatherings of more than eight people  the protesters taunted police officers  hoisted signs denouncing the Chinese Communist Party and sang “Glory to Hong Kong ” the unofficial anthem of the democracy movement. Several protesters waved flags calling for Hong Kong independence — a call that  though still considered fringe  has gained some traction in recent months as anger at Beijing has grown. As the crowd thickened  trams sat immobilized on the rails  with passengers poking their phones out to record the activity. One protester jammed traffic cones under the tires of a minibus to prevent it from moving. None The result was several hours of start-and-stop encounters  with long stretches of tense quiet interrupted by sudden bouts of police officers’ sprinting down a street  firing pepper balls or tear gas to clear the way. At times  they fired pepper spray in close range of protesters and journalists  according to videos on social media. The police said in a statement that they had deployed tear gas to disperse protesters who blocked traffic and threw umbrellas  water bottles and other objects at officers. “Some rioters have set fire to debris and hurled glass bottles from rooftops  causing danger to residents and business owners nearby ” the police said  adding that protesters had charged into roads  removed street barriers and damaged traffic lights. None None Still  the clashes were relatively restrained  compared to violent clashes that marked the later months of protests last year. None But after the security push was announced  the event took on added urgency for protesters eager to show they would not be cowed. “I came out today to protest against the evil law China will impose on Hong Kong ” Billy Lai  a 34-year-old social worker  said. “If everyone of us can do a little bit more  I hope we can bring changes to the society.” Ricky Chun  a retiree  said he had not planned to attend Sunday’s march when it was first announced. But after the national security push  he knew he had to attend. “This is the only way we can express ourselves ” he said. “We cannot just keep ourselves quiet and take whatever they give to us.” In Beijing  China’s foreign minister  Wang Yi  said that the protests that roiled Hong Kong for much of last year had posed a grave threat to national security  demonstrating that such legislation was long overdue. “We must get it done without the slightest delay ” he said at a news briefing. He sought to assuage concerns that the rules would be used as cover for squelching antigovernment dissent in the city  saying that the move targeted a “very narrow category” of acts. “Instead of becoming unnecessarily worried  people should have more confidence in Hong Kong’s future ” he said. In a statement on Sunday evening  an unnamed spokesperson for the Hong Kong government called the protesters “thugs” and the clashes “atrocities.” The day’s events confirmed ”the necessity and urgency of national security legislation ” the statement said. The Hong Kong government previously tried to introduce security laws in 2003 but backpedaled after mass protests. The city’s government has since avoided reintroducing such legislation  and Beijing’s move signaled its impatience with its local proxies. It remains unclear how the protest movement will move forward  and whether it will able to replicate last year’s victories. Though the protesters in 2019 forced the Hong Kong government to withdraw the extradition bill  many said the aggressiveness of the Communist Party’s actions had dimmed their faith in the power of protest. In addition  even as the coronavirus pandemic has waned in Hong Kong  some in the pro-democracy camp have said they prefer to express their discontent in potentially safer ways  such as boycotting businesses seen as sympathetic to Beijing. Still  those who attended the march said protesting remained one of the most viable options. “I wouldn’t use optimistic ” Michelle Chung  45  a theater artist  said of her outlook on the protests. “But I would say that if we do not insist  we will not see hope. It’s because we insist  that hope will remain out there.” Ezra Cheung  Elaine Yu and Katherine Li contributed reporting. Advertisement ,articles/politics

None Angela Alvarado  a veteran prosecutor in the Santa Clara district attorney’s office in California  has to weigh safety  freedom and the law as she fields complaints about stay-at-home violations. None Supported by None LOS ALTOS  Calif. — A veteran prosecutor in Northern California has turned her kitchen table into an improvised command post where she is enforcing Santa Clara County’s strict lockdown order. Monitoring two computers and a cellphone  Angela Alvarado  the prosecutor  must balance individual rights with infection control every time an email alert notifies her of another complaint: None None None Ms. Alvarado  who is part of a team of lawyers dedicated to monitoring and responding to complaints  hates having to decide whether rabbit lovers can gather to trim bunny nails. (She said maybe.) She hates having to rule on whether people can play tennis or take flying lessons. (She said no  and no.) She cannot believe how many hours she has spent tangling with a local BMW dealer over the question of whether test drives are legal right now. (She has held firm on no.) “At first  it was like  ‘Oh  this is cool  this is exciting ’” she said. “Now I’m like  this is heart-wrenching. Like I’m — I’m over it.” She said she has reached the point where it is a relief when complaints come in with too little information for her to take any action. “I don’t feel comfortable being in that position of saying  ‘You know  your constitutional rights don’t really matter right now ’ but I’ve had to ” she said. “Right now we’re putting parts of the Constitution on hold. We really are. Freedom of assembly. Right to practice religion.” It is a remarkable acknowledgment from a woman who has spent 21 years upholding the law in Santa Clara County. But the law  she said  seemed so much clearer when her work mostly involved prosecuting sex offenders. “This isn’t prosecuting a bad guy ” she said. “This is prosecuting a place I get my coffee. It’s not fun choices to make here.” The complaints keep pouring in  hundreds every week  and so Ms. Alvarado  47  sits at her sunny kitchen table making choices  figuring out which complaints are serious enough to dispatch police officers to confront business owners and  if necessary  threaten them with citations if they do not comply with the county’s shelter-in-place rules. The email inbox chimes yet again. “That’s the sound of doom  right there ” she said  chuckling. As she evaluates complaints  her two children play in a back room. A poster made by her 8-year-old daughter is taped to a window so it faces the street. It depicts a teddy bear holding a heart. “Stay home  save lives ” her daughter wrote in bright colors across the top  succinctly summarizing the point of this strange exercise. None None “They were ahead of the game in terms of reacting  trying to figure out what the heck to do with this pandemic ” Nancy O’Malley  president of the California District Attorneys Association  said of Santa Clara County’s prosecutors. But with protests and legal challenges against lockdown orders now erupting all over the country  Ms. Alvarado offers a glimpse at the growing discomfort felt among those responsible for enforcing orders that so plainly deprive their fellow citizens of bedrock freedoms. The discomfort extends to her boss  Jeff Rosen  the district attorney for Santa Clara County  who described his deep reluctance to actually prosecute anyone for violating the lockdown order. “I didn’t become D.A. to put people out of business ” he said. “But lives are at stake.” None Mr. Rosen has instructed his team to avoid issuing citations except in cases of intentional defiance. He would prefer to use what he calls “soft power” — persuading without prosecuting. Usually it works. But not always. On the day the shelter-in-place order took effect  residents complained to police officers in the city of Mountain View that there were long lines outside Eddy’s Shooting Sports  a gun shop sandwiched between a barber shop and a nail salon in a strip mall. Officers visited the shop that day and told the owner to close. He refused. That is when Ms. Alvarado got involved. The county threatened a misdemeanor charge that carries a $1 000 fine and potential six months imprisonment. Eddy’s closed. “This public health order is in response to an emergency in an extreme crisis  and a lot of constitutional rights have been altered or changed or constrained in some sense because of this ” Mr. Rosen explained. Eddy’s begs to differ. It has joined with other gun shops and the National Rifle Association in a lawsuit that argues local officials cannot “use a public health crisis as political cover to impose bans and restrictions on rights they do not like.” The county created a hotline so that anyone could report lockdown violations  and the calls have come in by the thousands. “We have a ‘United Silicon Valley’ of snitches making sure that we all take this burden together ” Ms. Alvarado said with a mixture of appreciation and dark humor. There is a new complaint about a restaurant doing renovations  and another about people playing soccer  and another about a weight-lifting club that will not close. She fields yet another report about the latest cottage industry — people running barbershops out of their garages. “No one is feeling the pain more than me about not having a haircut and a pedicure ” she said  pointing to the dark brown roots of her dyed-blonde hair. “I mean look at what is happening up here.” Far trickier  she said  was a confrontation on Easter Sunday with Southridge Church of San Jose. The church’s pastor  Micaiah Irmler  came up with the idea of inviting parishioners to celebrate in the safety of their cars at a local drive-in movie theater. When Ms. Alvarado nixed that plan  the congregation instead arranged to distribute 500 bags of food and other items like toilet paper and homemade masks to parishioners who showed up at the drive-in. The idea was to exploit the exemption for those who provide essential services like food delivery. The fact that parishioners might hear Pastor Irmler deliver an Easter sermon over a loudspeaker was incidental. Or so the members of Southridge Church hoped. Ms. Alvarado was not having it. She instructed the police to put an end to Pastor Irmler’s sermon to a sea of parked cars. She did make one accommodation  though: She permitted a drive-through line  so the bags of groceries could be distributed. “These decisions are heavy ” Ms. Alvarado said  summing up her work since March. “They’re taxing.” Katey Rusch and Casey Smith are students at the University of California  Berkeley  Graduate School of Journalism.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/world/europe/coronavirus-governments-power.html,For Autocrats  and Others  Coronavirus Is a Chance to Grab Even More Power Advertisement Supported by Leaders around the world have passed emergency decrees and legislation expanding their reach during the pandemic. Will they ever relinquish them? None None None Governments and rights groups agree that these extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. States need new powers to shut their borders  enforce quarantines and track infected people. Many of these actions are protected under international rules  constitutional lawyers say. But critics say some governments are using the public health crisis as cover to seize new powers that have little to do with the outbreak  with few safeguards to ensure that their new authority will not be abused. The laws are taking swift hold across a broad range of political systems — in authoritarian states like Jordan  faltering democracies like Hungary  and traditional democracies like Britain. And there are few sunset provisions to ensure that the powers will be rescinded once the threat passes. “We could have a parallel epidemic of authoritarian and repressive measures following close if not on the heels of a health epidemic ” said Fionnuala Ni Aolain  the United Nations Special Rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights. As the new laws broaden state surveillance  allow governments to detain people indefinitely and infringe on freedoms of assembly and expression  they could also shape civic life  politics and economies for decades to come. None None Israel’s prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  has authorized his country’s internal security agency to track citizens using a secret trove of cellphone data developed for counterterrorism. By tracing people’s movements  the government can punish those who defy isolation orders with up to six months in prison. None None “This limitless grant of emergency powers is tantamount to autocracy ” a Philippine rights group  the Concerned Lawyers for Civil Liberties  said in a statement. The lawyers noted that Mr. Duterte had once compared the country’s Constitution to a “scrap of toilet paper.” Some states are using the pandemic to crack down on dissent. In Jordan  after an emergency “defense law” gave wide latitude to his office  Prime Minister Omar Razzaz said his government would “deal firmly” with anyone who spreads “rumors  fabrications and false news that sows panic.” Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand has assumed the authority to impose curfews and censor the news media. Journalists there have been sued and intimidated for criticizing the government’s response to the outbreak. None None None None Rights groups say governments may continue to absorb more power while their citizens are distracted. They worry that people may not recognize the rights they have ceded until it is too late to reclaim them. Some emergency bills were waved through so quickly that lawmakers and rights groups had no time to read them  let alone debate their necessity. Rights advocates have also questioned the speed with which states have drafted lengthy legislation. Certain governments have a set of desired powers “ready to go” in case of emergency or crisis  said Ms. Aolain  the United Nations special rapporteur. They draft laws in advance and wait “for the opportunity of the crisis to be presented ” she said. It is far from clear what will become of the emergency laws when the crisis passes. In the past  laws enacted in a rush  like the Patriot Act that followed the Sept. 11 attacks  have outlived the crises they were meant to address. None “It’s really easy to construct emergency powers ” Mr. Rutzen said. “It’s really difficult to deconstruct them.” The pandemic may be a boon to governments with an autocratic bent. In Hungary  a new law has granted Prime Minister Viktor Orban the power to sidestep Parliament and suspend existing laws. Mr. Orban  who declared a state of emergency this month  now has the sole power to end the emergency. Parliament  where two-thirds of the seats are controlled by his party  approved the legislation on Monday. Critics say the new legislation could allow Mr. Orban’s government to further erode democratic institutions and persecute journalists and members of the opposition. The law will permanently amend two articles of the criminal code that will further limit freedom of expression and penalize people for breaching quarantine orders. It will also suspend all elections and referendums. Under one measure  anyone who disseminates information that could hinder the government’s response to the epidemic could face up to five years in prison. The legislation gives broad latitude to the public prosecutor to determine what counts as distorted or false information. “The draft law is alarming ” said Daniel Karsai  a lawyer in Budapest who said the new legislation had created “a big fear” among Hungarians that “the Orban administration will be a real dictatorship.” “There is not enough trust in the government in this respect ” he said. Others pointed to the government’s track record of prolonging emergency legislation long after a crisis. One such decree  issued at the height of Europe’s migration crisis five years ago  is still in effect. Robust democracies are also using the pandemic to expand their power. Britain has a long history of democracy and well-established democratic customs. Nevertheless  a coronavirus bill that was rushed through Parliament at a breakneck pace affords government ministries the power to detain and isolate people indefinitely  ban public gatherings including protests  and shut down ports and airports  all with little oversight. Introducing the bill in Parliament  the health secretary  Matt Hancock  called it “a departure from the way that we do things in peacetime.” He said the measures would be “strictly temporary and proportionate to the threat that we face.” But some of the provisions — called Henry VIII powers  after the notorious 16th-century monarch — will give the government unchecked control. The legislation gives sweeping powers to border agents and the police  which could lead to indefinite detention and reinforce “hostile environment” policies against immigrants  critics said. “Each clause could have had months of debate  and instead it’s all being debated in a few days ” said Adam Wagner  a lawyer who advises a parliamentary committee on human rights. “Everybody’s been trying just to read it  let alone properly critique it ” he said of the legislation  which runs to 340 pages. “These are eye-watering powers that would have not been really imaginable in peacetime in this country before ” said Silkie Carlo  the director of Big Brother Watch  a rights group. She called the measures “draconian.” Ms. Carlo fears that Britain will “swing from crisis to crisis  health panic to health panic  and then find that we’ve lost.” “We risk easily finding ourselves in a perpetual state of emergency ” she said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/14/dining/cooking/the-assembly.html,The Assembly Advertisement Supported by Lasagna  The final key to a great lasagna is to use real  quality Parmesan cheese  most preferably the genuine  imported variety known as Parmigiano-Reggiano. You can find it in most quality grocery stores and Italian shops and delis. It's best to just grate as much as you need.   1 recipe béchamel sauce   1 recipe ragu Bolognese   1 recipe fresh noodles   Parmesan cheese as needed   Butter (for dish and dotting).   1. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees.   2. Butter an ovenproof baking dish (9 inches by 13 inches) and spread a very thin layer of the béchamel on the bottom.   3. Line the bottom with the pasta pieces covering the whole surface of the dish without overlapping.   4. Spread a thin layer of the béchamel over the pasta  then a very thin layer of the ragu  followed by a sprinkling of grated cheese. Repeat with another layer of pasta  béchamel  Bolognese and parmesan. Keep repeating the layers until you are 6-8 layers thick. Top with a thin spread of béchamel and cheese. You can refrigerate the lasagna at this point for up to 2 days.   5. Dot the top with a few pieces of butter and bake for 10 to 15 minutes. There should be a golden crust forming on top. If you do not see a crust forming after 5 minutes turn the oven up to 450 degrees. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.  Advertisement ,articles/politics
