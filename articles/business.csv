What they did and how they did it was as varied as their businesses. None To paraphrase a line from the real estate industry  small businesses  hit by the economic impact of the coronavirus  have had to pivot  pivot  pivot to survive. Many have made adjustments to the way they conduct their businesses — or have shifted their approaches entirely. In the face of a truly catastrophic financial environment  they have used the creativity that spurred them forward as entrepreneurs to adapt to a business environment no one could have foreseen. And they have done these things under the stress of laying off employees  shutting down offices or having to give up on their dream entirely. Financial ruin was a distinct possibility and may still be for many small businesses that are barely holding on. But their goal is the same: to continue their dream  to do what they had been doing on their own terms before the world changed abruptly. They want to own their future as they had owned their past. What they have done — and how they are still doing it — is as varied as the businesses themselves.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/politics/small-business-loans-extended.html,Congress Extends Small-Business Loan Program for 5 Weeks Advertisement Supported by The House cleared the extension  which would give companies more time to apply for pandemic relief loans  sending it to the White House for President Trump’s signature. None None None The program shuttered on Tuesday with more than $130 billion in unspent loan money  after allocating $520 billion in loans to nearly 5 million businesses nationwide. But just hours before  senators unexpectedly reached agreement for a five-week extension. The House cleared it on Wednesday afternoon without a formal vote. Representative Angie Craig  Democrat of Minnesota  who oversaw the measure’s passage on the floor  said lawmakers needed to set aside partisan politics and listen to small-business owners. “Our communities deserve our commitment that their best interests are what is driving our legislation ” she said in a statement.  After the vote  Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California urged the Senate to take up House legislation that would extend the program through December and called on the administration to release information about who had benefited from the program. “The administration’s breathtaking lack of transparency continues to raise serious questions as to why the administration is failing to ensure this lifeline reaches the small businesses in our most impacted communities ” Ms. Pelosi said in a statement. But a much broader and more polarized clash between Republicans and Democrats over whether to extend an array of other assistance programs set to lapse this summer — such as enhanced unemployment benefits that expire at the end of July — will wait until later in the month  with both chambers slated to leave Washington for the Fourth of July and not fully return for two weeks. “It’s certainly something to celebrate ” said Senator Chuck Schumer  Democrat of New York and the minority leader. “But I would have hoped that our two parties could have worked this out before last night  as a small part of much broader legislation to address the many challenges posed by Covid-19.” None Divisions remain over what should be included in future legislation  including how to address the Paycheck Protection Program  administered by the Small Business Administration  which allows companies to have their loans forgiven if they maintain payrolls at a certain level. The program enjoys bipartisan support  but it had a chaotic start and has drawn criticism both for criteria that were regarded as too broad — loans went to large  publicly traded firms — and rules that recipients said were too restrictive  barring them for using the money for their most pressing needs. Small businesses  desperate for relief after closing their doors to slow the spread of the coronavirus  flooded the administration with applications  prompting Congress to inject an additional $320 billion in April. Two months later  lawmakers cleared a series of modifications to relax the terms of the program  including giving small businesses more time to spend the loan money. But without Congress’s action on Wednesday  the window for applying for the loans would remain shut. None Democrats have proposed extending the application window for the program through December and allowing certain small businesses to apply for a second loan  provided that they could show they had used all or most of their initial loan and that they had lost substantial revenue. Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  said on Tuesday that he preferred using some of the remaining funds in the program to provide a second round of assistance to small businesses. “Our hope is that we can use that as the sort of foundation for building a second round of assistance in a more targeted way ” he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/business/coronavirus-great-recession-2008-lessons.html,Small Businesses Repurpose Lessons From the 2008 Recession Advertisement Supported by Small Business: Owning the Future “While every recession is different  as in 2008  small businesses today must focus on adaptability and prepare for timid consumers.” None None In late 2008  as unemployment soared and consumer spending plummeted  the restaurateur Karl Franz Williams opened a stylish  low-lit cocktail lounge on a gentrifying stretch of Frederick Douglass Boulevard in lower Harlem. None None None None None “Small businesses simply have far fewer cash resources and liquid assets on hand compared to large corporations ” says Michael Chow  lead data analyst and economist at the N.F.I.B. “While every recession is different  as in 2008  small businesses today must focus on adaptability and prepare for timid consumers.” As Mr. Chow suggests  flexibility — both in product lines and operational structure — will help vulnerable businesses survive. The key  owners and analysts say  is listening to customers and anticipating their needs  both today and after the pandemic. None Mr. Taylor said that from March 30 to May 30  demand for Levain breads  for example  grew by 150 percent as customers avoided major supermarkets out of coronavirus fears. Having had so few products to manage  he added  the company was able to easily quadruple its bread production in just a matter of days. The giftable nature of Levain cookies also prompted the company to invest early in a robust e-commerce business  which has increased by 200 percent during the pandemic. None Mr. van Wyck has learned the sentiment lesson and is assuming that his business will suffer long after lockdowns end. “Unlike in 2008  we now understand that even when people are able to splash out on events again  there is no guarantee they will actually want to ” said Mr. van Wyck  whose company is staying busy by producing virtual events as well as a line of celebratory cocktail mixers. “We are structuring our business as if there will be no cash flow until December  while simultaneously preparing for the consequences of a second wave.” Along with flexibility  technology — as well as strong lines of credit — will also help determine which companies survive after the coronavirus. “Technology is essential for creating stopgap measures until companies gradually reopen ” said Augustine Faucher  chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group. “Companies need to give their customers a reason to come back to them.” None Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent  after it hit 14.7 percent in April  which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None Opting for cloud services was an unusual move back then. “Smaller-sized companies typically created their own systems  but we realized we could benefit from all that technological R.&D. as it came online ” Mr. Galli Zugaro said. “Today  cloud services are allowing our entire business to run remotely with automated mechanisms in place to clearly measure company performance and employee productivity.” None “We’ve never had ‘No. 2s’ or multiple managers at the company ” Mr. Avigad said. “Israel is the kind of place where every two years there’s a political crisis or mini-war  so beyond recessions or corona  businesses here must retain the ability to shrink or grow rapidly.” Still  Mr. Avigad added that this did not necessarily mean simply hiring and firing at will. “Costs must be contained as cleverly as possible  for us this can mean combining jobs — perhaps having the front-desk manager also become a reservations manager.” None Indika closed its Los Angeles office in late 2008  “because it involved not just the office itself  but also the cost of the travel  the cars  the digital connections between the offices in a pre-broadband world ” said Mr. Mathur  whose firm develops advertising and strategic marketing campaigns for movie studios  television channels and digital platforms. Indika’s New York office was also downsized  and unnecessary recurring expenses — multiple phone lines  special stationery  water delivery services — were eliminated. “As the economy recovered  some of our old habits did return  but we were better prepared for this crisis because we had already significantly lowered nonessential expenses ” during the last recession  Mr. Mathur said. Back in Harlem  67 Orange Street is still open  with take-out and delivery menus  along with take-home cocktail kits for purchase. As for Mr. Williams  he is back where he started — behind his bar preparing drinks and keeping a close eye on operations. “I worked the bar half of the time during those early lean years ” said Mr. Williams. “Now I’m there two days a week  not only does it reduce overhead  but I’m extremely close to what is happening with the business so I can manage costs and immediately figure out the best ways to pivot.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/malaysian-restaurant-azalina-pandemic.html,Food That’s a Business and a Comfort Advertisement Supported by Small Business: Owning the Future A San Francisco-based Malaysian chef is keeping busy during the pandemic with a diverse business model that has allowed her to improvise and generate revenue. None None None “Ten years ago  my business started off in a survivor mode ” Ms. Eusope said. “I was selling food under a tent at the farmers’ market. As a newly single mother  I needed income. I prepared the food  and at 4 o’clock in the morning  with my kids sleeping in the car  brought it to the farmers’ market and set up.” None None Independents  like Azalina’s  “will bear the brunt of the closures  both because of attributes that make most independents more vulnerable in this pandemic (minimal off-premise presence  limited digital capabilities  low emphasis on value-based menu items) and because of their unfavorable economics (thin margins and poor access to capital) ” according to the report. “Independents’ share of U.S. restaurant locations could fall from 53 percent in 2019 to 43 percent in 2021.” “It is devastating ” said Bonnie Riggs  a researcher and former restaurant industry analyst for The NPD Group’s food-service division. “In all my 40-plus years of reporting  we have never experienced anything like this  and no one knows what the impact will be on consumers and the consumer mind-set.” Ms. Eusope is a fifth-generation street vendor. She grew up on Penang Island off the coast of Malaysia and moved to San Francisco with her then-husband in 2001. “I was so far from my family  and I didn’t speak English very well ” she said. So she turned to her childhood mamak cuisine  a style from Muslim Indians  for solace. Her version of the style’s dishes includes laksa  a lemongrass curry noodle soup  hokkien mee  made with turmeric noodles and vegetables  a variety of curries served with coconut rice  and ayam masak merah  simmered chicken with green tomato chutney. After she was divorced  “I was thinking  how am I going to survive here in the United States with no savings and no financial stability ” she said. “I was a stay-at-home mom. I thought about the food I grew up watching my mother  my father and my grandmother make  and I kept making it for me and the kids. Those foods brought comfort and sometimes the sense of hope that it is going to be OK.” Ms. Eusope’s footprint has grown steadily from that food market tent to include a kiosk in the Market Square food hall  retail grocery sales and a catering business that she runs out of a 20 000-square-foot commissary kitchen  which includes a 7 000-square-foot hydroponic garden. Last year  she opened Mahila  a 2 100-square-foot full-service restaurant. She has 70 employees  the majority of whom are women. Construction is underway for three more restaurants. “Restaurateurs are survivors who build their businesses to be an anchor in their communities ” said Sean Kennedy  executive vice president of public affairs for the National Restaurant Association. “Throughout this national public health crisis  small and independent restaurants across the country have been creative and resourceful in pivoting their business models to keep their doors open.” Ms. Eusope’s biggest concern is her employees  whom she did not lay off. “Without my employees  I can’t be where I am today ” she said. “I need them. I can’t betray them. In the long run  they will be there for me.” Instead  she asked some of the managers to take small pay cuts to make it possible to keep everyone on the payroll. “I didn’t want my employees and their families to worry ” she said. “I come from a very poor family  and I know what money means.” A multipronged business model has allowed her to improvise and generate revenue. She shifted from the corporate event catering business that vanished in the pandemic to selling packaged sauces and noodle meal kits to local grocery stores and directly to consumers  which she had not done previously. And  like many restaurateurs  she increased curbside takeout orders via online ordering. As a result  her employees are preparing daily meals from ingredients grown in the hydroponic garden and food supplied by farmers whom Ms. Eusope has continued to buy from. She donates the meals that are not sold to community homeless shelters and food banks. Ms. Eusope chops and cooks alongside them. “I don’t want to get rusty and lose the momentum ” she said. “I come up with creative new dishes. For the restaurant  which is open five days a week  and the food hall location  we change our menu weekly and are selling an average of 150 meals a day.” She has also devoted down time for employee education and training. “We are cross-training our staff to know different aspects of our day-to-day production ” she said. “Hot-line cooks are learning pastry. Wait staff are now able to do minor prep. Our dishwashers are able to help our farmers with the hydroponic vegetables.” Ms. Eusope applied for several financial assistance grants  but none have come through. “I don’t want a loan that will keep putting me in the hole ” she said. “That’s stupid. I have to take care of myself. I can’t spend the rest of my life paying off my debt.” She also started a GoFundMe campaign. About $15 000 has been raised toward a goal of $25 000. Ms. Eusope has renegotiated her leases. “One landlord has been very kind and forgiven rent ” she said. “The other landlord wants at least 50 percent.” Nonetheless  the financial picture is troubling. She said the company had been healthy before and had a safety net  but she also took some money out of her personal savings. “We have lost a lot of money  and still continue losing money ” Ms. Eusope said. “At the beginning  it terrified me  but I have decided to surrender to the circumstances and continue running my business.” Ms. Eusope is persisting with the last stages of construction for the next locations and planning to open them by December. “It’s a big risk  but I am going for it ” she said. She expects Mahila  to reopen for dine-in customers on July 15. Seating will be only by reservation and at half occupancy. The menu will be limited and the prices lower. “This will help with inventory and less waste  and our takeout will be a simpler menu  as well ” she said. Ms. Eusope is nervous  but optimistic about her business. “I am not a big-name Michelin-star restaurant ” she said. “We have a good following of people. They have been buying food and supporting us. Some customers bring me flowers and tell me how much they love our food and are so grateful we are still doing this. That feeling of being appreciated is priceless. It makes me want to work even harder.” None None None None None Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/business/paycheck-protection-program-cross-river-bank.html,The Tiny Bank That Got Pandemic Aid to 100 000 Small Businesses Advertisement Supported by Cross River has cranked out more loans under the federal Paycheck Protection Program than all but three of the country’s biggest lenders. None From its address on the west side of the Hudson River to its tiny balance sheet  Cross River Bank is nothing like Manhattan’s Wall Street behemoths. But as part of the government’s efforts to stave off an economic catastrophe  it stands among giants. None Cross River’s size — it has a single branch  in Teaneck  N.J.  and just a few billion dollars in assets — means it’s generally described as a community bank. But it’s anything but a small-town lender: Cross River has spent the past decade carving out a lucrative business as a bank for the financial technology start-ups trying to compete with traditional banks. When the coronavirus pandemic ground businesses to a halt  the government wanted to use banks to distribute $660 billion in forgivable loans — fast — to small-business owners trying to pay workers who might otherwise become jobless. Cross River was one of the quickest and most aggressive  working with dozens of so-called fintechs to scoop up borrowers who couldn’t get the attention of the big banks. “This is in our DNA ” said Gilles Gade  Cross River’s founder and chief executive. “It’s exactly what we were built for.” In normal times  Cross River is a largely invisible partner for dozens of companies like Affirm  which offers on-the-spot financing for online purchases  and Upgrade and Upstart  which make personal loans. It’s accustomed to high-volume  low-dollar lending. But the Paycheck Protection Program was an opportunity on a whole new scale  with small businesses across the country applying for hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency aid. More than 30 firms funneled some or all of their borrowers through Cross River  including large companies like Intuit  the maker of the popular QuickBooks accounting software  and Kabbage  an online small-business lender. Other borrowers arrived through niche businesses like Divvy  an expense management tool  and Womply  a small-business marketing system  that wanted to serve their customers. None “I got word that I was approved the next day ” Ms. Smith said. When the loan’s closing documents arrived  Cross River’s name was on them. Her cash arrived a week later. She reopened last week and plans to use her loan to pay her workers as business returns. None Those tiny loans add up. Cross River has lent a total of $4.7 billion — nearly twice the assets the bank had on its books less than three months ago  according to a regulatory filing. On its average loan  the bank collects a fee from the government of around $2 200  a portion of which is shared with the company that brought in the customer. Mr. Gade started Cross River  which has its headquarters in Fort Lee  N.J.  in 2008 after more than a decade of working on Wall Street. That included a stint as the chief financial officer of First Meridian Mortgage  which operated for a few years as Trump Mortgage after licensing the name of the future president. (Mr. Gade left soon after the name change  and said he had no ties to President Trump or his administration.) None This business model is known in the financial industry as “rent-a-charter” — the banks handle the industry’s strict regulatory demands  while the fintechs furnish the shiny interfaces. But the arrangement has downsides. Critics warn that it can enable predatory lending as fintechs dodge and weave around state usury caps and other consumer protection laws. None “Cross River has a pretty good appetite for risk ” said Ron Shevlin  the director of research for Cornerstone Advisors  a bank consultancy. The benefits of its fintech alliances have  so far  outweighed the financial and regulatory costs of the handful of deals that turned bad  he said. Mr. Gade sees the fintechs that use Cross River as fulfilling customer needs that traditional lenders have ignored. And to him  the Paycheck Protection Program was the ultimate unmet need. None Through its partners and its own website  where it accepted any qualified applicant  Cross River started cranking out thousands of loans. Gusto  which processes payrolls for around 100 000 small businesses  was one of those partners. It took less than 24 hours to connect Gusto’s systems to Cross River’s and sign a contract  said Megan Niedermeyer  Gusto’s head of legal and compliance. “Being able to do that in the middle of a crisis was impressive ” she said. Processing a high volume of loans was only part of the challenge. Cross River also needed cash. Loans made through the Paycheck Protection Program are nearly risk free for banks — they’re guaranteed against default and intended to be forgiven if borrowers comply with the program’s rules — but lenders have to advance the cash and wait months for the government to repay them. The Federal Reserve promised to set up a way for banks to have access to cash to lend  but details weren’t final by the time the program began. So if Cross River wanted to lend billions of dollars  it needed to find money to do it. The bank bought online ads in early April promoting high-yield 12- and 24-month certificates of deposit  with rates as high as 2.25 percent — about twice the industry average at the time. That brought in $250 million. Cross River also paid high rates to attract about $1 billion in long-term deposits from fintechs like Betterment and Wealthfront  giving it access to immediate cash. “We raised a ton of deposits and built a war chest ” Mr. Gade said. “It was very costly.” The Fed opened its lending program in mid-April  giving Cross River a much cheaper way to obtain cash for loans. The bank soon became its biggest borrower. None But the bank’s job isn’t finished — with just 350 employees  it still has to service all of the 106 000 loans it has made. Borrowers who want their debt forgiven must prove they used the money appropriately  a potentially complicated process. None Scratch is even smaller than Cross River — fewer than 50 employees — but Mr. Gade is cautiously optimistic that things will go smoothly  even if he has learned to count on nothing with the relief program. At every step  it has been chaotic  plagued by technical problems  shifting rules and confusion. But the challenge has been worth it  Mr. Gade said. “Every loan we send out  we’re saving businesses ” he said. “We’re saving paychecks — we’re saving lives. That’s really the way we look at it.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/us/politics/treasury-small-business-ppp-loan-disclosure.html,Treasury Dept. Agrees to Release Data on Small-Business Relief Advertisement Supported by The decision to reveal who received a Paycheck Protection Program loan comes after weeks of backlash over a lack of transparency. None None None The new disclosures will apply to loans of more than $150 000. The information will be broken down into five loan ranges  topping out at the maximum amount of $10 million. The Small Business Administration will release business names  addresses  demographic data and jobs supported. The Treasury Department  which jointly administers the loan program with the S.B.A.  did not say when the new information would be made public  however  some of the demographic data will be included in loan forgiveness applications  which might not be submitted for months. Treasury officials said on Friday that the decision  which has bipartisan support  would provide transparency while maintaining protection for small businesses. It does not appear that any additional legislation will be required  and the Treasury maintains that the law did not mandate the disclosure of additional data. Thus far  the administration has been providing only information about loan approval totals and lenders  along with basic geographic and industry information. No data specific to companies has been released. “I am pleased that we have been able to reach a bipartisan agreement on disclosure which will strike the appropriate balance of providing public transparency  while protecting the payroll and personal income information of small businesses  sole proprietors  and independent contractors ” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. Jovita Carranza  the S.B.A. administrator  noted that the disclosures would still protect personally identifiable information of entrepreneurs  such as a home addresses associated with the business loans. The Treasury Department said that the detailed disclosures would apply to about 75 percent the loans that have been approved. Information about loans that are worth less than $150 000 will be released in aggregate by ZIP code  industry  business type and demographics. Many of the businesses that took smaller loans are sole proprietors and Treasury officials did not want information such as home addresses or other personal details for those business owners to be published. None None “The administration should release the names of all P.P.P. borrowers — as the S.B.A. routinely does for similar loan programs ” the lawmakers wrote in a letter to the heads of the Treasury Department and the S.B.A. Mr. Mnuchin signaled on Monday that he was prepared to change course and he engaged in discussions with Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida and the chairman of the Senate’s small-business committee  to find a compromise solution. On Friday  Mr. Rubio applauded the decision to disclose more information. “The American people deserve to know how effective the P.P.P. was in protecting our nation’s small businesses and the tens of millions of Americans they employ ” he said in a statement. “I also understand the very real concern that many small-business owners have with regard to disclosing proprietary information.” Private businesses have been fearful that if data is released about the loans  their confidential information will be made public and they could be vulnerable to hostile takeovers. They have also been concerned that their employees could be more susceptible to poaching if competitors learn what they are paying their workers. None That has dampened enthusiasm for revealing participation in the government program. Disclosure of loans “could hurt business owners from a credit standpoint  from a competition standpoint and even from a P.R. standpoint ” Kevin Kuhlman  senior director of government relations at the National Federation of Independent Business  said in an interview this week. Mr. Kuhlman said businesses were fearful that taking P.P.P. loans was becoming a “public shaming exercise” that would be exacerbated if borrower information was released. The White House and Congress have been discussing whether to renew the lending program  which has gone through several changes after it was created as part of the $2.2 trillion economic stabilization package. Complaints about the lack of transparency surrounding the program threatened to become an obstacle in an upcoming round of stimulus legislation. According to the latest figures  4.5 million loans totaling $512 billion have been approved. Advertisement ,articles/business

None None None None None None Lobbyists and lawmakers say the Trump administration  which has lost several economic advisers in recent weeks  is not deeply engaged in devising another rescue package. Officials have hinted for weeks that they would formally propose tax cuts  infrastructure spending and other initiatives  but they have not followed through. President Trump has asserted that the economy is rebounding but has expressed support for additional tax cuts and government spending. “Today’s announcement proves our economy is coming roaring back ” he said on Thursday after the jobs report. “It’s coming back extremely strong.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  appearing with Mr. Trump  said: “Our work is not done. Our work won’t be done until every single American that lost their job due to Covid is back to work.” None “I don’t understand how a senator can go home and not have delivered supercharged unemployment along the lines we’re talking about ” said Senator Ron Wyden  Democrat of Oregon  who introduced legislation on Wednesday that would allow expanded unemployment benefits to continue as long as the economy was weak. None Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  told reporters on Tuesday that the focus of any legislation taken up in the Senate would be “kids  jobs and health care ” as well as liability protections for hospitals  doctors  nurses  businesses  colleges and universities. Senator Roy Blunt  Republican of Missouri  said he had asked lawmakers and staff on the committee responsible for overseeing health  education and labor spending to begin compiling a package  while Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the minority leader  said he had been meeting with Mr. McConnell to prepare a legislative measure by the end of the month. “It’s just a matter of figuring out kind of what those levers and dials are on the various programs where we need to do more ” Senator John Thune of South Dakota  the No. 2 Republican in the Senate  told reporters. “We  Senate Republicans  are doing this assessment  determining where we think the greatest needs are going to be  watching what’s happening in the economy as it opens up.” A bipartisan group of lawmakers is also homing in on a deal to revamp the government’s efforts to help small businesses  likely including at least a partial shift from offering what were essentially grants to companies that kept workers on their payrolls to offering low- or no-interest  long-term loans. Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent  after it hit 14.7 percent in April  which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None None “As the shutdowns have grown longer  it has become clear that millions of small employers need additional help if they are to keep their heads above water and survive ” said Senator Susan Collins  Republican of Maine and one of the architects of the emerging plan to help businesses. “I believe that we are very close to reaching bipartisan agreement  and I know that for small businesses that are struggling  such an agreement cannot come soon enough.” None Industries that have been particularly hard hit  like entertainment venues  continue to push for more generous and targeted aid to keep them afloat  like tax credits for a portion of refunded tickets. “I think we need more now  more than ever to keep the momentum — I want to pour on the gas  right?” said Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina  who added that he still objected to maintaining the $600 unemployment benefit. “I want a package that will keep the economy moving forward  more people being employed.” Some conservatives continue to push congressional leaders and Mr. Trump to resist any additional government spending. Many economists disagree  saying further aid is needed to support the economy through what could be a long and slow recovery. Federal spending has been “very important” to preventing an even steeper economic nose-dive  said Aneta Markowska  chief economist at the investment bank Jefferies. But it is at risk of running out long before the economy is ready to stand on its own. “The stimulus was very short-lived ” she said. ‘This problem is going to persist long beyond July.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/business/economic-recovery-virus-surge.html,The ‘Rocket Ship’ Economic Recovery Is Crashing Advertisement Supported by Real-time data suggest a quick resurgence of business activity is leveling off nationally — and reversing in states like Arizona and Texas. None The nascent restart of America’s economy has begun to stall as a surge in new coronavirus cases dampens consumer and business activity across states like Florida  Texas and Arizona. After weeks of a pandemic-induced contraction  the economy had begun rebounding faster than many economists expected from mid-April into June  as infection rates stabilized or fell across much of the country and the federal government injected trillions of dollars in the economy. States began to reopen  shoppers increased their spending and employers started to hire back furloughed workers. None None Recent detailed data tell a more sobering story. New job postings on the employment platform ZipRecruiter fell in June after rising sharply in May. Data on small business openings and employment from Homebase  which provides scheduling and time tracking software for businesses  show that small business employment and openings worsened over the past week  after plateauing for much of June. The Homebase data showed a nearly 40 percent improvement for small business activity in May  across all of June  that fell to 6 percent. None None None None Child care constraints are keeping many workers  particularly Black and Hispanic women  from returning to work  according to weekly census survey data analyzed by Ernie Tedeschi  an economist at Evercore ISI.  Some economists say the slowdown was predictable — and a natural reaction to Americans attempting to rush back toward normalcy before the virus was under control. None Mr. Goolsbee  who is a professor at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business  and his colleague Chad Syverson used cellular phone records to track visits to businesses during the pandemic.  The research found that just over one-tenth of the drop was attributable to lockdowns themselves  a share that held constant as areas began to lift restrictions in May. The authors say that suggests that if infections accelerate  public officials will not be able to avoid another economic shock simply by refusing to shut down activity. Consumers will make that decision for them. When cases of the virus first began rising earlier this year  many economists hoped that  with the right set of policies  the United States could avoid most long-term economic damage. The idea was that by providing trillions of dollars in support for households and businesses  the federal government could  in effect  keep the economy in stasis until the health crisis had passed. None But that still leaves close to half of all those who have lost jobs still out of work  with no immediate prospects for a return. That group is disproportionately Black and Hispanic  and concentrated in low-wage service industries  the survey found. Perhaps unsurprisingly  those respondents are far less sanguine about the direction of the economy than Americans overall. Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent  after it hit 14.7 percent in April  which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None “How can we have a recovery when millions of people are now permanently unemployed?” asked John Singh  a survey respondent in Los Angeles. “How can we have an economy when big companies have just thrown in the towel?” Mr. Singh’s husband was furloughed from his job at a large corporation  but returned to work — from home — this week. The break was a loss of income  but not a major career disruption. It is a different story for Mr. Singh. He runs a small public relations agency — he is the only full-time employee — and his main client is in film distribution. When theaters shut down in mid-March  his revenue dried up overnight. With theaters expected to be among the last industries to return to normal  he doesn’t expect his business to bounce back anytime soon. The Homebase data suggest a yawning divide in the experiences of businesses that never closed for the pandemic and those that shut down as it began to spread. Employee hours and total number of employees are running just above pre-crisis levels at retailers that never closed. But many businesses have not reopened  which Homebase officials said in a report this week could be a sign that as many as 20 percent of all small businesses will permanently close amid the crisis. “For many of our business owners  it doesn’t yet make sense to open at the level of customer demand they’re seeing ” said Ray Sandza  vice president of data and analytics at Homebase.  Data from Kronos  which provides time-management software and related services  tells a similar story. The number of shifts worked by the company’s roughly 30 000 U.S. customers have rebounded strongly since mid-April but remain down 15 percent compared to before the crisis. Now the pace of growth has slowed in Georgia and some other early-reopening states  and the number of shifts worked has fallen outright in South Carolina and Florida since the beginning of June. “We bounced off the bottom  and it was a sharp bounce off the bottom ” said Dave Gilbertson  vice president of strategy and operations at Kronos. “Now is going to be what really proves out the full pace of the recovery  and it’s going to take longer.” Several factors could complicate that next phase. For one  many day care centers remain closed or limited  restricting some parents’ ability to return to work. “I don’t see how parents get back to work in a meaningful way if their kids can’t be in day care or back in school ” said Melissa S. Kearney  a University of Maryland economist who directs the Aspen Institute’s Economic Strategy Group. “Figuring out how to make that happen needs to be at the top of the list.” Ms. Kearney warned in a report with several co-authors in June that the recovery could stall if Congress fails to maintain the support for people and businesses that has helped buoy consumer spending. Senators are poised to leave Washington this week  returning in mid-July  with negotiations on a new economic aid bill still in their early stages. Nathaniel Popper contributed reporting.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/business/paycheck-protection-program-coronavirus.html,$130 Billion Left at Paycheck Program Deadline  but Senate Acts to Extend It Advertisement Supported by Forgivable loans went to nearly five million small businesses that could use the money to pay workers to stay home. Shifting rules blunted the effect. None None None None John Lettieri  the chief executive of the Economic Innovation Group  a think tank focused on entrepreneurship  praised the program  calling the aid it provided to small businesses “a major achievement.” But there was still work to be done  he said. None None The cash went to a wide variety of companies: manufacturing firms with hundreds of workers  Main Street retailers with a few dozen employees  and freelancers working for themselves. The loans ranged from a few hundred dollars to $10 million  and allowed businesses to keep paying employees — even if they had nothing to do but sit at home. None None The loan he received through the program on April 16 gave him a financial safety net as he began to reopen — with a host of new health precautions — in early May. Sales are back to around 90 percent of normal  and Dr. Stansbury said he was cautiously optimistic that the worst had passed for his business. Nearly all of his workers are back on the job. “If we hadn’t had this money to get us through  things would have been pretty dire ” he said. “I don’t think we would have been able to reopen all of our locations right away.” None None Before the Senate vote late Tuesday  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told members of the House Financial Services Committee that he had been in discussions with senators from both parties about allowing the remaining funds to be repurposed. A few hours later  the Senate approved legislation that would extend the program to Aug. 8. Lenders cited two main reasons there was money left over. First  most eligible companies that wanted a loan were ultimately able to obtain one. (The program limited each applicant to only one loan.) Also  the program’s complicated and shifting requirements dissuaded some qualified borrowers  who feared they would be unable to get their loan forgiven. Trying to comply with those rules was a challenge for many businesses. None Ms. Singleton said she might have chosen to spend the money more slowly if things had been different. “But I had to go with the rules as they were at the time ” she said. When she received the loan  businesses had just eight weeks to spend the cash if they wanted to have the loan completely forgiven. So Ms. Singleton  who had switched to curbside pickup sales  brought back dozens of workers  brainstorming new projects for them to tackle. Her payroll ballooned from a skeleton crew of eight to a peak of 48 employees. But as the clock ticked down to the end of her eight weeks of support  it became clearer to lawmakers that the downturn wasn’t ending anytime soon. None “We looked at this as a bridge ” she said. “Then our time was up  and there’s no solid ground to stand on yet.” None None Some of those employers  like Ms. Singleton  are weighing their bottom lines against the continued uncertainty of the pandemic. Even though Minnesota has allowed restaurants to reopen for outdoor dining and limited indoor seating  Ms. Singleton has stuck with curbside pickup. She is watching with dread as infection rates soar in areas that relaxed their restrictions and is wary of putting her employees or customers at risk. “I frankly don’t think it’s safe ” she said. “You can really only reopen once. If we had to open and shut down again  that would be a nightmare.” Emily Cochrane contributed reporting. Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/business/small-business-reopening-coronavirus.html,What It Takes to Reopen a Small Business Right Now Advertisement Supported by Masks are just the start. Entrepreneurs around the U.S. are figuring out what to do as they go  and hoping that they can make it work. None Tiffany Turner had dinner recently in a restaurant — the first time in nearly three months. She was greeted by employees in cotton face masks and seated at a table that was a socially distanced six feet from any other. Her return-to-society meal? Caesar salad  mussels and clam chowder. “The thing I was surprised by as a guest is that it was less awkward than I expected and more human energy than I expected ” Ms. Turner said. “People’s eyes are starting to tell a story more than they ever did.” It was a reassuring experience. Ms. Turner was preparing to reopen Adrift Hospitality  her group of five boutique hotels  a restaurant and a distillery on the Oregon and Washington coasts. She wondered if people would return to public life and if there would be any sense of human connection. That’s the same question other small-business owners are asking themselves as more states allow restaurants  offices and retail businesses to reopen after being closed  some for as long as three months  to fight the spread of the coronavirus. The percentage of small businesses that were open in early June was nearly 16 points higher than it was in mid-April  according to Opportunity Insights  an economic tracker developed by researchers at Harvard using anonymized data from credit card processors  payroll firms and others. None Some businesses are taking a slow approach. At first  Chris Lynch and Michael Samer weren’t sure what to do about their ocean adventure tours business  Everyday California  when they got the go-ahead in late April. “In the beginning  it was scary ” Mr. Samer said. “We wondered  ‘Do we even want to reopen?’” But the two friends  who started the company in San Diego 10 years ago with just an iPad  an old truck and some kayaks  didn’t want to give up. They had been on a pace for a banner 2020: Sales were up 50 percent in the first two months  and March was looking just as good. And they realized the water might be one of the most socially distant places someone could be. Mr. Lynch and Mr. Samer decided to reopen with curbside kayak and surf rentals only  keeping their retail shop and tour business closed. Then  as they felt more comfortable  they reintroduced tours at a 50 percent capacity with everyone wearing a mask. They also invested in their neglected online shop. The bet paid off: They increased what had been a very small number of online merchandise sales by 710 percent in May  allowing them to bring back about 20 employees to help with shipping and marketing. So far  the best-selling items on the website have been hats. “It might be because no one can get a haircut ” Mr. Lynch joked. Everyday California’s tours and rentals are booked  and sales have rebounded to about 50 percent of normal levels. A slow rollout isn’t happening only in places  like California  that have been Covid-19 hot spots. In Montana  which has the fewest cases in the nation  some owners are also taking a wait-and-see approach. Gov. Steve Bullock allowed bars and restaurants to reopen in early May with 50 percent capacity limits and layout restrictions  but Brett Evje held out until the end of the month before bringing customers back into Plonk  the New American-style restaurant he co-owns. It has locations in Bozeman and Missoula. He used the downtime to refresh the Bozeman location  updating the HVAC system  installing new bar equipment and doing all of the projects he said could never complete with a restaurant open 365 days a year. “Everybody wants to return back to normal  but from my standpoint you’re already closed  so you might as well wait and see what the reaction is going to be ” Mr. Evje said. “There’s nothing as hard as remobilizing and bringing everyone back and then having to close down again.” Mr. Evje also wanted customers to have as normal an experience as possible  so he decided not to require masks for employees or patrons. Montana officials only recommend face coverings. “Our customers were really excited that we weren’t making the experience awkward ” he said. The cost of reopening is another challenge: With no revenue for months  small businesses must find ways to pay for the new sanitation regimens  thermometers  plexiglass  masks and other items necessary to open. “None of the relief packages have included specific funding for safety retrofitting  purchasing of safety equipment or even helping business getting a handle on uniform P.P.E. for employees and customers ” said Amanda Ballantyne  executive director of the Main Street Alliance  an advocacy group for small business. “The lack of those things creates a disparate recovery kind of landscape.” Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected.

But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None Staying open has been an expensive proposition for Hanover Co-op Food Stores. The company  which is owned by its 24 000 members  has been open throughout the pandemic as an essential business at four stores in Vermont and New Hampshire. That has cost nearly $400 000  said Allan Reetz  the company’s director of public and government affairs. The biggest expense? Staffing. The co-op gave all of its nearly 400 employees a flat bonus plus offered $2 an hour extra. It also went through with a planned cost-of-living increase in April. Other expenses included equipment  signage  communications and plexiglass dividers. “We said  first and foremost  we need make sure that the employees understand that we will do everything within our power for their health and safety ” Mr. Reetz said. “They are the ones who make the business run.” Ms. Turner at Adrift Hospitality said she was able to keep these costs to about $10 000  her employees could build most things on site. Her main expenses were reconfiguring Adrift Distillers into a hand-sanitizer manufacturer and paying additional workers to manage new sanitation regimens and check-in systems. Another cost: disposable masks for guests — who are using about 100 per day. “We’ve been kind of scrappy ” she said. Mr. Lynch at Everyday California said that he’s had also spent about $10 000 on physical changes to the shop and new processes  but that he was applying for a state grant to help offset those costs. Mr. Evje has had minimal expenses related to reopening  although he has had to hire more workers  too. With capacity limited and demand uncertain  small-business owners  even those whose operations are larger  say it’s hard to know whether to spend the money to reopen now or to wait. Elliot Nelson  who owns McNellie’s Group  with 20 restaurants in Arkansas and Oklahoma  is sifting through his spreadsheets daily to see what it’s going to take to keep going. “It’s been a long time since I’ve gone through the financials like this ” he said. Mr. Nelson started bringing his empire back online gradually in May  beginning with outdoor dining. But six weeks later  business is still slow  sales are about one-third their normal level. His sushi restaurants are doing well  but the breakfast joints are suffering. “Our best-case scenario  maybe we’re 60 to 70 percent revenue by the end of the year ” Mr. Nelson said. “And that’s just a break even — and only that if I’m not paying my debt service.” He’s reconsidering every cost: rent deals with landlords  reduced menus  trash collection  monthly computer expenses. He and his wife even met with a lawyer to see if they should get a divorce as a wealth-preservation tactic. “These are the mind-boggling conversations we’re having ” Mr. Nelson said. “We need a stabilization fund or a super-enhanced Paycheck Protection Program  or it’s bankruptcy.” None None None None None Advertisement ,articles/business

Comes Roaring Back in the Pandemic Advertisement Supported by Now that the stock market has largely shrugged off the coronavirus  start-ups are scrambling to go public. None None But with many dealerships closed under shelter-in-place orders  people started buying more cars online  benefiting Vroom with record sales in March and April  the company said. “We saw the whole world stabilizing ” said Paul Hennessy  the chief executive. “At the end of April  we said  ‘OK  maybe we should actually go on the offensive here.’” Vroom  which is based in New York  capped that offensive by going public last week. Its share price more than doubled on the first day of trading as the company raised $495 million from its offering. None None None Some of the biggest Silicon Valley start-ups are taking steps toward an I.P.O.  too. Airbnb  the home rental start-up valued at $31 billion  said it hadn’t ruled out going public this year. Palantir  a digital surveillance company valued at $20 billion  is preparing to file for an I.P.O. in the coming weeks  said a person briefed on the start-up’s plans  who declined to be named because the talks were private. None “The window is open ” said Previn Waas  a partner focused on I.P.O.s at the professional services firm Deloitte. “Everyone has figured out that a virtual I.P.O. is possible. There’s an appetite for companies to go public.” Jeff Thomas  head of West Coast listings and capital markets at the Nasdaq stock exchange  said  “Everybody who was in process is gearing back up.” Morgan Stanley had spent the last few months helping companies affected by the coronavirus find financing in every form — except public offerings  said Colin Stewart  Morgan Stanley’s head of technology equity capital markets. The market was too volatile  and companies had to assess how the virus had changed their financial forecasts  he said. But now with the stock market more stable  the situation has changed. “It’s clear there is a lot of pent-up investor demand to look at I.P.O.s ” Mr. Stewart said. None None But excitement for new listings — especially for fast-growing tech companies — has sidelined the question of profitability. Investors have become more tolerant of money-losing companies because the virus has accelerated the adoption of technology like e-commerce  virtual learning  streaming  telehealth and delivery  said Gavin Baker  chief investment officer at Atreides Management  which invests in private and public companies. “Covid pulled the world into 2030 ” Mr. Baker said. Not all of the companies that were on track to go public this year may make it  given how the economy is reeling from the pandemic. In early March  EquityZen  an investment service that tracks I.P.O.s  published a list of nine potential candidates for the year. Four — including the home rental company Vacasa  the 3-D printing company Desktop Metal and Velodyne Lidar  which makes technology for driverless cars — have since laid off staff because of the coronavirus. “If we wrote the list today  it would have a very different set of components ” said Phil Haslett  a co-founder of EquityZen.

But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None The window for I.P.O.s right now may be small. A second wave of virus-related shutdowns could send the stock market into another tailspin. Companies also need to navigate disclosing their second-quarter financials  as well as holidays like Labor Day and Yom Kippur. Plus there is the November presidential election  which may create volatility in the market. As a result  more companies than usual are aiming to go public in August  a month they traditionally avoided because people were often on vacation  Mr. Thomas of Nasdaq said. The exchange is telling companies to be ready to go public any time  he said  and to have alternative financing ready in case they can’t. For chief executives trying to take their companies public now  the timing is a nail-biter. Henry Schuck  founder and chief executive of ZoomInfo  had been planning to get his company out to the stock market in late March. But when the virus hit  he started checking the VIX  an index that measures stock market volatility  every day. The index had rarely topped 20 over the past decade  but in March  it topped 80. “The market was just not in a place to have an I.P.O. come out ” he said. In May  after the market had stabilized  Mr. Schuck decided to go for it. But there were other challenges. While executives typically go on a “roadshow” to pitch their company’s shares to investors  he was stuck at home. So he crammed back-to-back virtual meetings with investors into a week. Even though he was at home  he said  he made sure to dress up and even wear shoes. On the morning of ZoomInfo’s I.P.O. on June 4  Mr. Schuck hit a ceremonial virtual button to open trading  alongside his wife and 4-year-old daughter. ZoomInfo’s shares rose more than 60 percent on the first day of trading. Mr. Hennessy of Vroom also held a virtual roadshow  taking meetings with investors via teleconference from his home in Suffern  N.Y. He said he appreciated the efficiency of the roadshow  which would normally have lasted two weeks across multiple cities. On the day of the I.P.O. on June 9  Mr. Hennessy and his executive team could not travel to Nasdaq  where Vroom was listing  to press the opening buzzer since the exchange was not open to visitors. Nasdaq provided Vroom’s employees with an app to upload photos of themselves  which the exchange displayed on its tower in New York’s Times Square. Vroom’s office  nearby at 37th Street and Broadway  remained closed  but a few employees in masks went to see their faces displayed on the tower  Mr. Hennessy said. He said he had preferred it to an in-person ceremony  since people in the whole company got to participate by sending in photos and sharing screenshots of themselves on the tower. “Those Nasdaq moments are over in a few minutes with some confetti ” he said. “This lasted a couple of hours.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/business/recession-stock-market-coronavirus.html,Despite Recession  Stock Markets Turn Positive for the Year Advertisement Supported by The S&P 500 climbed back above where it began the year on the same day that economists said the United States fell into a recession in February. None And just like that  we’re back to where we started. The S&P 500  a leading stock market index  on Monday climbed back above where it began the year — before the pandemic brought the United States economy to a juddering halt  before more than 110 000 Americans died from the coronavirus  and before the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis set off nationwide protests. None Even though the economy has begun to reopen  it is hard to overstate how disastrous the past three months have been and what the long-term consequences are for everything  from the nature of work to the future of certain industries. Tens of millions of people are unemployed  corporate earnings have plummeted  and industries such as tourism  retail and entertainment might never fully recover from the blow dealt to their businesses. But in the stock market  it’s like the pandemic never happened. “Investors seem to have decided that the past three months were just a bad dream that we’re waking up from ” said Scott Clemons  chief investment strategist for private banking at Brown Brothers Harriman  an investment bank. None So  why is the market behaving this way? None “It’s the only way that you can kind of explain what’s going on  is that people really do believe that there is no downside in equity ownership ” said James Montier  a member of the asset allocation team at Grantham  Mayo  Van Otterloo & Company  a Boston-based asset management company. Since March 23  the Dow Jones industrial average has soared 48 percent. The Nasdaq composite index  which is heavily weighted toward technology  is up 45 percent and closed at a record high on Monday  as investors bet that tech behemoths like Amazon and Microsoft were well positioned to benefit from stay-at-home orders around the country. The S&P 500 is also up nearly 45 percent. None Mr. Cooperman was referring to the flood of money — from both the Fed and the government itself — that has been pumped into the economy and markets. Since the Fed first took steps to stabilize the markets in March  it has created roughly $2.9 trillion  the vast majority of which has gone into financial markets. Separately  the federal government has said it would borrow a record-breaking $3 trillion from April to June  much of which will be channeled to businesses and consumers to keep them afloat during the shutdown. The biggest winners in the stock market rally have been companies whose very existence earlier appeared imperiled by the crisis  with investors now swooping in to buy the most battered shares in hopes of generating the biggest gains. As oil prices stabilized since the worst of the sell-off this year  the stock price of the Apache Corporation  an oil driller  quadrupled. Stock in the oil field services giant Halliburton has tripled. (Both still remain down for the year.) The cruise operators Norwegian and Royal Caribbean are both up more than 150 percent. The S&P’s energy sector stocks have risen more than 90 percent  while consumer discretionary stocks and financials are both up roughly 50 percent. Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent  after it hit 14.7 percent in April  which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None None “Right now the market thinks we’ll have a V-shaped recovery and a vaccine by the end of the year and I think both of those views are too optimistic ” said Byron Wien  a longtime market observer and the vice chairman of the private wealth group at Blackstone. While Mr. Wien believes the economy is recovering  he thinks it will be a slow return to normal. Wall Street analysts don’t expect that corporate profits for S&P 500 companies will return to 2019 levels until 2021. But the market rally has effectively already priced in all those gains  in part  some say  because of the government actions. Even after accounting for the government’s support  there are significant risks facing investors that could stop S&P 500 companies from generating the profits they did before the virus reached American shores. In recent years  large companies have bought back hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of stock through share repurchase programs. Such programs helped prop up stock prices. But as companies become more cautious  analysts expect them to instead conserve their cash  removing a key support for share prices. Economic and political tensions between the United States and China — the world’s two largest economies — also remain high  after the two superpowers engaged in a disruptive on-again-off-again trade war over the last two years. A renewed flurry of tariffs could further complicate the recovery for large American corporations as well as the global economy. Such tensions may also be more likely to re-emerge ahead of what could be a contentious presidential election in November. Then  there is the prospect of a second wave of the pandemic  which could set back the economy once more. But despite these potential challenges  market investors appear almost wholly unconcerned. “I think the market is best described as the way people think about second marriages ” said Mr. Wien  87 years old  who has been watching stocks on Wall Street since 1965. “It’s a triumph of hope over experience.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/business/why-the-stock-market-just-doesnt-care.html,Why the Stock Market Just Doesn’t Care Advertisement Supported by Strategies Civil unrest  racial inequality  pandemic  recession  severe unemployment? No problem. None None None You may want to place these items in a different order  add some or subtract others. But it would seem that at least we can all agree that we are looking at an ugly picture. Yet there is a glaring exception to all this gloom: the stock market. It has been absolutely fabulous! In fact  by some measures  the American market has never been better. Consider these remarkable statistics from Bespoke Investment Group. Through June 3 — the 50 trading days since the market’s coronavirus low on March 23 — the S&P 500 gained 39.3 percent. That was the best 50-day performance since comparable records began in 1952.  None None For many market veterans  this jarring juxtaposition — the nightmare on the streets and the dreamlike returns in the market — is regrettable but not shocking at all. None None “If you want to find morality  don’t look at the stock market ” said Richard Bernstein  who runs his own investment firm in Manhattan. The market is focused  as always  on one paramount concern: profit. That may well be repulsive in a moment of intense and widespread human suffering  but it is consistent. None But right now  it’s all about the money. And the immediate questions facing traders are whether current prices are insupportably high and  regardless of your answer to that question  whether they are soon likely to go higher still. None None None The consensus forecast for the current quarter calls for a decline of more than 30 percent in gross domestic product  according to Bloomberg  followed by a gain of 15 percent in the third quarter. If that sequence is close to correct  the economy will be in miserable shape in the fall  but the recession will be over. None Well  for one thing  the facts are not all positive. At the moment  tens of millions of Americans are still out of work and the unemployment rate in May was 13.3 percent  higher than in any previous postwar recession  even if better than the 14.7 percent rate of April. Another reason for skepticism is that stock prices are already quite steep  based on standard metrics like price-to-earnings ratios. That’s not terribly surprising  Mr. Paulsen said  because earnings typically fall sharply in a recession. Today’s prices — and higher ones in the weeks ahead — can be justified by the rock-bottom interest rates in place and by the prospect of increased corporate earnings in the future. “If the economy really rebounds ” he said  “then stock prices are likely to go higher.” But that is a big “if.” None Mr. Bernstein said the market is “priced for perfection” right now. If there are further waves of infections  or severe secondary or economic damage from the current slowdown  or a widening trade war  or any number of other problems  he said  ”we’ll see a major decline in prices.” He doesn’t know how to assess these risks. “That’s why we’re prudently wishy-washy ” he said. David Rosenberg  who runs a market research firm in Toronto  argues emphatically that whatever the short-term movements of the market  major declines and an extended economic struggle will be coming. He compared the current rally to the rebound that began in November 1929 and lasted until April 1930. The market gained almost 50 percent in that period  he said  but no one remembers it. What we remember is the Great Depression. But who wants to hear that? Not the stock market. It is ignoring a great deal and anticipating a better future. Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/business/luckin-coffee-china-fraud-wall-street.html,Chinese Coffee Chain’s Scandal Renews U.S. Calls for Oversight Advertisement Supported by The implosion of a Chinese competitor to Starbucks has bolstered the cause of American politicians aiming to stop opaque Chinese companies from raising money in the U.S. None None None None “The Luckin Coffee scandal is just one of many examples of Chinese fraud  and it should be a major wake-up call for policymakers and regulators that the time for action is now ” said Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida. China’s most powerful regulator has announced an investigation  and it made an unusual public statement to say it would work with Washington. Former regulatory officials and lawyers have expressed skepticism that China’s investigation of Luckin Coffee is anything more than perfunctory. The country’s moves have failed to ease American lawmakers’ broader concerns and have added to the risk of further clashes over financial relations. “If Chinese companies want access to the U.S. capital markets  they must comply with American laws and regulations for financial transparency and accountability ” said Mr. Rubio  who is pushing a bipartisan bill that would force Chinese companies to abide by federal auditing rules and disclosure requirements. None None Congressional aides said that federal regulators had tried to grapple with Chinese companies’ lack of transparency  with little success. A law could help  they said. Mr. Trump’s trade war with China has already set in motion some efforts to decouple the world’s two biggest economies. Some supply chains are shifting out of China. Access to critical technology is being limited. And American lawmakers from both parties have discussed other legislation that would make it harder for Americans and their pension funds to invest in Chinese companies. “There is no question that the lack of transparency and opacity by many Chinese companies  including as it relates to ownership structure and company ties to the Chinese Communist Party  create real and material risk for U.S. investors and for our capital markets ” said Senator Robert Menendez  Democrat of New Jersey  a co-sponsor of the bill with Mr. Rubio. The Luckin scandal has given American lawmakers a prominent example as they make their case. When it asked stock investors in America to back it last year  Luckin was an unprofitable start-up that handed out cash and aggressive subsidies to its customers. It promised to overtake Starbucks with its smartphone app for coffee delivery  thousands of stores and nearly 17 million customers  which it attracted by aggressively doling out coupons for Luckin drink products. Investors were so enthusiastic that they sent its shares jumping 20 percent on its first day of trading on the Nasdaq and the company raised some $645 million. Big names like BlackRock  the world’s largest asset manager  and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund quietly invested large sums. Venture capitalists sang its praises. Even when some market watchers began to warn that Luckin’s rosy outlook and revenue growth did not seem right  the stock kept soaring. In January  Luckin executives raised over a billion dollars through a secondary share issue and stock-like bonds. By then the market was valuing the company at $12 billion Around the same time  an investor  Carson Block  published an investigative report by an anonymous author that accused Luckin of fraud. A number of skeptical investors like him took positions to bet against its stock. Then  in April  those predictions came to bear. The company said an internal investigation had discovered that a top executive and other employees had fabricated some $310 million worth of transactions over 2019. In a day  some $5 billion was shaved off the company’s market value. Louis Dreyfus  one of the world’s biggest commodities traders  and other powerful investors lost millions. None A spokesman for Luckin declined to comment. The test now will be whether the S.E.C. can conduct its own investigation  with access to corporate documents and executives. The China Securities Regulatory Commission  the market regulator  has pledged to investigate. Over the weekend officials from the State Administration for Market Regulation raided the offices of Luckin executives. The commission in China this week did what many in the international regulatory community thought unthinkable: It said publicly that it would cooperate with the S.E.C. None American regulators  though  warn of the opposite. Last week  Jay Clayton  the chairman of the S.E.C.  said his agency was effectively powerless to investigate corporate skulduggery because of China’s lack of assistance. In 2018  the S.E.C. and the oversight board complained that they faced “significant challenges” in overseeing the financial reports for U.S.-listed companies based in China. Judith Burns  a spokeswoman for the S.E.C.  declined to comment. The recent statement from the Chinese commission is being read in different ways. Eric J. Pan  managing director of Rock Creek Global Advisors and former head of International Regulatory Policy at the S.E.C. said he interpreted it as “a pre-emptory defense against expected criticism ” of the Chinese regulator. “The C.S.R.C. basically is saying that it is doing everything properly  and it is the PCAOB that is acting unreasonably ” Mr. Pan said. To some  it was an indication that China may be worried about the impact of the scandal on its domestic stock market and the reputation of Chinese companies. “It will have an impact on Chinese companies who do things properly when they try to raise capital in U.S. stocks ” said Zhang Yifan  a private equity investor at Commando Capital  an investment fund in China. “It will indeed lead to a very serious crisis of trust. It will take years to ease ” Mr. Zhang said. None That could give an opening for lawmakers from both parties to move forward with the bills aimed at forcing Chinese companies to be more transparent or risk being delisted.  None A significant number had denied access to information sought by the accounting oversight board  the commission found. None “It’s in the tool kit of the means of punishing China ” he said. “But you can’t just to do it out of the blue. It’s not a finely calibrated strategy.” Cao Li contributed reporting from Hong Kong. Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/national-cathedral-masks-donation-coronavirus.html,National Cathedral  Nasdaq  Businesses and Unions Locate Troves of N95 Masks Advertisement Supported by One stockpile was in the cathedral’s crypt. Others were with companies like Goldman Sachs. And a health care union said it found 39 million more. None Joe Alonso  the head stonemason at the Washington National Cathedral  had tended to the building for 35 years. He knew its nooks and crannies. None “Over the last month  you start hearing  ‘N95 masks  N95 masks ’” he said. “I was like  ‘Oh yeah  all those N95 masks in the burial vault.’” None None For some multinational companies  the masks were part of a preparedness strategy for a variety of disasters. None None None None While some companies were donating what is in their reserves  Pornhub purchased and donated 50 000 surgical masks to New York-area medical professionals and emergency responders  a spokesman for the company said on Thursday. The company did not say where it obtained the masks. Lawrence O. Gostin  a professor of global health law at Georgetown University  said that it was good that these companies and institutions had a philanthropic instinct to donate masks  but that quality checks and quality assurance were needed. “What these companies should be doing is offering funding for the makings of new masks that have specified quality ” Mr. Gostin said. “One has to ponder how it is that private companies that just have marginal needs for masks at best have huge stockpiles that they can donate  and that the government doesn’t have enough in its strategic reserve.” At the cathedral  the 2 000 masks not donated were being kept as a “reserve supply for pastoral needs as they rise ” said Kevin Eckstrom  a spokesman for the cathedral  but the cathedral will re-evaluate the needs in the coming days. He said the “first priority was to get the majority of them out to the folks who need them most immediately.” The cache of masks was stored in 30 cases in an unfinished section of a burial vault that was built in the 1920s  Mr. Alonso said. In another section  the crypt contains the remains of people interred in the cathedral and several chapels. The boxes with the masks were pushed back into concrete niches  which had openings that were 3 feet by 3 feet  originally meant to hold coffins  Mr. Alonso said. The niches have been used mostly for storage  he said. “It’s really in the bowels of the cathedral  you could almost say ” he said. The masks had expired  Mr. Eckstrom said  but were determined to be safe to use after consulting with the mask manufacturer and following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “It’s a burial vault ” Mr. Alonso said. “It’s dry as a bone  as they say  down there. And kind of climate controlled. Very steady  low-humidity environment down in the crypt there.” He said that discovering and retrieving the masks was not like the experience some people had imagined: Cathedral workers did not crawl  like Indiana Jones  through any skulls or bones in an ancient crypt. Then again  Mr. Alonso said  he and others did have to crawl about 12 feet deep into burial slots to get the masks — “deeper than a normal-length casket” — wearing masks of their own against the dust. He added: “We had a little human chain going. Over the last couple days  we got them out  sorted them out.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/business/corner-office-coronavirus.html,Logged On From the Laundry Room: How the C.E.O.s of Google  Pfizer and Slack Work From Home Advertisement Supported by corner office As chief executives hunker down during the pandemic  home offices have become corporate headquarters. None On Thursday morning  Chuck Robbins  the chief executive of Cisco  signed on to an companywide video conference from his home office in Silicon Valley. The connection was stable  but the quality was not great. “I tell you ” he said in an earlier interview  “this whole teleworking thing — as much as we sell it to our customers  I’m not sure I want to do it 100 percent of the time.” In addition to Mr. Robbins  the video conference featured several mental health professionals  who spent an hour answering questions from Cisco employees grappling with the stress of working from home during the coronavirus outbreak. “Nobody prepares for this ” he said. Cisco  which makes networking equipment  has seen demand for its Webex video conferencing system spike. In response  it has redeployed teams to focus on making sure big customers can conduct everyday chats and board meetings remotely. Still  it is a stretch. “None of this technology was designed to support the entire world working from home ” Mr. Robbins said. “The Webex teams haven’t slept in days.” As the coronavirus sweeps the globe  even chief executives — who normally flit from meetings to conferences in chauffeured SUVs and private jets — have been confined to spare rooms. From there  they are working to keep their business afloat as the stock market plummets  managing supply chains upended by travel restrictions and labor shortages  and trying to keep their employees healthy and sane. For this installment of Corner Office — our biweekly C.E.O. interview column — I talked to the leaders of several prominent companies about what the experience has been like. At an undisclosed location in Silicon Valley  Sundar Pichai  the chief executive of Alphabet  has a very nice home office. Soaring ceilings. Artfully decorated two-tone bookshelves. A seating area. A really big plant. It’s the kind of home office you would expect the wealthy chief executive of one of the world’s most powerful technology company’s to have. From there  Mr. Pichai is monitoring the myriad ways that Alphabet — which includes Google  YouTube and more — is responding to the coronavirus crisis. Paramount among his concerns  he said  is ensuring that disinformation is kept in check. “We’re making sure that most of the information is coming from expert organizations and journalistic organizations  and are trying to surface them higher across all our products ” he said via a Hangouts video call. At the same time  Google is seeing a spike in demand for its G-Suite and Hangouts products  and has most of its employees working from home as well. “It’s a miracle you can run a company this way ” he said. Mr. Pichai  like so many  is also having to navigate the home front. “The day-to-day juggling of all this stretches all of us ” he said. “It was not easy to help my teenage daughter to understand what is going on.” Adena Friedman  the chief executive of Nasdaq  made the decision weeks ago: Key personnel at the stock exchange would be split into two teams. Each week  one team would work from home and the other would work from the office. Over the weekend  the office would be cleaned. In the event that one team got sick  the other team could run the company. During her rotations away from the office  Ms. Friedman has been working from her primary residence in Chevy Chase  Md. — along with her husband and two sons  both in their 20s  all of whom are also working from home. Ms. Friedman follows the same routine each workday. She wakes up at 5:30 a.m.  rides on her Peloton  eats breakfast and gets to work. During the day  she is monitoring the steady decline in the markets  trying to ensure that banks — which also have most employees working remotely — are clearing trades  and taking meetings with executives who are also at home. “What’s been really fun is to peer into the personal lives of your colleagues ” she said in a telephone interview. “Sometimes a kid will walk into the room. My dog has been barking all day.” When Ms. Friedman gets hungry  she runs downstairs and makes herself a peanut butter and honey sandwich  then races back to her office for more calls. “It is a high stress environment right now ” she said. For Stewart Butterfield  the chief executive of Slack  it was bad time to have spotty internet service. He was stuck at home in San Francisco amid the shelter-in-place orders last week  and had an all-company video conference to host. But with his home internet wonky because of construction  there was just one room that had a decent connection. “I did the all-hands from the laundry room ” he said in a telephone interview. Slack  the messaging company  has experienced a sharp spike in usage in recent weeks  as much as 30 percent above previous highs of messages sent per day. “We’ve seen an incredible surge in new sign-ups that has tracked pretty closely to the countries that have been affected ” he said. Mr. Butterfield contends the new demand has galvanized the team. “It was probably the most productive week of work in the company’s history ” he said. But Mr. Butterfield said he was aware that it might not last. “The adrenaline rush eventually wears off ” he said. “We don’t want people to burn out.” Albert Bourla  the chief executive of drugmaker Pfizer  was happy when the bickering began. His college-aged daughter had moved back home to Scarsdale  N.Y.  after the coronavirus closed schools around the country  and she was already at it with her mother. “I had missed the fights between my wife and my daughter ” he said in a telephone interview. “I’m happy to see it once more. The day starts with a fight and ends with a fight.” When not delighting in his reunited family  Mr. Bourla is grappling with the immensity of the challenges confronting Pfizer  a global company that is also a critical cog in the health care system. “My mind right now is spinning a thousand times ” he said. “It’s not only that I feel responsible for the 90 000 people of Pfizer. I feel a responsibility to bring a solution to this crisis.” Pfizer is ramping up production of medicines that might be needed to treat patients suffering from Covid-19  the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. It has also begun aggressive research into a vaccine for the virus  as well as antiviral treatments. Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent  after it hit 14.7 percent in April  which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None Mr. Bourla saw the crisis coming somewhat earlier than others. Pfizer’s offices in Asia were affected by the coronavirus months ago  and Mr. Bourla said the novelty of remote working quickly wore thin for workers there. “After a couple of weeks there was a fatigue of working from home ” he said. “It feels very strange.” Gregg Renfrew  the chief executive of Beautycounter  was trying to work from an apartment in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles  but her husband kept interrupting her video calls. Beautycounter  a private company that makes makeup and shampoos  doesn’t sell through stores. Instead  it does most of its business through a network of consultants — mostly women — who sell to their friends and associates. Ms. Renfrew has been trying her best to manage the disruption wrought by the coronavirus — fortifying her supply chain  increasing the production of some essential items and postponing some product launches. But the pressure to keep the company running is intense at a time when many small business owners are facing an existential crisis. “I have 50 000 people whose livelihood depends on us ” she said in an interview via Zoom. “And I have to acknowledge that I don’t have all the answers.” Last week  in recognition that everyone was feeling a bit frazzled  Ms. Renfrew told company employees to take Friday off. “We all need to figure out how to manage everything ” she said. “Then we can come back and get to work.” On a conference call the other day  Marc Benioff  the Salesforce chief executive and co-founder  made an insensitive remark. Describing how the company was meeting customer demand during the coronavirus crisis  he said  “We have a full Chinese menu of options for our customers.” The blowback was swift  with employees around the country reprimanding him via email. Mr. Benioff apologized.  “I am learning new levels of sensitivity ” Mr. Benioff said via FaceTime from his home office in San Francisco  where he is holed up amid the region’s shelter-in-place order. Like most of his 50 000 employees  he is juggling professional demands and personal life from home. Mr. Benioff  already a rampant networker  said the volume of inbound communication he is receiving surpasses anything he has experienced before. “It’s everything from working with our management team to planning the fiscal year ” he said. “I’m having to adjust what my priorities are.” Also: His father-in-law is staying with him  and his mother comes over for dinner every night. To cope  Mr. Benioff  a Buddhist  has been meditating more. Salesforce employees are also feeling the strain. Mr. Benioff said an internal survey revealed that 36 percent of his work force was experiencing mental health challenges these days. “And those are the ones who are willing to admit it ” he said. “We’re starting a daily mental health call  to encourage daily prayer meditation and mindfulness.” Giovanni Caforio  the chief executive of the drugmaker Bristol Myers Squibb  was monitoring the coronavirus long before most Americans. Mr. Caforio is Italian  and his brother  who works in a hospital in Rome  told him weeks ago that the virus was serious. “I know firsthand three people in the I.C.U. ” Mr. Caforio said in a telephone interview. “Two in Milan and one in Rome.” Now Mr. Caforio is running the company from his home in Princeton  N.J.  where his wife and two children are also trying to keep up with their responsibilities. His wife manages a nonprofit that provides food to the underprivileged. His college-aged son came back from Scotland after school was canceled. And his daughter is a senior in high school. “She is not getting a prom or a graduation ceremony ” he said. “We’re adapting to a new reality.” None Mr. Caforio knows it is a stressful time  and is trying to be empathetic with his work force. “Some of our employees working from home were feeling almost guilty ” he said. “They were struggling about how to balance their personal needs with how to help the company. It’s OK. Right now we all have to make trade-offs.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/business/stock-market-oil-coronavirus.html,Economy Faces ‘Tornado-Like Headwind’ as Financial Markets Spiral Advertisement Supported by Crashing financial markets are increasing the risk of a vicious cycle that could usher in a recession. None The fast-spreading coronavirus and a plunge in oil prices set off a chain reaction in financial markets on Monday  a self-perpetuating downward cycle that could inflict serious harm on the global economy. What started last month as unease about a potential economic slowdown in China has evolved into a borderline panic  with the S&P 500 on Monday crashing nearly 8 percent. The mayhem is threatening to roil the underlying global financial system and the abilities of companies large and small to survive a potential economic monsoon — a downward spiral that is fed and intensified by these destructive forces. The odds of such a storm grew after an unexpected fight between Russia and Saudi Arabia. After failing to reach an agreement about how much oil to produce and sell on international markets  Saudi Arabia announced it would quickly ramp up production. Oil prices had been falling as investors fretted about a possible recession. On Monday  they plummeted over 20 percent — the sharpest decline since the first Persian Gulf war. Facing one of the worst crises since he was sworn in  President Trump — who has played down the virus threat — said he would talk on Tuesday with Republican congressional leaders about a payroll tax cut and legislation to protect hourly wage earners who may have to miss work because of the virus. He did not provide any details. The S&P 500 has tumbled 19 percent over the past few weeks  and Monday was its worst one-day decline in over a decade. The free fall has vaporized more than $5 trillion in stock market wealth. Less than 10 minutes after markets opened in the United States on Monday morning  the sell-off became so steep that automatic “circuit breakers” kicked in and halted trading. It was the first time that has happened since the current circuit breakers were set in 2013. The S&P’s 7.6 percent drop came on the 11th anniversary of the start of the current bull market  one of the longest ever. A 20 percent drop from the high point would signal what’s known as a bear market  a marker the S&P 500 has only narrowly avoided for now. The public health crisis is now threatening to turn into a financial one  which in turn could amplify the virus’s economic fallout. “There’s panic ” said Dan Krieter  an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “We’re heading into what looks to be a global recession  including the U.S.” In Asia  markets were mixed early on Tuesday  in an apparent sign that investors were trying to regain their footing  and futures markets were predicting Wall Street and Europe would open higher. Oil prices also rose about 6 percent  though they remained well below levels from last week. Still  the downward cycle — there are signs it is underway — might play out like this: As the virus disrupts manufacturing supply chains as well as travel  consumer spending would fall and businesses would falter  and stock prices would plummet. The threat to corporate profits would send investors in search of safe havens  like government bonds  sending those prices up and their yields down  in turn straining the banking industry. Banks would limit financing for businesses  which would cut production or lay off workers to hoard capital. Already  investors have hustled to safety  shunning corporate bonds and driving up the financing costs for many companies. And as they piled into U.S. government bonds  long-term interest rates fell to historic lows  benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds  whose interest rates until last week had never sunk below 1 percent  were recently yielding half that. Hoping to forestall that spiral  the Federal Reserve on Monday said it would increase the volume of short-term loans available to banks to make it easier for them to continue lending. It was the second time in a week — after an emergency interest-rate cut last Tuesday — that the Fed had moved to stem potential fallout as the coronavirus sent markets gyrating. Even for people who don’t have money in the markets  the developments are ominous. Large and small businesses hire or fire workers and buy equipment and raw materials based on their own financial strength and their expectations for how the economy will perform in the future. As companies retrench  it affects workers and suppliers  which then have to tighten their own belts. Layoffs rise  wages decline. Consumers spend less. Businesses in need of cash would normally turn to their banks for help in moments like this. But as banks get squeezed by sliding interest rates  their ability and appetite to lend to struggling companies diminish — the type of situation the Fed was trying to head off by increasing its short-term lending. At the same time  panicky investors don’t want to buy risky corporate debt  severing another potential lifeline for many companies. Investors are also yanking their money from mutual funds that invest in leveraged loans  a risky type of corporate debt that has become a popular way for many companies to finance their operations in recent years.  Investors are pulling money out of mutual funds that invest in leveraged loans.

More workers lose their jobs. Families cancel vacations and postpone big purchases. Round and round the cycle goes  further sapping the economy. “Markets want to hear that the global economy is open for business  and the problem is  it isn’t easy to say that going forward ” said Patrick Chovanec  chief strategist at the investment advisory firm Silvercrest Asset Management. It is possible  of course  that investors’ gloom will prove to be overblown. At some point  for example  the coronavirus is likely to stop spreading  it already appears to be easing in China and South Korea. If that happens soon  any economic damage from closed factories and canceled conferences and restricted travel may prove fleeting. Perhaps Russia and Saudi Arabia will quickly reach an agreement. And until they do  there is a silver lining to rock-bottom oil prices: The resulting cheap fuel will be a boon to consumers and to industries like trucking and airlines. All is not lost. Even after the decline on Monday  the S&P is still up 140 percent over the last 10 years. And the scorching bond market rally — bond prices go up as yields go down — has delivered outsize returns to many individual investors. Mutual funds and E.T.F.s holding longer-term U.S. government bonds were up 22 percent so far this year as of Friday  according to Morningstar. Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected.

A mortgage refinancing boom is underway  and many borrowers will pocket substantial monthly savings.

Governments and central banks are scrambling to defuse the precarious financial situation. In addition to the Fed cutting interest rates and making it easier for banks to borrow money  the Trump administration and Congress are discussing ways to stimulate the economy. But that is unlikely to offer much immediate help. “Many investors are anticipating fiscal stimulus within days  but that’s not typically how D.C. acts — even in emergency situations ” Henrietta Treyz  director of economic policy at Veda Partners  an investment advisory and consulting firm in Bethesda  Md.  said in a note to clients on Monday. “It takes weeks to pass even the most urgent of legislation  and there are very few ideas circulating on Capitol Hill right now.” In the meantime  the signs of stress are multiplying  especially in normally mundane corners of the financial markets. In recent days  for instance  investors that buy ultra-short-term debt issued by companies — including a popular variety known as commercial paper — have started growing jumpy. Investors like money-market mutual funds are demanding much higher interest rates. That drives up many companies’ borrowing costs  which makes it more expensive for them to operate. It also shows that institutional investors fear that an increase in corporate defaults could be imminent. The good news is that the U.S. banking industry is  over all  much stronger than it was in 2008 as an intense financial crisis enveloped the world. The energy industry  though  is shaping up to be among the hardest hit sections of the U.S. economy. Demand for energy was already set to decline with an economic slowdown. Then Saudi Arabia and Russia initiated a pricing war. Shares of companies like Marathon Oil and Apache Corporation fell more than 40 percent on Monday  while Exxon Mobil stock fell 12 percent  and Chevron slid 15 percent. Some of the companies that pioneered the shale boom  including Chesapeake Energy and Range Resources  were already in trouble  and their woes are likely to intensify. Chesapeake’s stock goes for pennies  its bonds are trading at a level that reflect investor expectations of a default. Range Resources  an early natural gas driller in Pennsylvania  is  like many of its peers there  slashing its capital spending. That is likely to hurt the local economies in which the gas companies operate — another reminder of how the economy is in danger of getting sucked into a steep  sinking spiral.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/business/stock-market-record-coronavirus.html,Stocks Shrug Off Outbreak Worries and Reach New Record Advertisement Supported by Solid economic reports and corporate earnings bolstered equity and commodity markets. None None The new high is the latest show of resilience from a market that over the last month has shrugged-off the threat of war with Iran  the impeachment trial of President Trump and  most recently  the outbreak of a fast-spreading virus that has upended one of the world’s largest economies. None “It’s fear versus greed ” said Steve Sosnick  chief strategist at Interactive Brokers in Greenwich  Conn. “Last week was fear  and this week is greed.” None Prices for copper and iron ore — key raw materials for the Chinese industrial economy — also jumped  suggesting growing optimism for the outlook on the global economy. Some attributed the rosy outlook among investors to unconfirmed reports of promising research at a Chinese university  in which some drugs had appeared to limit the spread of the virus in some experiments. The World Health Organization played down those reports  but shares rose in Asia anyway. The CSI 300 in China rose 1.1 percent on Wednesday. In Japan  the Nikkei 225 climbed 1 percent. And the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.4 percent. One factor behind this week’s rally is the effort made by the People’s Bank of China to bolster the country’s economy by pouring billions into financial markets. The expectation among investors that central bankers outside Beijing will take similar steps could also be fueling the rebound. None Investors seem to be betting that even if the coronavirus weighs on growth  central banks will prop markets up with further rate cuts and capital injections. “There seems to be a belief that you have this global central banking put  and it is just stronger than it has been over the past few years ” said Yousef Abbasi  global market strategist at INTL FCStone  a financial services and brokerage firm. “Otherwise  this sharp bounce back we’ve experienced in stocks  essentially to all-time highs  is tough to wrap your head around.” Some analysts have suggested that the market’s rebound may reflect increased expectations that Mr. Trump — who is likely to be acquitted of impeachment charges in the Senate on Wednesday — will win re-election  after the Democratic caucuses in Iowa on Monday spiraled into an inconclusive debacle. “Basically Iowa turned out to be a nonevent except for being a black eye for the Democratic Party ” Mr. Sosnick said. “The market generally is positive about that.” China’s economy has likely stalled in the face of the outbreak  but recent reports have shown — at least before the outbreak — the American economy was relatively healthy. On Wednesday  a key reading on the large American service sector showed it continued to grow in January. A separate report on private sector job growth also showed a bigger-than-expected increase. The report  from payroll processor ADP  is a precursor to the monthly release of employment data — due out on Friday — but is not considered to be strongly correlated with that data. Many companies have hinted about potential disruptions related to the coronavirus  but the actual profit numbers for the fourth quarter have been solid. Roughly 70 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far have beaten expectations from Wall Street analysts. The smell of profits has whet the appetite for stocks among investors  after markets dropped in late January. From Jan. 20 to the end of the month  a sell-off stemming from the coronavirus wiped out the 3 percent gain the market had notched through the first few weeks of 2020. Now the market has recouped all of those losses  with the S&P 500 more than 3 percent higher in 2020. The Nasdaq composite has produced even stronger gains  with the tech-heavy index up more than 5 percent so far this year. None Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/11/business/worldbusiness/london-rejects-bid-by-nasdaq.html,"London Rejects Bid by Nasdaq Advertisement Supported by None The London Stock Exchange  Europe's biggest stock market  announced yesterday that it had received and rejected a $4.1 billion informal cash offer from Nasdaq  an indication that the arms race among the world's leading exchanges is escalating. The offer comes just a few days after Nasdaq's archrival  the New York Stock Exchange  started trading as a public company  making it easier for New York to start making acquisitions. Indeed  the New York Exchange's chief executive  John A. Thain  has made no secret of his desire to be a leader in the consolidation of the world's markets. ""It's a pre-emptive strike to prevent New York from making a bid for London "" said Richard Herr  an analyst with Keefe  Bruyette & Woods. ""Now that John Thain has his currency  Nasdaq is concerned they will go pursue global consolidation."" Other exchanges have seen London as an attractive target. The Deutsche Börse and Euronext have made runs at the exchange. The overture from Nasdaq  which was not a formal offer  indicated a price of 950 pence a share  the London exchange said  a premium of 8 percent over yesterday's closing stock price of 880 pence. The board of the London exchange said the offer ""substantially undervalues the company  its unique position and the very significant synergies that would be achievable from the combination of London Stock Exchange with any exchange group."" The exchange disclosed the offer after the close of trading in London. Shares of the L.S.E. have risen 82 percent in the last 12 months. Yesterday  shares of Nasdaq surged more than 10 percent  to $43.56  while shares of the NYSE Group fell 2 percent  to $74.55. Markets have been merging because by pooling liquidity -- putting together the trading of groups of stocks  bonds or derivatives -- they can offer better prices to buyers and sellers while making more money on the increased volume of trading. At the same time  many exchanges have converted from member-owned entities to for-profit publicly traded companies and their share prices have soared. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange  for example  went public in December 2002 at $35 a share  yesterday  it closed at $428.40. London  a centuries-old exchange that went public in 2001  is a target in part because its market value is small enough to be digested by another exchange. The Deutsche Börse  while lacking the trading volume of London  has a much larger market value  of more than $13 billion  because of its profitable clearing and derivatives businesses. And London has become increasingly attractive as companies  concerned about the stringent regulatory oversight in the United States in the wake of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  have looked to list on exchanges other than the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. Of the 10 largest initial public offerings of the last year  none listed on an American exchange  according to Thomson Financial. Two listed on London. ""London is the crown jewel of Europe "" said Doug Atkin  chief executive of Majestic Research and the former chief executive of Instinet. For Mr. Thain  ""losing this chess piece to Nasdaq is a big deal."" A person close to the London Stock Exchange said New York had not made any formal overtures toward bidding for the exchange. London has an obvious allure for Nasdaq  which historically has lagged the New York Stock Exchange in attracting the largest listed companies. The market capitalization of companies on Nasdaq is $3.6 trillion  compared with $22.5 trillion on the New York Exchange. London has $6 trillion worth of companies listed on it. Nasdaq previously looked at alliances with London in 2000 and 2002  but the new offer is still something of an about-face for Nasdaq. More than a month ago  its chief executive  Robert Greifeld  denied that Nasdaq was in talks to buy the London Stock Exchange. And he has often said in the past that he is focused on trying to capture market share in New York-listed stocks and increase his own exchange's share of over-the-counter stocks. Yesterday  after being rebuffed by London  Nasdaq defended its pursuit: ""Nasdaq believes that bringing together the two organizations would present listed companies  traders and investors with an equity marketplace  based on dynamic industry leadership  to serve their needs unmatched by any other marketplace in the world."" If Nasdaq decides to pursue a hostile bid for London  it is unclear where it will find the financing. Nasdaq has $455 million in cash. It would have to turn to private equity or extend its credit line of $750 million to come up with the money for an all-cash bid. In addition to the Deutsche Börse and Euronext bids  other offers have come London's way in recent years  from Macquarie Bank of Australia and the operator of the Stockholm stock market. Last year  Deutsche Börse shareholders rejected a takeover of the London exchange and ousted its chief executive  Werner Siefert. Macquarie made a £1.5 billion hostile offer in November 2005  but walked away last month after shares of the London exchange soared 50 percent. ""Since 2004  people have been trying to buy London without too much success "" Mr. Herr of Keefe Bruyette said. The London exchange received a letter from Nasdaq on Thursday night. No talks had been going on  and people at the exchange were surprised at the lack of a warning  said a London-based executive who was briefed on the offer. ""Clearly  this is unsolicited  unexpected and is unwelcome "" he said  requesting anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the offer. ""In spite of the travails of the past 15 months  the L.S.E. has been looking to build the business  has been delivering record trading  and developing international primary market."" Nasdaq's interest in London comes at a time when it is still integrating Instinet  the electronic exchange it acquired about the same time the New York Stock Exchange planned to merge with the electronic stock operator Archipelago. J. P. Morgan Chase and Greenhill & Company are advising Nasdaq. The law firm of Skadden  Arps  Slate Meagher & Flom is also representing Nasdaq. Merrill Lynch is the lead defense adviser for the London Stock Exchange and Lehman Brothers is a co-adviser. Few believe that London's rejection is the end of it. Indeed  Nasdaq's bid is expected to prompt the Big Board to spring into action. A New York Exchange spokesman declined to comment. ""I would imagine dinner plans are being canceled "" Mr. Atkin  the former Instinet chief  said. Advertisement ",articles/business
https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/nasdaq-blames-a-surge-of-data-for-trading-halt/,"Shutdown at Nasdaq Is Traced to Software None The Nasdaq OMX Group  the parent company  on Thursday released preliminary findings that provided the clearest official insight into what caused the trading halt  being called in trading circles as the “flash
                                        freeze.”  While stock prices were little affected when the exchange reopened late in the afternoon of Aug. 22  the episode reignited concerns about the fragility of modern markets and their dependence on intricate software systems. In particular  a series of attempts by a market operated by the NYSE Euronext to connect with the Nasdaq system that reports the prices of recent trades generated a surge of data. That led to a failure of Nasdaq’s
                                        backup systems  forcing the market to go offline to fix the problem. “Our job here is obviously to reduce as much as we can any trouble we have  but we certainly understand that code has this nefarious way of working and then not working ” Robert Greifeld  Nasdaq’s
                                        chief executive  said in a telephone interview. “Our job then is to mitigate the impact.” According to Nasdaq  the trouble began just after 10 a.m. on Aug. 22 when Arca  one of the exchanges run by NYSE Euronext  began having trouble connecting with the system that provides prices for recent trades in Nasdaq
                                        stocks  which Nasdaq operates. Arca tried to connect more than 20 times to the system. As part of its standard procedure  it also sent over a number of zero-dollar quotes  meant to ensure that no stale trades would be sent out to the market. All told  the data sent greatly exceeded the amount that Nasdaq’s system — known as the Securities Information Processor  or SIP — was intended to handle. People with direct knowledge of the matter
                                        said that Nasdaq’s system was not designed to “throttle ” or forcefully slow down  the flood of information. That meant that the data was hitting the SIP at full force. Ultimately  Nasdaq turned off Arca’s access to the system around 11 a.m. By 11:17 a.m.  Arca’s systems appeared to be working fine. But the immense amount of data sent by Arca overwhelmed Nasdaq’s SIP  prompting the system to resort to backup servers. A flaw in the backup software then emerged  forcing Nasdaq to shut down the entire system.
                                        At 12:14 p.m.  the exchange sent a notice to traders notifying them of the complete market halt. Nasdaq fixed the problem within 30 minutes of halting trading  but it took additional time to contact other markets and regulators. Trading resumed around 3:30 p.m. Mr. Greifeld noted specifically that he was not blaming Arca for the shutdown  accepting responsibility for Nasdaq’s share of the problems. He also pointed to what he described as broader issues affecting the stock market industry as a whole  including information security and data capacity. “They obviously had issues  and it caused an event ” Mr. Greifeld said  referring to the NYSE exchange. “We obviously had issues  we should be able to handle that. We were supposed to be able to fail over  and we did not.” A NYSE Euronext spokesman  Richard Adamonis  declined to comment. But a person close to the exchange said that it was reviewing its backup systems. At the same time  executives at the Big Board’s parent have complained that Nasdaq initially did not adequately acknowledge responsibility for the problem last week. On Thursday  Nasdaq said that it was “deeply disappointed” in its performance on Aug. 22 and called it “unacceptable to our members  issuers and the investing public.” Mr. Greifeld  who has staunchly defended Nasdaq’s response to the market halt amid criticism that the company offered little information about the troubles  added that the market operator was studying additional
                                        ways to post information in real time. They include using social media like Twitter  other ways of automatically posting information  and opening up additional phone lines for market participants to hear directly
                                        from Nasdaq officials. The preliminary report on Thursday is far from the last word on the subject. Nasdaq is set to meet with an industry group to discuss the issue next week. Officials from both exchanges are scheduled to speak with the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission  Mary Jo White  on Sept. 12. None ",articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html,Stocks Slide as Texas Rolls Back Reopening Advertisement Supported by This briefing is no longer updating.  Stocks tumbled Friday  with losses accelerating after Texas said it would reinstate some measures aimed at curbing the coronavirus outbreak there  a move that added to investors’ concerns that a recent surge in Covid-19 cases would put a halt to the economic recovery. The S&P 500 was down more than 2 percent  a loss that erased any remaining gains the index had for the month of June. Though stocks started the day only slightly lower  the selling quickly picked up pace after the governor of Texas ordered all bars to close on Friday  a day after he paused the state’s reopening amid surging cases there. Shortly after Texas’s announcement  Florida’s governor also ordered bars in that state to stop serving food and alcohol for on-site consumption. “The Texas response to close bars and restaurants is a the real driver of lower markets today  as it portends to a possible second shutdown across the country if we see Covid spikes ” said Doug Rivelli  president of institutional brokerage firm Abel Noser in New York. “And a second shutdown would be devastating to the overall economy.” None None None Markets have seesawed all week as new data made clear that the United States is far from bringing its coronavirus outbreak under control. At the same time  mass infections breaking out in a number of European and Asian countries underscored the fact that the disease will be a fact of life until vaccines become widely available. Still  investors have also seen signs of recovery in economic data. Consumer spending data released on Friday by the Commerce Department showed a sharp increase of 8.2 percent in May  as businesses started to reopen. Several analysts also pointed out that recent weakness in the stock market could be related to the approach of the end of the second quarter on Tuesday. Institutional investors — such as pension funds — typically rebalance their portfolios at quarter end  resulting in sales of assets that have outperformed. Stocks are up roughly 17 percent in the second quarter  trouncing the roughly 2 percent gains for the broadest measure of the bond market. “Money managers will look to take profits and lock in gains ahead of quarter end ” Steven Ricchiuto  U.S. chief economist  Mizuho Americas  wrote in a note to clients on Friday. “Doing so before the weekend allows them to better enjoy the more seasonal weather rather than worry about the markets.” None They stepped up  it turns out  giving more and giving faster then they typically do.

Debra Mailman  who has spent the two years since she retired as an executive at Microsoft volunteering in disaster zones  initially slowed her giving  shocked by the sudden drop in value in the investments in her donor-advised fund. “At the beginning of the pandemic  I did the same thing everyone did: I looked at the stock market and said  ‘Oh  my God ’” she said. “Then I held my nose and said  ‘Forget that — the money isn’t mine anymore. It will do more work out there.’” Consumer spending rose by a record 8.2 percent in May  the Commerce Department said Friday  as businesses began reopening and the economy slowly started to recover. The increase followed record drops in spending in March and April at the start of the coronavirus pandemic  when businesses were shuttered and millions of Americans lost their jobs  sending the economy into a recession. The report showed that the spending came despite personal income dropping 4.2 percent in May  the most since January 2013  after surging by a record 10.8 percent in April when the government handed out one-time $1 200 stimulus payments to millions of people and bolstered unemployment benefits. Spending by consumers is closely watched because it accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity in the United States. A surge of new infections  however  is causing some businesses to close once more  and could affect the recovery. Economists cautioned against reading much into last month’s surge in consumer spending. They noted that the increase followed two record declines and that it still left spending 11 percent below its pace before the pandemic hit. “Amid rapidly rising infections across many states  risks to the outlook are dangerously tilted to the downside ” Gregory Daco  chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics  said in a research note. The commerce report showed that among the categories for which consumers ramped up spending in May  the sharpest increase — a 29 percent jump — was for durable goods such as autos. Spending on a category called nondurable goods  which includes food and clothing  rose nearly 8 percent. And spending on services — everything from cellphone contracts to hospital visits — rose more than 5 percent.

So-called interior horticulturalists water — and occasionally pet — the plants every few weeks  tending to a patch of the American economy. “Most people just call me the plant guy when I walk in ” said Mac Rogers  an interior horticulturalist with Cityscapes  which designs and maintains interior landscapes. “It’s kind of eerie going into spaces when there’s nobody around ” he said. “Now  there’s a lot less air movement.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/business/stock-market-earnings-coronavirus.html,After a Staggering Rally  What’s Next for Stocks? Advertisement Supported by A lot will depend on what companies have to say about how their businesses are faring. Many have skipped giving quarterly earnings guidance in recent months. None Catch your breath and stay hydrated  stock market investors. It’s only halftime  and the second half of 2020 could go either way. During the first six months of the year  stocks experienced their biggest quarter-to-quarter swing in more than 80 years. First  the coronavirus pandemic and an unprecedented shutdown of the economy sent stocks on one of the fastest declines on record. Then  giant helpings of government stimulus not only stopped the sell-off but sent stocks charging to their best quarterly performance in more than two decades. Where they go next is a mystery. There’s so much uncertainty about the coronavirus crisis that roughly 40 percent of the S&P 500  about 200 companies  have withdrawn their customary forecasts about how their businesses will perform in the months ahead  according to data from S&P Capital IQ. The companies’ silence has unnerved analysts  who have already axed their expectations for profit growth substantially. They’re now expecting that second-quarter profits will fall more than 40 percent  according to numbers compiled by the data provider FactSet. That’s an ugly forecast  but investors face a crucial question: Is it ugly enough? “The numbers are sort of all over the place ” Lori Calvasina  head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets  said of analysts’ predictions. For much of the second quarter  which ended on Tuesday  fear of the unknown didn’t seem to matter. The S&P 500 rose nearly 20 percent in the best calendar quarter for the broad market index since 1998. Stocks were up nearly 45 percent at one point after the S&P 500 bottomed on March 23  and the sizzling performance made the market appear out of step with the depth of the uncertainty facing the economy and American companies. But there is nothing Wall Street hates more than uncertainty  and lately the rally has cooled and trading has gotten rockier as investors turn their gaze to the rest of the year. Although a few bounces were mixed in  stocks slid roughly 4 percent over the last three weeks. None Without the earnings guidance they’re accustomed to  analysts and investors will have to wait for the quarterly earnings reports — which will start to arrive in bulk in the middle of July — for any sort of hard data on how the pandemic is hitting the bottom lines of major corporations. Expectations for corporate profits are heavily reliant on the outlook for the economy  which remains very much at the mercy of the outbreak. The virus has already sunk the United States into its worst recession since the Great Depression  with roughly 20 million Americans receiving unemployment benefits. There have been promising signs: In May  numbers on everything from unemployment to manufacturing to retail sales showed sharp rebounds. Though they still showed the economy in a deep recession  those figures helped buttress hopes for a strong snapback in activity premised on rising hopes that the virus could be contained. But that premise has crumbled over the past few weeks. Officials have reported sharp upticks in cases in many states  especially in areas of the South and West that were largely untouched when the virus first flared in the United States in March. Those new outbreaks have prompted a number of states to pause — and some  like Texas and Florida  to roll back — efforts to normalize economic activity. Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected.

But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None None There’s another source of unease: what policymakers will do as the pandemic persists. Some explain the surge in stocks largely as a result of the huge amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus the federal government threw at consumers and financial markets as the virus started to freeze up much of the economy. The Federal Reserve months ago signaled its willingness to do pretty much anything necessary to keep markets functioning smoothly and provide support for the economy. The central bank pumped more than $2 trillion into the financial system  largely by buying government-backed bonds  but it has also started buying relatively small amounts of corporate bonds. Analysts remain confident that the Fed will continue providing such support for the foreseeable future. But they’re less sure what to expect from Congress and the Trump administration. None None None Jonathan Golub  chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse  said investors appeared to be nearly certain that additional fiscal stimulus would be coming out of Congress  but that any significant delays could add to the market’s jitters. “How they get extended is going to be extremely important ” he said.

President Trump’s company owed the German bank a total of more than $300 million  most of which was on loans related to the Trump National Doral golf resort in Florida and the Trump International Hotel in Washington. None The Trump Organization rejected the proposal  which officials concluded was not worth taking  the people said. Deutsche Bank officials — which were wary of doing a financial favor for a president whose administration oversees the bank — were surprised that the Trump Organization did not accept the offered relief  however modest it might have been. This is not the first time that the Trump Organization has sought to rework its debts to Deutsche Bank. In 2008  during the global financial crisis  the Trump company was due to repay a loan that had financed the construction of the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago. After Deutsche Bank refused to extend the loan’s due date  the Trump Organization sued the bank  blaming Deutsche Bank for causing the financial crisis and arguing that it constituted a contract-voiding act of God. That lawsuit was eventually settled  but Deutsche Bank stopped working with Mr. Trump for a few years. The relationship was restarted in 2012 when the bank agreed to make a number of loans to the Trump company  including $125 million to finance the Doral golf resort. None The president cited the pandemic  saying that the visa programs “pose an unusual threat to the employment of American workers.” None Technology firms  which account for the bulk of H-1B visas  were particularly aghast.  None None None None Over the past several years  hospitals began to play innkeeper to open the door to more elective surgery  which is the lifeblood of their revenue. They developed hotels near their operating rooms where patients  who often came from overseas for specialized treatments  could recover comfortably. Expanding into the hospitality business also allowed health care providers to avoid the high costs of being hosts themselves. But as with so much else  the coronavirus pandemic has devastated medical tourism. To allow doctors to focus on emergencies  hospitals have canceled hip replacements and tummy tucks  while flight bans have grounded many foreign visitors. None Yet hospitals  whose costs have mounted as the pandemic dragged on  may have little choice but to revive the sector  according to some developers  who are forging ahead despite the uncertainty. “We want to be focused on the entire patient experience ” said Ana Lopez-Blázquez  an executive vice president at Baptist Health South Florida  which owns the Miami hospital. The Walt Disney Company has decided to close Disney English  a 12-year-old chain of 25 language schools in China  ending a once-promising business that  at times  prompted questions about education as brand building. None Mahesh Samat  Disney’s executive vice president of consumer products commercialization in the Asia-Pacific region  told parents in a letter on Monday that Disney English had made the “difficult decision” not to reopen. The chain was founded in 2008  when China’s fast-growing middle class had created increased demand for English-language learning. Disney developed the curriculum in partnership with Columbia University. He added that Disney was “taking care of each and every” teacher affected by the decision but did not specify how. Advance-paid tuition will be refunded. The learning centers  aimed at children ages 2 to 12  charged roughly $2 000 annually for about 100 hours of instruction. None But the chief executives of some of these businesses are doing just fine. Companies that are struggling to pay creditors and suppliers are managing to find millions of dollars to pay bonuses to their bosses. The payments  which are made just before a bankruptcy filing  appear to be legal and have been made by several companies. None Companies have said the payments are meant to help them retain qualified executives through the recession and bankruptcy. But critics counter that the money would be better spent on rank-and-file employees. Walmart said on Tuesday that it was removing all Mississippi state flags from its stores  saying the decision was consistent with the company’s positions not to sell “merchandise with the confederate flag.” With the move  the nation’s largest retailer joins universities  businesses and athletic organizations that are putting pressure on officials in Mississippi to change the state flag’s design. “We believe it’s the right thing to do  and is consistent with Walmart’s position to not sell merchandise with the confederate flag from stores and online sites  as part of our commitment to provide a welcoming and inclusive experience for all of our customers in the communities we serve ’’ the company said in a statement. It is part of a broader effort to root out symbols of the confederacy including statues of confederate generals and other monuments from public parks and government property. The battle flag of the Confederacy is on vivid display at the heart of Mississippi’s flag  but previous efforts to alter the design have faltered. All eight of Mississippi’s public universities have stopped flying the flag  along with cities across the state. Walmart stopped selling merchandise that displayed the confederate flag in 2015  following the murder of nine black parishioners in a South Carolina church. After lagging behind its competitors in starting clinical trials  the French drugmaker Sanofi plans to speed a vaccine development timeline that could yield approval from regulatory authorities sometime next year  perhaps in the first half of 2021  the company said on Tuesday. The company and its partner in the endeavor  GlaxoSmithKline  originally projected that a vaccine would be available in the later half of next year at the earliest. Like other contenders in the race for a coronavirus vaccine  Sanofi is eager to push forward. Still  “such fast-tracking and intense scale of vaccine production is totally unprecedented ” and the future unknown  said Padmini Pillai  an immunologist at M.I.T. None None In news briefings on Tuesday  both companies expressed confidence in their collaboration and its potential to deliver a successful vaccine. Sanofi’s history with vaccine development runs deep: Its production lines are responsible for hundreds of millions of doses of the flu vaccine each year. None Stocks on Wall Street rose along with global markets  as investors zeroed in on signs of economic recovery and the prospect for another round of stimulus spending by the government. The S&P 500 rose less than half a percent. As they have done for several days recently  technology stocks fared even better than the broader market  with the Nasdaq composite returning to a record. The gains came after a turbulent night for financial markets around the world  after one of President Trump’s advisers seemed to suggest that a trade deal between the United States and China had been scrapped. But after Mr. Trump took to Twitter  and his surrogates appeared on television to clarify the statement  stocks quickly recovered. Lifting sentiment were initial surveys of corporate purchasing managers that echoed other signals of a rebound underway in the United States  Britain and Europe. The IHS Markit composite purchasing managers index for the United States rose to 46.8 in June  up from 37 in May. A reading under 50 still signals economic contraction. “The second quarter started with an alarming rate of collapse but output and jobs are now falling at far more modest rates in both the manufacturing and service sectors ” Chris Williamson  chief business economist at IHS Markit  said in a statement accompanying the data. “The improvement will fuel hopes that the economy can return to growth in the third quarter.” Investors were also emboldened by expectations for another round of stimulus spending by Washington. A White House economic adviser  Larry Kudlow  said that it could include “tax rebates and direct mail checks ” even as he cautioned that nothing had been settled. The trading day began on a more volatile note. On Monday evening  Peter Navarro  Mr. Trump’s trade adviser  said “it’s over” when asked in an interview on Fox News about the trade war pact that was reached between the United States and China in January. The pact had eased trade tensions between the two countries but has since become a source of investor concern. China pledged to increase purchases of American agricultural products and other goods under the pact  but its struggles with the coronavirus pandemic put those promises into doubt.

About 14 percent of people being tested for the virus in South Carolina are positive  up from about 5 percent a month ago. None None “This announcement prompted an intense and immediate outcry from our customers  and it is clear from this response that we did not go far enough on the usage of masks ” the company said in a statement. “At AMC Theatres  we think it is absolutely crucial that we listen to our guests. Accordingly  and with the full support of our scientific advisors  we are reversing course and are changing our guest mask policy.” None None None “Our current mask policy is to mandate for both employees and guests ” said Ken Thewes  chief marketing officer for Regal. “Our ultimate goal is to create a safe environment for our guests and employees. This is a change to our previous policy on masks based on feedback received from our customers.” The chain said that disposable masks would be made available to customers who need them. None None None The new disclosures will apply to loans of more than $150 000. The information will be broken down into five loan ranges  topping out at the maximum amount of $10 million. The Small Business Administration will release business names  addresses  demographic data and jobs supported. The Treasury Department  which jointly administers the loan program with the S.B.A.  did not say when the new information would be made public  however  some of the demographic data will be included in loan forgiveness applications  which might not be submitted for months. “I am pleased that we have been able to reach a bipartisan agreement on disclosure which will strike the appropriate balance of providing public transparency  while protecting the payroll and personal income information of small businesses  sole proprietors  and independent contractors ” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. Federal Reserve officials on Friday warned that the U.S. economic outlook remained wildly uncertain  as parts of the country see a new surge in coronavirus infections. “So far  in the United States efforts to contain the virus have not been particularly successful ” Eric Rosengren  president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  said in a speech on Friday. With the spread of the disease continuing “and the acceleration of new cases in many states  I expect the economic rebound in the second half of the year to be less than was hoped for at the outset of the pandemic.” The downturn could persist — or worsen — but Randal K. Quarles  the central bank’s vice chair for supervision  said the Fed would determine capital requirements — essentially the financial cushions they must keep to withstand losses — based on economic scenarios developed before the pandemic took hold. The Fed will test the strength of banks against multiple dire economic situations that reflect how the virus might play out  but it will not publish bank-specific results. “We don’t know about the pace of reopening  how consumers will behave or the prospects for a new round of containment ” Mr. Quarles said. “There’s probably never been more uncertainty about the economic outlook.” Given the serious risks  the Fed’s annual “stress tests ” the results of which will be released next week  will include three sensitivity analysis scenarios. These would look at how the banking system would fare in the case of a V-shaped recovery  in which output and employment bounce back quickly  a U-shaped rebound  in which jobs and growth take a long time to recover  or a W-shaped trajectory  in which a second wave of the coronavirus forces activity to collapse again  Mr. Quarles said. All week long  two competing narratives faced off on Wall Street. Investors were encouraged by signs that the reopening of businesses is having an immediate positive effect on the economy. But they were battered by worry over a growing number of coronavirus infections around the country. None None The decision by Apple had an immediate impact on the market  with shares of companies that are likely to benefit from a return to normal — airlines and retailers  for example — immediately giving up their gains. “The markets started to slide as soon as Apple announced they were closing 11 stores due to Covid spikes ” said Doug Rivelli  president of institutional brokerage firm Abel Noser in New York. “That stoked fears that the economic restart might not be a smooth as people had hoped  and we could be in for a longer period of stagnation.” Investors also heard a warning from Eric Rosengren  the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and an influential policy maker within the central bank system  who cited the rising caseloads in South Carolina and Florida as he warned of the economic impact of states reopening before the coronavirus was under control. Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent  after it hit 14.7 percent in April  which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None Mr. Rosengren said that because of the virus’s continued spread “and the acceleration of new cases in many states  I expect the economic rebound in the second half of the year to be less than was hoped for at the outset of the pandemic.” None Still  despite the unease among investors  the market notched a gain for the week with the S&P 500 up nearly 2 percent. If there is one thing that is almost always guaranteed in an economic downturn  it’s an increase in litigation. Businesses are going to sue businesses. Tenants are going to sue landlords  who will sue their tenants right back. Insurance companies will contest claims  and start-ups will try to defend their intellectual property from more established companies. Yet in this recession  one industry that was just getting started during the 2008 downturn has come into its own and is attracting wealthy investors looking for outsize returns. Meet litigation finance  an esoteric  high-risk investment strategy that lures with the siren song of double-digit returns. It’s an industry with a few publicly traded behemoths  but it remains the preserve of private-equity-style funds that invest in cases  back law firms and act as financial intermediaries when settlements have been reached. And the pandemic could be its time to emerge from its little-known niche. “We have the wind to our backs in this unusual environment ” said Howard Shams  the chief executive of Parabellum Capital and an early practitioner in the industry. None Consider Patti Hanks  62  who recently had ovarian cancer treatment. With her immunity low  she was nervous about returning to her workplace  a store where she would be drawing up financing plans and taking cash payments from customers. The cancer makes her particularly susceptible to severe complications should she contract the virus. But Ms. Hanks was even more worried about losing her health coverage if she did not go back. Finding a job with health benefits that allowed her to work from home felt like a pipe dream given the economic downturn. So despite her reservations  she returned to work. She wears a mask and makes sure customers sit a good distance away at an L-shaped desk. Pre-existing conditions may motivate other workers like Ms. Hanks to return to work especially fast. Those people need coverage to treat the conditions that make them vulnerable in the first place. In the United States  61 percent of working-age adults get health insurance through work. “It is one of the many ways the U.S. health care system has made us so much more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic than other countries ” said Larry Levitt  executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “In other countries  you don’t hear about people losing health insurance when they lose their jobs.” None None Reporting was contributed by Alan Rappeport  Katie Robertson  Mihir Zaveri  Gillian Friedman  Daisuke Wakabayashi  Jeanna Smialek  Keith Bradsher  Chris Buckley  Sarah Kliff  Mohammed Hadi  Niraj Chokshi  Jenny Gross  Mike Ives  Brooks Barnes  Gregory Schmidt and Kevin Granville.

None Mr. Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration. From the Department of Curiosities: On Tuesday  as the number of new coronavirus cases continued to spike to record levels  the stock market closed out its strongest quarter in more than two decades. None This year’s volatility may be extreme  but it’s only the latest of many seeming disconnects between stocks and the economy. In March 2009  for example  while reported monthly job losses were topping 700 000  share prices abruptly ended their 17-month decline and began a recovery that essentially lasted until the virus arrived.

Why has an economy that has experienced the biggest collapse since the Great Depression not — at least to date — inflicted any lasting damage on a market that is often expected to reflect the state of the economy or  at least  of corporate profits? Some hold the view that the economy’s troubles will be short-lived  a V-shaped recovery will soon unfold and the stock market is merely looking ahead. Others cite the upsurge in buying by small individual investors. My vote for the most significant driver of stock prices is the huge amount of liquidity that the Federal Reserve has injected into the financial system  in an effort to counteract the depressive economic impact of the virus. That has pushed interest rates to record lows  turning money market funds  bonds and other fixed-income instruments into low-returning investments. The Standard & Poor’s index of 500 stocks  for example  currently has a dividend yield of 1.9 percent  compared with 0.7 percent for 10-year Treasury notes. Unusually  an investor can now make more in current income from stocks than from high-quality fixed-income securities while participating in any future appreciation in share prices. (Yes  while stocks can also go down  over the long term  they have always appreciated.) None “Don’t fight the Fed” has been a mantra for investors for decades. During the tenure of Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman  the notion that the Fed would provide a fire hose of liquidity whenever a crisis threatened became known as the “Greenspan put.” None None However  as a whole  data on fund flows do not show — at least yet — enough new retail money coming into the market to materially account for its quick and strong recovery. And the overall strong performance of stocks masks the fact that the market has recognized that profits of fast-growing technology companies have not been significantly hurt by the pandemic while more cyclical companies in manufacturing  retail and the like are suffering mightily. Since the market peaked on Feb. 19  the tech-heavy Nasdaq index is up four percent essentially unchanged while the Dow Jones average — more oriented toward cyclical companies — has fallen by 12 percent. None In recent days  the market has seemed sympathetic to their view. As virus cases have begun spiking  stock prices have shuddered  as they did on Friday  June 26. But so far  at least  they have quickly stabilized  albeit below the highs of early June. So at the moment  as much as President Trump would like to think otherwise  lofty stock prices are not a sign of a strong economy. And in the long run  the view of professional investors that share prices must eventually align with economic fundamentals will prevail. To me  those fundamentals look scary. The new climb in virus cases threatens to force shutdowns and delay reopenings. At best  the recovery is likely to be lengthy  particularly for industries including travel and hospitality. Without a robust economy  corporate profits are unlikely to recover fully  eventually pulling down stocks. To know when that recovery might occur  keep a close eye on the path of the virus. But also  don’t forget to watch the Fed. Advertisement ,articles/business

None The data  which the Trump administration released under pressure from lawmakers and watchdog groups  offered the most detailed look yet at the sectors and businesses that took advantage of a program aimed at keeping workers on the payroll amid virus-induced shutdowns. Yet the information released on Monday was confined to companies that received loans of more than $150 000 through the Paycheck Protection Program  while the administration said that 86.5 percent of the loans were for less than that amount. More than 40 000 full- or limited-service restaurants received loans worth as much as $32 billion. Physicians offices received loans worth as much as $19 billion. Total loans were as much as $17 billion for car dealers  $13 billion for law offices and $5 billion for dentists. Plumbers  religious organizations and schools also headlined the list.  Dozens of tenants at buildings owned by President Trump or managed by his companies received loans — raising the likelihood that Mr. Trump may have indirectly benefited from the government support. Of the $521 billion allocated through the Paycheck Protection Program  about $68.2 billion — roughly 13 percent — went to companies in California. Another $41.1 billion flowed to Texas businesses. Nearly 5 000 businesses received individual loans between $5 million and $10 million  according to the data. The administration included ranges for the loan amounts  not specific figures. The data showed that more than 3 000 companies said they would be retaining 500 employees  exactly the program limit. None The Paycheck Protection Program offers businesses with 500 or fewer employees loans that can be forgiven if the employer meets certain conditions  like using the bulk of funds to pay employees. The information released on Monday was confined to companies that received loans of more than $150 000  offering just a partial picture of where the money went. Here are some of the businesses the Treasury Department said received loans. None None None None None None Wall Street’s gains continued for a fifth straight day on Monday  with technology stocks leading the rally as investors continued to brush off signs of a resurgent coronavirus amid hopes for more government spending to bolster the economy. None After a turbulent stretch in June  stocks have steadily recouped nearly all of their losses from that period with a rally that has lifted the S&P 500 by more than 5 percent in a week.  That run has defied a growing number of coronavirus cases around the United States and new measures to contain the virus that include shutting down some businesses again  partly because of new data that showed the economy was regaining its footing.  Last week figures showed that employers added nearly five million workers back to payrolls in June  home purchases rose sharply and consumer confidence jumped. On Monday  the Institute for Supply Management said activity in the U.S. services sector rebounded last month. Investors also expect lawmakers in Washington to authorize more government spending to offset further economic damage. Though the specifics of any spending plan — and the timeline for it — are far from certain  the White House on Monday suggested it would back more spending. None Still  with economists warning that the recovery could be slower than markets currently expect  the rally is susceptible to a sudden change in sentiment if indicators shift. One trigger for that shift could be the upcoming earnings reporting season  when many companies will address the financial impact of the coronavirus for the first time in months.  None For years  flight schools  airlines and experts encouraged people to become pilots. They promised young recruits a job that was lucrative and secure because thousands of pilots in their late 50s and early 60s would retire in the coming years and demand for travel would continue growing. None None Airlines could lay off  furlough or reduce the hours of tens of thousands of pilots  cuts that would disproportionately fall on those who have less union seniority and training. Major airlines have already stopped hiring pilots after posting hundreds of openings in the first quarter of the year  according to Future & Active Pilot Advisors  a consulting firm. Several companies are offering buyout packages to avoid deeper cuts later. Southwest has acknowledged in discussions with its pilots union that the airline is likely overstaffed by more than a thousand pilots. The company is offering several years of partial pay and benefits to those who agree to leave the company temporarily or permanently. Delta warned last week that it could furlough nearly 2 600 pilots and is offering early-retirement packages. Some pilots said the turmoil was nerve-racking  but those who have been in the profession for a while have come to expect it. None None On a typical Sunday  when patrons at Julien Cornu’s cheese shop in Paris load up on Camembert and chèvre for the week  about half would pay by digging into their pockets for euro notes and coins. But in the era of the coronavirus  nearly everyone at La Fromagerie chooses to pay with plastic. “They don’t want to have to touch anything ” Mr. Cornu said. While cash is still accepted  even older shoppers — his toughest clientele when it comes to adopting digital habits — are voluntarily making the switch. The coronavirus is accelerating a shift toward a cashless future  raising new calculations for merchants and enriching the digital payments industry. It is a golden moment for credit card companies  banks and digital platforms  which are capitalizing on the crisis to encourage consumers and retailers to use cards and smartphone apps that yield lucrative fees. None None None Food delivery apps  which connect drivers  restaurants and customers  have grown quickly in recent years  fueled by venture capital and armies of contract workers.

It’s enough to move the market  analysts say. None When he wasn’t coaching sports  he was playing them or watching them. And if he was watching — well  a little skin in the game always made it more interesting for Steven Young  a teacher outside Philadelphia. Just small-dollar bets  mixed in with shuffling the rosters of his fantasy teams. But when the coronavirus pandemic hit  all the games he cared about sputtered to a stop. So he turned to one of the last places in town for reliable action: the stock market. Mr. Young withdrew all the money from his sportsbook accounts and deposited it into Robinhood  the free stock-trading platform. When his federal stimulus check arrived  he put money from that in  too. Forced into online lessons when his school district shut its doors  the health and physical education teacher had everything he needed to get into the market. “Having the time and the flexibility and the opportunity — it being as low as it was — I just kind of felt it was a good time ” he said. None “There’s zero doubt in my mind that it is a factor ” said Julian Emanuel  chief equity and derivatives strategist at the brokerage firm BTIG. “Zero doubt.” Millions of small-time investors have opened trading accounts in recent months  a flood of new buyers unlike anything the market had seen in years  just as lockdown orders halted entire sectors of the economy and sent unemployment soaring. It’s not clear how many of the new arrivals are sports bettors  but some are behaving like aggressive gamblers. There has been a jump in small bets in the stock options market  where wagers on the direction of share prices can produce thrilling scores and gut-wrenching losses. And transactions that make little economic sense  like buying up the nearly valueless shares of bankrupt companies  are off the charts. Even with modest investments  these newcomers can move stock prices  which are typically set by just a sliver of shareholders. On most days  the overwhelming majority of stock investors do nothing  while the buyers and sellers establish the prices. So even a small influx of hyperactive speculators can have a significant effect. “Investors are increasingly asking us about the participation of individual investors in the shares and options market ” analysts from Goldman Sachs wrote in a note published late last month. “Our data suggests that individual investors are indeed a significant proportion of daily volume.” Jim Bianco  president of Bianco Research  a financial market research firm  said gamblers were a small but important segment of those new arrivals  along with video game aficionados. “Is it as big as what would we refer to as the institutional community?” Mr. Bianco asked  referring to mutual funds  exchange-traded funds and professional investors. “Probably not.” But  he added  “it is big enough to matter.” None “Basically  I needed something to try to gamble on or to try to make some money on ” said Sean Moore  a 23-year-old aircraft electrician living in Suisun City  Calif. With an initial investment of about $1 000  he has experienced all the highs and lows of playing the market in just a few weeks. Mr. Moore’s bets on airlines and casino companies surged roughly 60 percent in about a week. “I was telling everybody: ‘You got to do stocks. Sign up — it’s easy money right now ” he said. But then a bet he made on the casino company MGM — premised on the reopening of Las Vegas after coronavirus restrictions were lifted — went south. “It did not go positive like I thought it would ” he said. “I thought that was going to be huge with them reopening.” None When the coronavirus shuttered Barstool’s Manhattan offices  Mr. Portnoy — who had almost no stock trading experience — reinvented himself as “Davey Day Trader.” With an initial outlay of $3 million  he started buying and selling from his apartment and streaming the results to his loyal readers. “I have a pretty good feel for when something is entertaining content for them ” said Mr. Portnoy  whose streaming sessions mix confident pronouncements with colorful profanity. It didn’t start out so well: Mr. Portnoy lost more than $1.5 million on repeated bets that the market would fall. He put in more than $2 million more and turned into a raging stock market bull  clawing his way back to positive territory. The short-term swings make betting on stocks no different from betting on a game: “Same rush ” he said. While Mr. Portnoy has been a considerable influence on Mr. Moore  Seth Serrano was tipped off by someone close to him: his brother. Stocks have replaced sports as their main topic of conversation.

A modest bettor — only a dollar or two on a game — he keeps a portfolio worth only about $200. He freely admits he started out with little idea of what he was doing  but he naturally gravitated to a classic stock-market strategy: Purchase stocks that have fallen and hope to sell them on the rebound — “buying the dip” in trader parlance. “I don’t know what half this stuff is ” Mr. Serrano said as he scrolled through his portfolio  reviewing holdings that included Ford Motor  some pharmaceutical shares and a somewhat obscure E.T.F. that tracks the price of the fertilizer potash. He also has a stake in a business he knows well: DraftKings  the gambling service he formerly used. The company went public in April  and Mr. Serrano figured its shares would spike once games restarted. He didn’t have to wait that long: DraftKings is up some 245 percent this year  even without games to wager on. “Basically I’m  like  gambling on my gambling ” Mr. Serrano said. The last time Americans showed any serious appetite for stock-market speculation was the tech-stock frenzy of the late 1990s.

Many have 401(k) plans filled with the plain-vanilla index funds that are the bedrock of retirement planning  and they put down only what they’re willing to lose. “They’re not expecting to retire off of trading stocks ” said Josh Brown  chief executive of Ritholtz Wealth Management  who has been following the growth of retail activity this year. “They’re having fun and they’re learning the market  and I think it’s great.” Mr. Young started out buying index funds  but he has grown more adventurous as he has picked up more knowledge. He’s subscribing to investing channels on YouTube  and finds himself reading financial news in Barron’s and The Wall Street Journal. “It’ll be interesting ” he said  “when sports come back  how invested I am in sports.” Advertisement ,articles/business

None Simply enumerating the crises afflicting the United States this year is an exhausting job. None Enough already  right? But there’s more. Even if  by some serendipitous twist  the shocks of 2020 stopped right now  the United States would face predictable traumas already locked in the calendar — most notably an election season of monumental vitriol and consequence that has barely begun. None None Equities have seldom moved as sharply down and then up  from quarter to quarter  as they have this year. Calling the stock market a “roller coaster” is a cliché  yet if the term were ever apt  it would be so now. This particular sequence of extreme movements — a remarkably bad quarter  followed by a remarkably good one — makes this market noteworthy from a historical standpoint. In the United States since 1928  there has been only one instance when the stock market declined at least 20 percent in one quarter and rose at least 20 percent in the next  according to data supplied by Bespoke Investment Group  an independent market research firm. That was in the heart of the Great Depression in 1932  an era of misery and staggering unemployment. It’s not a year that anyone wants to see again. But in financial markets  this year has looked painfully similar. The S&P 500 was on track to echo the market of 1932. After falling 20 percent in the first three months of this year until June 21  it had risen more than 21 percent in the second quarter. Stocks have declined a bit since then  amid new flare-ups of the coronavirus and fresh warnings about the weakness of the economy  and the quarter doesn’t end until June 30. Even so  the stock market is flirting with an unenviable distinction. Stocks have declined at least 15 percent in one quarter and risen at least 15 percent the next only eight times  and seven of them were during the Great Depression. (The singular post-Depression quarters were in 1970  during a Nixon-era recession.) It would be easy to simply rejoice at the market’s outsize gains. But there were far better quarterly returns — two quarters with gains of more than 80 percent — in 1932 and again in 1933  back in the Great Depression. These echoes of the Great Depression are disturbing for many reasons. It’s not just that unemployment stayed above 12 percent for nine years in that dismal period  or that  despite some periodic improvements  the economy was mired in a long-term slump that didn’t end until World War II. None In fact  despite those glorious streaks in the 1930s  it took 20 years for the stock market to rise above its 1929 peak and stay there  when you include dividends and inflation  Professor Shiller has found. Imagine if that happened today. Investors would be living in a world of pain. It wouldn’t be until 2040 that the stock market crossed the peak reached in February (again  dividends and inflation included). Such parallels can be overdrawn  of course. For comfort  emphasize that the current era is very different. “What’s unique about this period is that the stock market is hostage to the health data ” said Paul Hickey  a co-founder of Bespoke. “Coming into the fall  I think  the economy and the stock market are going to be dependent on how the health numbers come out  and unfortunately none of us know the answer to that.” Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent  after it hit 14.7 percent in April  which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None It is quite possible that once the coronavirus pandemic is behind us — whenever that may be — the stock market and  more important  the real economy will flourish. Those assumptions are certainly built into current stock market prices. None But Hertz’s assessment of the stock market climate seemed on the mark. It wanted to take advantage of a “unique opportunity” — the current day-trading frenzy. None Even when stocks make sense in the pandemic  exuberant traders have been pushing prices to stratospheric levels. Zoom Video has become a household name because of the coronavirus  but its earnings are small. Does it really merit a price-to-earnings ratio of 1 421.4 — Apple’s is 28.3 — and a gain this year of more than 270 percent? Depending on your point of view  traders have either ignored the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus — or had the wisdom to focus on the earnings that will flow once the pandemic ends. Critiques of current market prices are increasingly common. David Solomon  the chief executive of Goldman Sachs  said on Wednesday  “The equity market does seem to be a little bit ahead of my view of the future earnings performance of businesses.” He added that he expected price declines “over time.” Stay strong. The year isn’t even half over. Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/business/economy/central-banks-economic-warning.html,A Truce  Not a Peace Treaty: A Global Economic Body Warns of Risks Advertisement Supported by Tame markets do not mean the path back to prosperity will be seamless  warned the Bank for International Settlements  which supports the world’s central banks. None None “The success of central banks in calming markets and shoring up confidence has even helped spark some market exuberance ” the global group  which supports the world’s central banks  said in the Tuesday release. In a nod toward the recent disconnect between financial markets and the economy  the group said high stock prices and the lower premium on corporate debt suggested a divergence from the reality of economic weakness. “Underlying financial fragilities remain ” the group said  adding that “this feels more like a truce than a peace settlement.” The coronavirus pandemic roiled markets in March and April  as countries outside Asia began to lock down operations and it became clear that the health crisis would inflict pain upon major economies other than China’s. Central banks responded rapidly as businesses and individuals scrambled to sell assets and raise cash  and the real-world crisis began to infect financial markets — making it hard for corporations to issue debt and difficult to trade even U.S. Treasury securities  which are usually highly liquid. Monetary policymakers bought huge sums of bonds and stepped into new markets as lenders of last resort  intent on staving off a full-fledged meltdown. Investors were soothed  and they began buying stocks and debt again as they became confident that the Federal Reserve and its global counterparts stood ready to provide a backstop. Global stock indexes have rallied  and corporations have been issuing debt at a breakneck pace. But now they might be overdoing it  the Bank for International Settlements and its leaders warned. None “Importantly  the shock to solvency is still to be fully felt ” Mr. Carstens said  warning that banks  which have extended loans to companies and consumers  will find themselves on the hook as businesses crash  taking workers down with them. That situation  the group warned  could be “triggered by cliff effects as initial fiscal support runs out and payment moratoriums expire.” The report said that a surge in corporate defaults “is on the cards” and that such an event would “call for prompt and orderly debt restructuring ” along with other action from elected leaders with spending and lending powers. If such problems are widespread  time-consuming bankruptcies could be a poor way to deal with them. “Governments could play a useful but delicate role ” the report said. “This could range from setting some broad directions for restructuring to introducing some abbreviated  less granular processes  or possibly taking equity stakes in firms.” The report also pointed to other vulnerabilities. Thanks to the U.S. dollar’s dominance in global commerce and finance  the Federal Reserve had to step in to calm global funding markets as conditions deteriorated in March. The “huge scale” of the Fed response points to a vulnerability in the global monetary and financial system “when contrasted with the much smaller firepower of international organizations” like the International Monetary Fund  the report said. It said emerging market economies must rely on a “fragmented combination of mechanisms” to meet their liquidity needs in times of crisis until a “lasting political and practical solution” is found. Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected.

None None Mr. Carstens also urged central bankers to fix vulnerabilities in the financial sector outside the banking system  known as shadow banking. While global regulators strengthened banks after the 2008 financial crisis  now “they need to help ensure that the nonbank financial sector optimally supports the real economy over the medium term ” he said. If there is good news  according to the Bank for International Settlements  it is that formal banks — both the origin and the amplifier of the 2008 crisis — have performed better this time around  absorbing big balance sheet inflows and meeting credit line drawdowns  in some cases with the help of regulatory easing. “A silver lining in this sobering picture is the state of the banking system ” the report said. “The pandemic found banks much better capitalized and more liquid  thanks largely to the post-crisis financial reforms coupled with a more subdued expansion.” None The Fed stopped short of barring banks from paying dividends next quarter  as some lawmakers and former regulators have urged — a decision that drew public criticism from one of the Fed’s governors  Lael Brainard  who said not taking stronger measures could “impair the recovery.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/your-money/rental-car-companies-hertz-coronavirus.html,Used Cars From Shrinking Rental Fleets May Not Be the Steal You Expect Advertisement Supported by your money adviser While there are good deals to be found  particularly in the wake of Hertz’s bankruptcy filing  buyers shouldn’t count on fire-sale prices  experts say. None The coronavirus and the related drop-off in travel have pummeled the rental car industry. That means car shoppers may find deals on used vehicles this summer as the rental companies trim their fleets — but not necessarily bargain-basement discounts. None None The additional rental cars for sale  along with a steady stream of cars coming off lease agreements  may push down prices for used cars  said Jeff Schuster  president of Americas operations and global forecasting at the research firm LMC Automotive. “It’s good for consumers ” he said. But the auto market is complex and economic conditions remain in flux  so used-car experts say they can’t predict the size of any discounts shoppers may see. None It’s uncertain how much Hertz’s bankruptcy will affect prices over all. Hertz’s fleet comprises more than half a million vehicles in the United States  and a big influx of cars at one time would probably affect prices  Mr. Schuster said. But the holdings represent a small fraction of the roughly 40 million used-car transactions that occur each year  Mr. Rahim said. “It isn’t enough to put huge downward pressure on prices ” he said. Plus  it’s uncertain how many Hertz cars will end up on the market. Chapter 11 proceedings allow companies to reorganize and keep operating  rather than liquidating holdings. Hertz’s various outlets  including its Dollar and Thrifty locations  remain open for business. George Chamoun  chief executive of ACV Auctions  which conducts online used-car appraisals and auctions  attributed the rebound in vehicle values to more demand for used cars as people avoided public transportation and ride-hailing services out of concern about the virus. Used-car values in some states are nearly back to where they were before the pandemic  he said  and in some — like Florida — are higher. But even as some people are buying cars to commute to work  others may be continuing to work at home  which may reduce demand for cars. Auto manufacturers cut production in response to the pandemic  and that may push more buyers to used models  buoying demand — and prices. All of that doesn’t mean there won’t be deals to be had  Mr. Rahim said  but consumers shouldn’t count on fire-sale prices. None But rental cars  especially smaller models  which are typically less expensive to rent  may have more miles on them than other used cars  iSeeCars reported. The average mileage on Hertz cars sold in May was 31 percent higher than on used cars from typical dealerships. But luxury cars  which are less popular rental options because of their expense  often have “significantly” lower mileage than average. Here are some questions and answers about buying a used rental car: What are the pros and cons of buying a car from a rental agency? Rental cars have many drivers  some of whom may not have treated the vehicle as gently as they would their own car. For that reason  buying directly from a major rental company may be preferable to buying from smaller outlets  which tend to buy used cars from the big companies and hold on to them for another cycle of rentals  said Jon Linkov  deputy auto editor at Consumer Reports. “It’s had a life already ” he said. “Best to stay away from the third life.” Most big rental companies replace their cars when they are one to two years old  but most warranties expire after a certain number of miles  Mr. Linkov said. So even if the model is relatively new  the time left on the manufacturer’s warranty may be limited. Still  Mr. Linkov said  it’s wise to register a used car with the manufacturer  if there is any time left on the original warranty  to make sure you get notices of recalls and other updates. The rental companies typically include limited warranties with their used vehicles. Hertz  for instance  offers 12 months or 12 000 miles  but that warranty is likely to be worthless if Hertz goes out of business  experts said. Also  rental companies may not offer the most feature-laden models  Mr. Linkov said  so they may lack desirable safety options like blind-spot monitors and forward-collision warnings. But because rental companies have increasingly tried to match their fleets with consumer taste  they may offer for sale models beyond the stereotypical “compact plastic box ” including sport utility vehicles  light trucks and luxury vehicles  said Jessica Caldwell  an analyst with the automotive website Edmunds. How do I buy a car from a rental agency? None Hertz has 90 sales locations and offers home delivery in 21 states  delivery is free within 75 miles  with fees of up to $1 000 for greater distances. Avis offers home delivery at 14 sales lots. Enterprise offers it in some areas  according to its website. The companies typically offer at least a few days for buyers to drive the car and return it if it doesn’t meet expectations. Mr. Linkov suggested having a trustworthy mechanic inspect the car during that time. What financing terms are available on used-car loans? The average used-car loan in the first three months of this year was $20 273  up from $20 137 from a year earlier  according to Experian Automotive. The average interest rate fell to 9.65 percent  from 10.06 percent. None Mr. Linkov advised approaching the purchase of a used rental car as you would any used car: Line up financing ahead of time so you aren’t forced to use the agency’s financing if your preapproved rate is lower.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/science/space-balloon-trips.html,They Want to Sell Balloon Rides 19 Miles Up. Haven’t We Heard This Before? Advertisement Supported by Seven years ago  entrepreneurs planned trips to the stratosphere  but tourists never got off the ground. They’re trying again. None None Those journeys never happened. But on Thursday  those same entrepreneurs are back again  announcing the start of a new company with a similar sounding name  Space Perspective  to offer the same vision. Despite years of promises  the business of space tourism largely remains a dream of the future. Although seven ultrawealthy people have spent tens of millions of dollars each to visit the International Space Station  companies aiming to open up outer space to more people have yet to lift a single paying passenger. The founders of Space Perspective insist that their business plan is sound — offering the sights of space to those who would prefer a leisurely  hourslong cruise to a giant roller coaster ride where the excitement is over in minutes. “It’s so gentle ” said Jane Poynter  who shares the chief executive title with her husband  Taber MacCallum  at the new company. “It’s much less dynamic than a rocket-based flight. I know that there’s a lot of people that either cannot or don’t want to go on a rocket  but they really want to go to space.” None Last year  as World View transitioned from start-up to maturing business  Ms. Poynter and Mr. MacCallum stepped away from day-to-day operations. They are still minority owners. Then they revisited their original dream. In many ways  the Space Perspective trips mirror World View’s intended journeys. A giant balloon lifts a capsule holding a pilot and passengers from the old space shuttle landing strip at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Space Perspective’s design has space for eight paying customers  one more than World View had intended to carry — to an altitude of 100 000 feet. “We ascend under the balloon at a blazing 12 miles an hour ” Mr. MacCallum said. “So it takes us about two hours to get up to the float altitude.” That is only about one-third of the way to the 62-mile altitude that is often considered the boundary of outer space  but it is still high enough to see that our planet is indeed round. Ms. Poynter said the price for a ride would be more expensive than the $75 000 that World View had planned to charge  probably about $125 000. The new design is simplified. Instead of trying to steer by finding winds blowing in the desired direction  Space Perspective’s balloon will lift off and head in the direction of that day’s winds. By letting out some of the hydrogen that makes the balloon lighter than air  the craft slowly descends to a splashdown in either the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico. The craft will have a parachute to allow a safe return if the balloon somehow deflated. Ms. Poynter said Space Perspective has to obtain enough investment for its initial development work  including an uncrewed test flight in the first quarter of next year. If all goes according to plan  the first flights with passengers might take off around the beginning of 2025  nearly a decade after the target date the founders had set for World View. None None “We have done a lot of hard things in our day ” Mr. MacCallum said  “and some have worked out and some of them haven’t. And  some of them were  ‘Wouldn’t it be fantastic?’ Maybe low probability  but worth giving it a shot like Inspiration Mars.” Ms. Poynter said a marketing study that Space Perspective commissioned found that roughly 2 million people would be interested in their balloon trips  potentially a market worth a quarter of a trillion dollars. “Which is really good ” she said. But getting to space on a budget has been harder and slower than many expected  and the market remains untapped. Some companies went out of business long before their spaceships were complete.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/business/trump-opportunity-zone-jobs.html,A Trump Tax Break Is Not Spurring Job Creation  Study Finds Advertisement Supported by A report on opportunity zones finds that a tax incentive President Trump credits with revitalizing black communities has mostly helped real estate developers. None None None Opportunity zones are spread across the country  in rural  urban and suburban areas that state and local officials selected  under criteria set out in the law  as in need of additional investment and economic growth. The zones offer tax advantages to investors who take the proceeds of a capital gain  like the sale of stocks or a family business  and invest them through a fund into a qualifying project in a designated zone. The report praises the zones for catalyzing a “new community development ecosystem” of Americans who want to invest in hard-hit areas. But it finds that entrepreneurs eager to start businesses and community-oriented projects are struggling to connect with the investors who stand to reap tax benefits. Many of the developers interviewed for the report made clear that their projects would have proceeded even without the tax incentive  the report finds. The tax break allows investors to roll capital gains from other investments into funds that seed projects in the zones. Taxes on those original gains are deferred and  if the investment is held for several years  can be sharply reduced. “Although there are compelling examples of community benefit ” the researchers conclude  “the incentive as a whole is not living up to its economic and community development goals.” None None None Many of the zones are in predominantly black neighborhoods  which have long struggled to attract businesses and investment. Mr. Trump has made the tax break a centerpiece of his pitch to black voters and part of his claims  which are not supported by evidence  that he has done more for the black community “than any president since Abraham Lincoln ” as he wrote on Twitter this month. The report finds that black communities “are particularly engaged” with the opportunity zone program. Its authors  Brett Theodos  Jorge González and Brady Meixell  said they interviewed many black entrepreneurs who have sought funding for projects in the zones and note not all of them have succeeded. They report that some black entrepreneurs attribute those difficulties in part to longstanding patterns of discrimination by the wealthy — and largely white — investor class. The authors say those investors are primarily focused on high-return projects in the zones  like luxury real estate development  rather than lower-margin projects that could bring jobs and services to black communities. “While some black developers report positive interactions with the program ” the authors wrote  “the experience of exclusion is also consonant with research suggesting that funds led by high-performing black men are the most harmed by racial bias from asset allocators  even when all other fund aspects are identical.” Mr. Theodos said that black project sponsors often reported that they didn’t have the social networks needed to connect to investors. “But it’s more than that ” he said in an email interview. “The O.Z. incentive just isn’t deep enough to entice most investors to make impact investments.” The report suggests several changes to incentivize such investments  including redesigning the program to benefit a wider array of businesses and linking its benefits to concrete measures of success  like job creation. Supporters say the report shows the zones are beginning to bring in new investors and interest to underserved communities  and that it is too soon to judge their success in driving investment in companies  and not just condominiums  office buildings and hotels. “The report makes clear that opportunity zones are catalyzing a new ecosystem of community development  but beyond that  you can’t fairly judge a 10-year-plus program after its first year of meaningful investment ” said Steve Glickman  who helped to develop the program and now runs an advisory firm for investment in the zones  Develop LLC. “When you spend time in these communities ” Mr. Glickman said  “you realize that many of them need real estate and infrastructure development before businesses can move in and get established.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/article/police-tasers.html,Tasers: Are These Police Tools Effective and Are They Dangerous? Advertisement Supported by The fatal police shooting of Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta has put a spotlight on a number of officer tactics  including the use of stun guns. None None None “During the chase  Mr. Brooks turned and pointed the Taser at the officer ” the authorities said  adding that “the officer fired his weapon  striking Brooks.” Kalfani N. Turè  an assistant professor of criminal justice at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut  said the shooting of Mr. Brooks was what was known in police circles as “lawful but awful.” That is  he said  officers are trained that they have the right to escalate their use of force if they believe someone is threatening to incapacitate them. In the case of Mr. Brooks  Professor Turè said  other options were available to the officers: Identify Mr. Brooks through his car and track him down later  for instance  or call for backup to help apprehend him. The episode has put a spotlight on a number of police tactics  including the use of Tasers. Here are some answers about the devices. Axon Enterprise  formerly known as Taser International  makes the most popular brand of stun gun  the Taser. The name “Taser” has become synonymous with the stun gun  much as “Band-Aid” is used as a catchall term for adhesive bandages. Stun guns  which have been used by law enforcement for decades  can temporarily immobilize a person — think of someone who is combative or resisting arrest  for instance — by jolting them with 50 000 volts of electricity. None As Dennis J. Kenney  a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan  put it  “Your muscles freeze up  and down you go.” None The device can be used from a distance or in “drive mode ” in which the charge is driven directly into a person’s body at close range  said Robert J. Louden  a professor emeritus of criminal justice and homeland security at Georgian Court University in New Jersey. When a Taser is fired from a distance  prongs or darts connected by wires are discharged at a person. In those cases  Tasers have a reliable range of about 10 feet  Professor Kenney said  but beyond that  their effectiveness in hitting a target becomes spotty. None The largest number of deaths were in California (92)  Florida (65) and Texas (37). In a 2008 review of hundreds of deaths after stun gun use  Amnesty International found that 90 percent of those who died were unarmed. Most of the deaths were attributed to causes unrelated to stun gun use  but medical examiners listed the devices as a contributing factor in more than 60 deaths  Amnesty International said. “Even if deaths directly from Taser shocks are relatively rare  adverse effects can happen very quickly  without warning  and are impossible to reverse ” Kristina Roth  senior program officer for criminal justice programs at Amnesty International USA  said on Sunday. None The study looked at the records of eight people who went into cardiac arrest after they received shocks from a Taser X26 from a distance. Seven of the people died. Axon Enterprise said in a statement on Sunday that “any loss of life is a tragedy regardless of the circumstance  which is why we remain committed to developing technology and training to protect both officers and the community.” Tasers were marketed as a “panacea ” one that would help officers deal with noncompliant individuals  said Professor Turè  who previously served in three law enforcement agencies in Georgia  including the State Police. Tasers are a class of “less than lethal” tools designed to improve what Professor Kenney said were the “midrange options” for officers. Before Tasers  officers’ options were at the extremes — relying on verbal commands or the use of deadly force with a firearm. Another approach  such as hand-to-hand combat  is a “perishable skill” that requires constant training  he said. “What are my options?” he said. “I would roll around on the ground with you: I’m going to lose as many of those as I’m going to win.” Axon says the devices save lives and prevent injuries. “Our mission is to protect life and we prioritize safety above all else ” the company said in its statement. “Taser weapons are not risk free but they are proven safer than batons  fists  take downs  tackles and impact munitions.’’ None The devices can bring an abrupt halt to a confrontation and disable an uncooperative person  but if they are discharged and don’t work — or even when they do — sometimes the effect can be to make things worse. If a person is angry  under the influence of alcohol or drugs  or has a mental illness  the use of a Taser can exacerbate those conditions and inflame a situation  said Joel Feinman  the chief public defender in Pima County in Arizona. “When you look at who these things are being deployed against  this is a tool of escalation  not de-escalation ” Mr. Feinman said. “Now the police officer is thinking: ‘Now that didn’t work. Now I have to use the other tool attached to my belt  which is a 9-millimeter handgun.’” None None In addition  in more than a third of the cases  the person became more aggressive after the device was used  which may have contributed to an escalation of the incident. Professor Louden said a person’s physical stature — height and weight — and how amped up they might be on adrenaline can play a role in being resistant to the effects of less-than-lethal methods. Professor Louden  a former hostage negotiator for the New York Police Department  recalled once trying to deal with a barricaded person with a mental illness who had a machete taped to his hand. Officers used mace  he said. “He took I don’t know how many canisters to the face  and it had no effect ” he recalled. In the case of someone who is high on a mind-altering drug like PCP  also known as angel dust  Tasers are ineffective. “They walk right through it ” Professor Turè said. Problems also surface even when the prongs successfully latch onto a person. Tasers are most effective when connecting to light clothing but are less so with heavy winter gear  like a leather coat. Sometimes  only one prong will attach  and sometimes the devices are not properly charged  experts said. Part of the underlying problem is that the police culture does not emphasize methods to defuse situations  Professor Turè said. He said that in his 200 hours of training to become a police officer  192 hours were dedicated to the use of force and only eight to de-escalation. Police departments have their own policies and practices for when Tasers should be deployed  he said  and there is no reliable universal data tracking their use. “Despite the choppy evidence of their effectiveness ” he said  “you have 18 000 police departments not really in any conversations with each other.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/opinion/coronavirus-global-cooperation-cities.html,The World Is Helping Americans Who Don’t Always See It Advertisement Supported by Cities and states are using international support to cope. They need to plan for global partnership to recover. None Ms. Hurlburt directs New Models of Policy Change at New America. None None None It’s not that the plans excluded international experts. Contributors include prominent global health scholars  diplomats and at least one former cabinet member with significant international responsibilities. Several of them referenced international experience in implementing test-and-trace schemes or taking tentative steps to end lockdowns. Only one — the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute — mentioned support for fighting the disease abroad as a long-term necessity to sustain health at home. But none seemed to think local and national officials could gain anything from foreign counterparts in real time. That blind spot reflects a larger failing in how American thinkers and institutions continue to divide the world between home and abroad  against all evidence that such walls are either porous or illusory. None In our daily lives  we benefit from — but do not see — a web of international cooperation on everything from mail to air traffic to entertainment  not to mention disease surveillance. The international economy  in particular  we view as an immutable force of nature  rather than an environment we can shape with policy or consumer choices. None Yet the latter two efforts might be much more helpful to rebuilding health infrastructure and trust in local governments here at home. Offscreen  too  rigid divides between domestic and international policy persist across the academy and the professions. It remains not only possible  but preferred  to get a doctorate in U.S. politics or public health without taking an “international” class — or to study “international” economics  development or politics without ever learning the U.S. system deeply enough to compare. None None Those efforts will be central to recovery. Whether federal authorities step up or the responsibility remains local  massive amounts of equipment and supplies from abroad will be needed as plans to test everyone  offer antibody therapy and care for more sick people in isolated clinical settings come on line. None None Taken together  those steps will help U.S. communities recover faster and more sustainably from the pandemic. They will also do something much larger — point the way toward a new kind of internationalism  in which the high politics and geostrategy of the Cold War are replaced by practical  local-led cooperation. International diplomacy  rather than being a specialty practiced by a dwindling and underfunded corps of State Department officials in Washington  would be understood as a critical component of leadership in many walks of American life. We’ve already seen what this looks like in two fields often seen as archrivals — international business and global climate policy. At the highest levels in industry  tech and finance  some international experience and connections are a career necessity rather than a detriment. In climate advocacy  global coalitions connect U.S. cities and states directly to foreign governments and international organizations. When governments won’t  climate NGOs collaborate across borders to develop shared agendas. The system of state-led international cooperation we’re used to began 75 years ago  with a group of leaders building processes where they thought the need was greatest. Some of them were experts in international affairs  but some of cooperation’s greatest champions  like Eleanor Roosevelt  were not. It would be a significant silver lining if the coronavirus  which has shattered science’s expectations about how viruses should behave  could also shatter a stale set of post-Cold War expectations about how international relations serve Americans in our daily lives.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/fashion/watches-canada-wood-sustainability.html,In Canada  Watches From Wood Advertisement Supported by Companies like Tense Watches use small pieces that otherwise might be thrown away. None Residents of British Columbia are known throughout Canada for their fierce protectiveness of the province’s natural resources  so it should come as no surprise that a watch company based there prides itself on creating timepieces from reclaimed wood. None “The company is an advocate for sustainability and has been since the beginning ” Ms. Liebholz said. It generally buys wood from sources  like a furniture maker  that purchase scrap wood from logging enterprises. “We can use much smaller pieces than they can  so it makes sense ” Ms. Liebholz said. “With a piece of wood the size of a notebook  we can make two watches.” Tense Watches are made from a mix of hardwoods  to create varied looks. There are common types of wood  such as walnut  bamboo and Canadian maple  as well as more exotic selections  like zebra wood. All the woods  the company said  are tested for quality to ensure there are no internal flaws. None Of course sustainability alone does not prompt the sale of enough watches to make a company profitable  but  Ms. Liebholz said  the watches are popular because wood is hypoallergenic  allowing people with skin conditions to wear them without adverse effects. Wood is also lightweight  she said  and it interacts over time with the natural oils of a wearer’s body to  in essence  mold the watch to the wearer. Many of the models are customizable  allowing the purchaser to choose the dial  hands and strap. In Canada  Tense is not alone in creating watches that feature wooden cases or bracelets. None None When Mr. Lau started Tense Watches  he did all the designing and fabrication — often creating pocket watches with wooden cases and dials. In 2012  however  he turned the business over to his daughters  Frances and Anna. Now  Frances Lau designs the company’s timepieces with a computer program  and periodically introduces new designs based on a fashion trend or a look that she likes. Last year  for example  the company introduced a line of 26-millimeter miniwatches and added a chronograph to meet customer demand.

None None Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook’s chief executive  ordered employees to ramp up and focus on the company’s own video chat projects  especially as use of its products also increased  said three people with knowledge of the plans  who declined to be identified because the details are confidential. On Facebook’s internal message boards  employees openly gawked at public data showing Zoom’s growing popularity  they said. On Friday  Facebook unveiled one of its biggest expansions into videoconferencing with several new video chat features and services. They included video group chats for as many as 50 people on Facebook Messenger  WhatsApp video calls for up to eight people and video calls in Facebook Dating. None None Facebook  Google and others want a piece of that success. Behind the scenes  people with knowledge of the companies said  employees are sore that they have not grabbed more of the same buzz as Zoom  especially since many of the giants have offered their own video chat software — like Google Meet — for years. None In an interview  Mr. Zuckerberg chafed at comparisons to Zoom and said video chat was just beginning to be a larger phenomenon as people aimed to digitally connect in more intimate ways. “The world was already trending in this direction before Covid-19 ” Mr. Zuckerberg said while using the new Facebook Messenger video product. “This is the trend in general — the ability to feel more present  even when you’re not physically together.” Zoom’s chief executive  Eric Yuan  said in an interview this month that his company was not thinking about competition and was focused on users and their experience during a “once in a probably 100 years crisis.” Zoom  founded in 2011 by Mr. Yuan  a former Cisco executive  was designed to be easy to use and install. Unlike other video chat products  the app also has a popular grid view that lets people see everyone on a call at once  creating a more social atmosphere. The company  based in San Jose  Calif.  went public last year. When the spread of Covid-19 turbocharged the video chat phenomenon  Zoom emerged as a clear front-runner  owing largely to word of mouth about its ease and simplicity. It has been the most downloaded app in Apple’s App Store for more than a month. The company is valued at around $47 billion  more than Slack and Pinterest. None Bigger tech and telecom companies are racing to catch up  even though they were earlier to roll out videoconferencing services. Cisco acquired Webex in 2007 for $3.2 billion. Facebook has long hyped its own video chat offerings. Microsoft bought the internet calling service Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion. None None None “As the largest enterprise security company in the world  we’re helping our customers connect and collaborate  securely ” he said. None None Few companies have been as attuned to Zoom’s rise as Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg recently galvanized several Facebook teams to accelerate their video chat product releases  including a desktop app for Facebook Messenger — which has a video chat feature front and center — this month. More than 700 million people now make calls across Messenger and WhatsApp each day  Mr. Zuckerberg said  making it clear that other features needed to be built in as soon as possible. Those include Messenger Rooms  a way to quickly create video chat rooms using Facebook Messenger that can support dozens of people simultaneously. Facebook also integrated video chat into its Dating product and plans to bring the ability to create Rooms to WhatsApp  Instagram Direct and other services. Mr. Zuckerberg said Zoom felt more scheduled and a little less casual than Messenger Rooms. He said he wanted to make the video chat experience more serendipitous. Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent  after it hit 14.7 percent in April  which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None “I don’t really think there’s anything today that you can display on an ad hoc basis that you’re hanging out and have whoever wants to join you over video ” he said. “Sometimes people compare what we do to other companies  like you did earlier with Zoom. I think the main thrust of how people are going to experience Rooms will be very different.” Facebook’s augmented and virtual reality division  which offers a video communications device called Portal  has also been working with Zoom since January on a partnership so people could make Zoom video calls on the gadget  according to three people with knowledge of the company’s plans. None Facebook’s augmented and virtual reality division is also in discussions with other companies to expand video chat partnerships  two of the people said. Press officers for Facebook and Zoom declined to comment. Yet Zoom may already be too ingrained for Silicon Valley’s giants to dislodge.  Late last month  Philipp Schindler  Google’s chief business officer  held a videoconference with thousands of the search giant’s employees using Google Meet  three people who attended the call said. During the session  one employee asked why Zoom was reaping the biggest benefits even though Google had long offered Meet. Mr. Schindler tried placating the engineer’s concerns  the people said. Then his young son stumbled into view of the camera and asked if his father was talking to his co-workers on Zoom. Mr. Schindler tried correcting him  but the boy went on to say how much he and his friends loved using Zoom. A Google spokesman declined to comment on the episode.

None “My sense is that this is a caldron ” said Ralph Reed  the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and a veteran organizer of the religious right. “It is simply unsustainable to tell people that they have to sit helplessly in their homes watching their businesses go bankrupt  their jobs disappear and their lives destroyed.” None Speaking of Democrats  he said  “If they’re not careful  they will take what they think is going to be a referendum on Donald Trump and turn it into a referendum on the denial of basic freedoms and liberties.” While tensions have flared in the last week  competing political agendas have shaped how leaders approached the enforcement of coronavirus-related restrictions in the past month.

None None None None The idea of targeting the black business community was novel  but Mr. Graves pitched it with confidence befitting the multimillionaire publisher and businessman he would become. “I was just another entrepreneur who believed in himself ” Mr. Graves told The Post-Standard of Syracuse  N.Y.  in 2005. “The only difference was that I was black.” None Black Enterprise  which featured profiles of African-American businessmen and women  advice on navigating the corporate world for young professionals and an annual list of the most successful black-owned companies  proved popular. In time it became a combination of publications like Forbes  Money and Fortune aimed at African-American readers. Earl Graves Jr. said that the magazine’s print circulation peaked at around half a million in the early 2000s. None In 1997 Mr. Graves published “How to Succeed in Business Without Being White: Straight Talk on Making it in America ” which he wrote with Wes Smith. The book  a New York Times best seller  included concrete lessons on networking  maximizing career opportunities and building wealth gleaned from Mr. Graves’s lifetime of entrepreneurship. It also emphasized that Mr. Graves saw the goal as an equal chance at success rather than special treatment. “The white-dominated business world needs to understand that we don’t want charity ” he wrote. “We want to do business. We don’t want guaranteed success. We want the opportunity to earn it.” Earl Gilbert Graves was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 9  1935  to Earl Graves  an immigrant from Barbados  and Winifred (Sealy) Graves  who was from Trinidad. He grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. His father worked in the garment industry and his mother was a homemaker.

In “How to Succeed in Business "" Mr. Graves wrote that when he was a student at Morgan State and told acquaintances that he hoped to be a successful businessman  they often reacted with incredulity because “the concept of a black businessman with his own corporation” was “largely a foreign  even a laughable  one to blacks as well as whites.” None Kitty Bennett contributed research.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/05/business/china-medical-supplies.html,China Dominates Medical Supplies  in This Outbreak and the Next None Government support and protectionism have built a low-cost industry making masks  testing kits and other health gear. Other countries will find it tough to compete. None Supported by None None When the outbreak subsides  those factories may struggle to survive. China has laid the groundwork to dominate the market for protective and medical supplies for years to come. Factory owners get cheap land  courtesy of the Chinese government. Loans and subsidies are plentiful. Chinese hospitals are often told to buy locally  giving China’s suppliers a vast and captive market. Once vaccines emerge  demand will plummet. Factories will close. But Chinese companies are likely to have the lowest costs by far and be best positioned for the next global outbreak. “The Chinese have been successful weaving global personal protection equipment dominance with supply-chain command and control ” said Omar Allam  a former Canadian trade official trying to establish production of in-demand N95 medical respirators in his country. China’s grip on the market is a testament to its drive to dominate important cogs in the global industrial machine. For years  China’s leaders have worried that the country depended too much on foreign sources for everything from medical supplies to microchips to airliners. It has used subsidies  economic targets and other government inducements to emerge as a powerhouse in those important industries. When Chinese leaders grew concerned about pollution and dependence on foreign oil  for example  they helped local makers of solar panels  wind turbines and high-speed rail equipment clobber the competition. They have taken similar steps to dominate industries of the future  like the next generation of wireless data transmission  known as 5G. The state’s heavy involvement in its economy has led to waste and graft that could slow China’s growth. But the policies have often proved effective in building industries that can withstand losses and tough foreign competition. Medical supplies may be similar. “There will be massive consolidation after the epidemic ” said Howard Yu  a professor of management and innovation at the Institute for Management Development  a business school in Switzerland. “It will be exactly the same dynamics as in green energy  5G and high-speed rail.” Before the pandemic  China already exported more respirators  surgical masks  medical goggles and protective garments than the rest of the world combined  the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated. Beijing’s coronavirus response has only added to that dominance. It increased mask production nearly 12-fold in February alone. It can now make 150 tons per day of the specialized fabric used for masks  said Bob McIlvaine  who runs a namesake research and consulting firm in Northfield  Ill. That is five times what China could make before the outbreak  and 15 times the output of U.S. companies even after they ramped up production this spring. None “It is a huge mistake to assume that the market will disappear ” Mr. McIlvaine said. Ma Zhaoxu  vice minister of foreign affairs  said that from March through May  China exported 70.6 billion masks. The entire world produced about 20 billion all of last year  with China accounting for half. None None China  however  has a head start. None China also foresaw the importance of nucleic acid test kits  which can detect coronavirus infections. In 2017  the Ministry of Science and Technology identified the kits as a “targeted development” industry. None Chinese makers of medical gear enjoyed generous government subsidies. Shenzhen Mindray  a maker of ventilators and other intensive care equipment  received up to $16.6 million a year over the past three years  according to company documents. Winner Medical  a mask manufacturer  received $3 million to $4 million a year. Guangzhou Improve  a producer of masks and test kits  received $2.5 million to $5 million a year. Shenzhen Mindray and Winner Medical declined to comment  while Guangzhou Improve did not respond to numerous requests. Hospitals began to buy locally. Three years ago  the central government required purchasers to buy from domestic producers that could meet requirements. Local governments followed. Sichuan Province  for example  cut in half the number of categories for which medical equipment and supplies could be imported. Only the top hospitals could import anything  the provincial government said  while lower-ranked hospitals had to buy everything in China. At least three other large  populous provinces — Liaoning  Hubei and Shandong — made similar announcements. Such efforts helped put China firmly at the front of the industry  as Rakesh Tammabattula discovered. An entrepreneur in the Los Angeles suburbs  he shifted his business making nutrition supplements and moisturizer to the production of medical masks and hand sanitizer in response to the epidemic. To do that  he needed a machine that could compress and cut fabric to make masks. Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected.

But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None He discovered that the machines were made only in China. He had to charter a jet to fly the huge device — 36 feet long  six feet high and five feet wide — from southern China to Los Angeles. “It’s not that we can’t make this ” said Mr. Tammabattula  the chief executive of QYK Brands. “It’s just that we haven’t focused on it.” The Chinese government played a major role in this year’s medical-equipment build-out. Sinopec  a state-owned Chinese oil company  said it had worked closely with the Chinese Communist Party as it set out to build a factory to make the particle-trapping fabric needed for surgical masks and respirators. At one site  600 engineers and workers labored in shifts day and night for 35 consecutive days to build a factory that would normally take a year to construct. A “party member assault team” worked 20 hours straight on Feb. 26 to prepare a warehouse for the project  according to the company. Officials also accelerated efforts to make land available for new factories. The city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province transferred 1.6 acres to the Jiande Chaomei Daily Chemical Company on Feb. 15 for an emergency expansion of respirator production. Lanxi  a county in Zhejiang  transferred land to the Baihao New Materials Company by the end of February for respirator production. Officials in Guangdong Province and the city of Jinan in Shandong Province approved more lenient land policies for medical supply businesses as well. Government support for the medical supply industry is continuing. Guangzhou Aoyuan Biotech Company decided this year to expand from its usual business of making disinfectant into the manufacture of N95 masks. A top local official immediately visited the company  arranged land for it in an industrial park and approved all of the necessary forms. A few economic policy experts in China contend that their country may be going too far. According to Tianyancha  a Chinese data service  more than 67 000 companies have registered in China this year to make or trade masks. Many start-ups with poor quality control have already run into trouble. The Chinese government has imposed increasingly stringent customs inspections on exports. “Many mask-manufacturing enterprises — especially the small and medium enterprises that came into the picture much later and do not possess strong foundations — would have to face closure when they have a surplus of masks and profits begin to plunge ” wrote Cai Enze  a retired deputy mayor and economic planner in central China  in an essay in April. “That marks the start of a crisis.” Still  the broader industry in China appears to be better prepared for the future. In Los Angeles  Mr. Tammabattula has found that even producing hand sanitizer is hard. He has been unable to find any company in the United States that still makes plastic bottles with pump handles. He imports them  on expensive chartered aircraft  from China. Mr. Tammabattula has applied for a federal loan for small businesses trying to produce medical supplies  but the paperwork has proved extensive  daunting and slow  he said. “If we were to compare to the Chinese government ” Mr. Tammabattula said  “there’s just no support for domestic manufacturing.” Coral Yang contributed research from Shanghai.

It’s morally right — and in everyone’s self-interest. None Mr. Rubin is a former Treasury secretary. Mr. Miliband is a former British foreign secretary. The coronavirus has hit the poorest the hardest  but until recently  they have mostly been in wealthy countries. Now  even as the pandemic continues to claim lives in high-income countries — and especially the United States — it’s spreading with ferocity in lower- and middle-income countries. The virus has infected at least 1.5 million people in Brazil and claimed more than 60 000 lives there. India ended June with around 600 000 cases  it started the month with just under 200 000. With limited health resources  widespread poverty  large debt burdens and  in some cases  political instability and conflict  developing countries are the new front line in the pandemic. For countries like the United States and Britain  helping the developing world fight the virus and avoid a humanitarian catastrophe is a moral imperative. Those who have benefited from globalization should help pay when it ails. But it is not just cruel to ignore the rest of the world  it’s also against wealthy countries’ self-interest. No country is reliably insulated from a highly contagious virus as long as it persists anywhere. None Developing countries are buyers of exports  sources of raw materials and manufactured components  and destinations for investment. Getting the virus under control in these countries is key to developed economies moving forward on the difficult path to recovery. Moreover  the pandemic has the potential to create social and political disruption and instability. Governments could fall  migration could rise and ungoverned space could expand as the economic effects of the outbreak push tens of millions of people into extreme poverty  create greater competition for limited jobs and exacerbate tensions in already fragile states like Mexico  Nigeria and Pakistan. The cost in aid  loans and security support down the road could far outstrip the costs of tackling the disease now. The starting point of a smart response from wealthy countries like the United States is to support the hand-washing stations  fever testing  isolation centers and public information that are in such short supply in some developing countries. There are alarming holes in the global health infrastructure — epitomized by abysmal levels of coronavirus testing. Though the United States isn’t in control of the disease at home and the Trump administration is breaking away from the World Health Organization  America remains the most important global player when it comes to humanitarian relief. The world desperately needs American leadership — and help. None None None Even if the Trump administration is currently unlikely to support an international effort to distribute drugs  other advanced countries acting together could create the political pressure to bring the United States in. None None of these steps would detract from domestic responses to the pandemic and the economic damage it has caused. But the upside would be significant: reducing the chance of renewed outbreaks in large developed countries  protecting globally connected economies and heading off the pandemic’s potentially disastrous geopolitical and economic consequences. That’s why providing support to developing countries is not only morally right  but also powerfully in the self-interest of richer states. Robert E.

None SEOUL  South Korea — On New Year’s Day  North Korea’s leader  Kim Jong-un  called for a “frontal breakthrough to foil the enemies’ sanctions.” The strategy meant finding new sources of income  legal or illegal  and mainly from China. None But there was one thing Mr. Kim did not foresee: the coronavirus. None China accounted for 95 percent of the North’s trade. Consumer goods  raw materials  fuel and machine parts smuggled into the North across their 870-mile border kept North Korean markets and factories sputtering along  despite United Nations sanctions designed to curb the Kim regime’s nuclear ambitions. None The virus has isolated the North Korean economy as no sanctions could. It has devastated the regime’s ability to bring in money through legal and illegal trade  leaving it scrambling to protect the country’s diminishing foreign currency reserves. “To North Korea  Covid-19 is a black swan  none of its policymakers saw it coming ” said Go Myong-hyun  an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.  None None “If you peel North Korea’s problem like an onion  at the core is its economy  and its economic trouble comes down to whether it can lift sanctions ” said Kim Yong-hyun  a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. The North Korean economy has languished for decades  hobbled by communist mismanagement  a famine in the late 1990s and the gradually tougher sanctions imposed by the United Nations since 2006  when the North carried out its first nuclear test. Mr. Kim has tried to boost the economy with domestic reforms  aimed at creating a “socialist system of responsible business operation.” Factories and collective farms were given more incentives to increase productivity  including the right to keep surpluses. Mr. Kim also ramped up exports of coal  iron ore  textiles and seafood to China  achieving economic growth of 3.9 percent in 2016  the highest since the late 1990s  according to South Korea’s central bank. None The economy shrank by 3.5 percent in 2017. It contracted by 4.1 percent the following year  with its exports to China plummeting 86 percent.  None But Mr. Kim’s hopes of easing the sanctions ended when the Vietnam talks collapsed. None None At the time  Mr. Kim had reason to be so defiant. After hitting bottom in 2018  his country’s trade with China grew 15 percent last year  according to data compiled by the Korea International Trade Association. It exported practically anything not banned by United Nations sanctions: cheap watches assembled with Chinese components  artificial eyelashes  wigs  mannequins  soccer balls and tungsten. None None But the trade imbalance with China created its own concerns. None Since 2017  North Korea has reported a trade deficit of more than $2 billion every year. In comparison  the North’s total exports last year were $260 million.​ None None Mr. Kim’s government also runs shops in Pyongyang  the capital  where the moneyed class spends foreign currency on imported goods. And it has profited by selling Chinese smartphones to an estimated six million cellphone subscribers in the country. “The debate has been about how quickly or slowly the North’s foreign currency would diminish ” Mr. Go said. “But there is no doubt now that Covid-19 has accelerated the speed.” ​Recently  signs have emerged of growing stress on the North’s economy  especially its foreign currency reserves. None None To save on foreign currency  ​Mr. Kim has encouraged his people to produce more goods at home  like snacks  cosmetics and beverages. But Covid-19 has hit those sectors as well  because they depended on Chinese raw materials to produce the goods. “Kim Jong-un thought he could survive with tourism revenues  smuggling and Chinese help ​ but his plans have crumbled because of the coronavirus ” said Mr. Ishimaru​. “If the virus has taught him anything  it is how dependent his economy is on China.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/maine-lobster-summer-virus.html,For Maine Lobstermen  a Perfect Storm Threatens the Summer Season Advertisement Supported by The state’s lobster industry  already struggling before the virus  could be crippled as tourism dries up  leaving boatloads of crustaceans and no one to eat them. None OFF THE COAST OF MAINE — As he pulled alongside one of his lobster pots  marked by a red and yellow buoy on the Penobscot Bay  Mike Hutchings extracted and measured several of the crustaceans that would contribute to his 130-pound catch that day. It was a decent haul but his assessment of the fishing season was grim: “The worst it’s ever been.” Mr. Hutchings’s catch on the final Saturday in June came as the lobster trade approached its money-making time. With the Fourth of July holiday around the corner  Mr. Hutchings and his fellow lobstermen were supposed to be gearing up for a major payday as out-of-staters  cruise ships  warmer weather and bounties of lobsters  having just molted their shells and been lured into the thousands of traps anchored on the rocky bottom of Maine’s coastal waters  came together in a seasonal windfall. But like many businesses across the country  the Maine lobster industry  which makes up the bulk of the fishing revenue the state brings in every year  is being battered by the coronavirus  which has crushed the tourism trade that Mr. Hutchings and his fellow fishermen rely on for a living. With fewer tourists expected to descend in search of lobster rolls  the immediate problem for Mr. Hutchings is simple: too many lobsters and not enough people to eat them. That has sent the price of lobsters plunging. None The effect of the virus on the Maine lobster trade is the latest indication of how the disease is upending nearly all corners of business activity and inflicting economic pain poised to last longer than many had predicted. Last month  after groups of fishermen outlined their concerns for Mr. Trump at an event in Bangor  Maine  the president directed the Agriculture Department to provide federal assistance to lobster harvesters. But that assistance  which has yet to be detailed or allocated  may come too late. More than 30 million people typically visit Maine each year. The majority come in the summer months for the pleasant air of coastal New England  as well as for the lobster  a high-priced specialty that is a staple of tourist meals. None Unlike previous years  this summer will bring no cruise ships and few “no vacancy” signs. The typical rainbow of out-of-state license plates idling in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the bridge to Wiscasset is unlikely to materialize. For Mr. Hutchings  66  whose hands are worn from both line and lobster after fishing Maine waters for more than 50 years  the effect of the pandemic boils down to whether he can make enough money to keep his boat profitable. His expenses include bait  fuel and his crew’s wages. And as the cost of a pound of lobster steadily drops  he has been weighing almost daily whether to leave his harbor in Lincolnville for good. “If the price gets so low  I won’t go ” Mr. Hutchings said  standing as his stern man  Eddie Hustus  quickly moved herring and pogies into mesh bait bags below his boat. “I’m not going to do it for nothing.” In the waning days of June  Mr. Hutchings said he was selling the more costly hard-shell lobsters at around $4.50 a pound  roughly half of what he was able to get for them a year ago. In Lincolnville Harbor  only three of eight boats in the cove had lobster traps in the water  Mr. Hutchings explained. The captains of the others were patiently waiting to see how prices shift. The economic hit to lobstermen seemed a far cry from Mr. Trump’s declaration on social media just a few days earlier. None None After his meeting in Bangor last month  Mr. Trump issued a proclamation directing the agriculture secretary to find ways to assist the lobster industry  which he said had been unfairly targeted with retaliatory tariffs by China. “From 2015 to 2018  American lobster was the most valuable single seafood species harvested in the United States  with Maine accounting for approximately 80 percent of that value each year ” Mr. Trump said in the proclamation  adding that his administration would “mitigate the effects of unfair retaliatory trade practices on this important industry.” Mr. Hutchings  who supports Mr. Trump  called the Bangor event “a photo op ” but said he appreciated the president’s decision to sit down in Maine with the fishing industry  which he believed to be a presidential first  at least in his lifetime. “Whether something good comes out of it  who knows ” Mr. Hutchings said. Mr. Trump’s move to help Maine fishermen is aimed at strengthening his blue-collar bona fides during an election year. Yet for those affected  no number of presidential round tables adorned with lobster traps is likely to change what could be a terrible summer for Maine’s fisheries. “I think there’s obviously a lot of uncertainty for local businesses and a lot of concern for fishermen and for everyone else who relies on tourist business ” said Marianne LaCroix  the executive director of the Maine Lobster Marketing Collaborative. Raymond Young  55  a third-generation lobsterman who grew up putting wood plugs in the claws of crustaceans and owns Young’s Lobster Pound  a Belfast  Maine  staple  has spent the past several years trying to adjust his business as Mr. Trump’s trade policies changed the market. Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs on American lobster nearly crippled exports from wholesalers like Mr. Young. Maine lobster exports to China fell by 48.24 percent in 2019. None Mr. Young’s excess lobsters often go to the Canadian freezer plants at the end of the season  but this year  with low sales and the coronavirus  his buyer’s plants are already full  he said. “Last month we were trading an old dollar for a new one ” Mr. Young said  noting that he did not expect to receive federal aid anytime soon. “If the tourists aren’t here and we can’t ship the other product to Canada because they’re full  it’s going to be a different year as we try and find a home for some of this stuff.” A good season for Mr. Young means roughly 20 boats from a constellation of nearby towns like Searsport  Stockton Springs and Northport are selling their catch to him. So far this year  he has just two boats  leaving a glimmer of hope that fewer vessels on the water will translate to a smaller lobster yield and higher prices. Mr. Hutchings’s 40-foot  Canadian-built  diesel-powered lobster boat  Fundy Spray  is one of those two boats. And on Saturday  Mr. Hutchings said he had decided to put the entirety of his 800 traps in the water this season just in case those prices do turn. Adjusting his camouflage ball cap adorned with “Young’s Lobster Pound” atop his mop of white hair  Mr. Hutchings maneuvered his boat back toward Lincolnville’s harbor. The wind picked up and the sun was out. The deck was covered in seaweed. Several small crabs scurried among the ocean detritus along with the red rubber bands that did not quite make it onto a lobster’s claw. Over the rhythmic churn of his boat’s engine and the occasional chatter from the marine radio  Mr. Hutchings muttered what could easily have been a Maine mantra. “If you’re a fisherman  you have to make it work ” Mr. Hutchings said. “It’s what you do.” Ana Swanson contributed reporting from Washington.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/world/europe/stilton-coronavirus.html,Pandemic Gives S.O.S. a New Meaning for U.K. Cheesemakers: Save Our Stilton Advertisement Supported by With pubs and restaurants closed  the six producers that make the famous blue cheese are fighting for survival. None None But it was when one customer called not to place an order but to return one for a refund that Robert Gosling  the majority shareholder of Hartington Creamery  knew he was in real trouble. “We had to politely say  ‘You can’t really do that ’” Mr. Gosling said  sitting in a farm building in the scenic Derbyshire countryside. For many parts of the British economy  the coronavirus pandemic has been a brutal master  with the closure of nonessential stores and the tourism and hospitality industries  plunging the economy into free-fall. British agriculture has suffered as well. Farmers have had to pour thousands of liters of milk down the drain  and food companies have struggled to use mountains of unwanted beef and potatoes that had been destined for restaurants or fast food outlets. Markets for most of those products have stabilized  but many makers of specialty products are still suffering. Stilton is particularly vulnerable: Just half a dozen companies make the distinctive  crumbly  blue cheese  and the pandemic has pushed some of them close to the edge. With sales down almost a third on average — Hartington suffered an 80 percent drop — producers are asking Britons to save Stilton by choosing it over continental cheeses  and using it in new recipes or to top burgers. “We have appealed to the British public to be patriotic and to buy their British blue cheese ” said Kim Kettle  who represents Long Clawson Dairy  a farming cooperative  at the Stilton Cheesemakers’ Association. In particular  the current troubles could deter the next generation from continuing the tradition of cheesemaking  he said. This being Britain  there is a rich and quirky history behind the emergence of Stilton  one of the country’s most famous food products and one that enjoys special protected status. By law  those entitled to use the name for their cheese must work from one of three English counties — Derbyshire  Leicestershire or Nottinghamshire. The area excludes the village of Stilton  after which the cheese is named  because it lies a little to the southeast  in Cambridgeshire. None None But for those with the legal right to make Stilton the climate was tough even before the pandemic hit. Not only has the cheese had to jostle on supermarket shelves with continental varieties  the United States slapped a 25 percent tariff on imports of Stilton last year in the latest chapter of an interminable trade dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers. Nowhere are the stakes higher than at Hartington  a small producer that does not have the scale to fill big export orders or supply the large supermarkets that stayed open during the pandemic. Instead  it relies principally on the local hospitality trade  which shut down. Commercial cheese production began in this part of Derbyshire around 1875  though it was not until 1900 that Stilton was made here for the first time. That operation ultimately closed in 2009 but the Hartington creamery began producing Stilton in Pikehall in 2012  making around 120 tons of cheese a year. Inside a farm building on this compact site lie two long vats  the larger of which holds 4 500 liters  or nearly 1 200 gallons  of a pasteurized milk whose liquids and solids slowly separate at a carefully controlled temperature. But it is in the part of the creamery where dozens of cheeses mature that the impact of the pandemic becomes obvious. Here  where the smell is so strong that it stings the eyes  some of the large round cheeses that should have been eaten in April have ripened  sagged and collapsed to half their normal size — a loss of sales that could cost the company as much as 15 000 pounds  about $19 000. “I am 65 this year and I have never seen this before — you can’t plan for this ” said Alan Salt  a shareholder in Hartington who helped set up the new creamery and works there several days a week. “We are lucky we are still going  it’s as simple as that ” Mr. Salt said as he bored a small hole in the side of a cheese to extract a sample to test for taste and texture. The creamery also makes several other cheeses  including Peakland White  a crumbly  salty white cheese  and Dovedale Blue  a soft cheese that is “like Stilton and Brie having a love child ” as Mr. Salt put it. The pandemic has forced Hartington to adapt to survive. By lowering temperatures  it has extended the manufacturing process somewhat and switched to making more dairy products that last longer. But matured Stilton  which has a shelf life of around 42 days  will rot if left unsold — as some of it was when lockdown began abruptly. Nor is it easy to plan for the future. No one knows exactly when the hospitality sector will reopen  perhaps next month  nor how quickly demand will return once it does. So  instead of selling large eight-kilo cheeses to wholesalers for use in pubs and restaurants  Hartington is now dividing them into smaller portions that it has been selling online or to small distributors. “It has been a shock to the system ” said Diana Alcock  a director of the company  who described working at the creamery as being part of a family. “It’s been quite stressful.” The company has been helped by a £10 000 property tax break from the government and a £50 000 loan through a program designed to help businesses weather the pandemic. But that injection of £60 000 was needed to save the business. Mr. Gosling said that while things have been tough — and sometimes demoralizing — he is confident the firm will survive. “You find out who the real friends of Hartington Creamery are in times of need ” he said  adding that there seemed to be enough. “These guys here make cheese lovingly and with their own hands  there’s an art and a magic too it  and a bit of mystery too ” Mr. Gosling said. “It isn’t like making ball bearings in a factory.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/business/economy/usmca-takes-effect.html,As New NAFTA Takes Effect  Much Remains Undone Advertisement Supported by The beginning of a new trade deal does not signal an end to trade disputes between United States  Canada and Mexico. None None Company executives  government officials and union leaders around the continent have been scrambling to comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement  which overhauls a trade deal that has governed commerce among the three countries for more than 26 years. None But many of the deal’s requirements  like expanding worker rights or opening up the flow of agriculture  have not been fully met  or still need to be phased in over the coming months and years. Industries as varied as automobiles and agriculture are still struggling to understand recent guidelines from the U.S. government and certify that their products satisfy the trade deal  which requires some industries to buy more materials and components from North America and provide the government detailed information on their sourcing and wages. None Michael Wessel  the staff chairman of the Labor Advisory Committee that counsels the administration on trade issues  said that while much public attention had focused on the drama of negotiating the U.S.M.C.A.  “the really hard work of making the provisions effective  ensuring that workers’ rights are advanced and that the competitive landscape changes is ahead of us.” “Making sure we don’t lose sight  and action  on the changes that need to be implemented  monitored and enforced will be a day-by-day fight ” Mr. Wessel added. None The Trump administration has taken an aggressive approach to rewriting and enforcing trade rules. The U.S.M.C.A.  a comprehensive deal that covers the country’s most important trading partners  is the biggest test so far of Mr. Trump’s ability to change global trade terms in America’s favor. Administration officials say they are gearing up to use the new deal as a way to challenge Canadian and Mexican business practices that harm American interests. None None That included sweeping changes to Mexico’s labor system  which would try to break the corrupt unions that help many companies control their workers in Mexico  and replace them with freely organized unions that could negotiate better wages and working conditions. That in turn would benefit American workers  by giving them a more level playing field to compete. Mr. Lighthizer pointed to Mexico’s refusal to accept American biotech products — like genetically modified corn and other crops — as one area where the United States could bring a case under the new trade deal. Mexico’s labor reforms and treatment of American media companies are also garnering U.S. scrutiny. Mr. Lighthizer told lawmakers that his agency would take action “early and often” to combat violations of the agreement’s labor rules  which are meant to improve wages and working conditions  particularly in Mexico. None Another new part of U.S.M.C.A. that was crucial for winning the support of Democrats and labor leaders was its “enforcement provisions ” which give governments  unions and workers the ability to report violations of the agreement  and to try to seek redress. One of these systems allows the countries to bring cases against one another about labor rights or a wide variety of other issues. Another fast-acting  labor-specific system allows unions  workers and other parties to report labor violations  which may lead to factory inspections and even products from the offending company being blocked at the U.S. border. “We’ve always talked about agreements that don’t have teeth  and this one has some teeth ” said Ben Davis  the director of international affairs for the United Steelworkers union. “Maybe not a full mouthful  maybe not as sharp as we need it  but it has some teeth  and we’re all waiting to see how that plays out.” Mr. Lighthizer has said that these provisions will help to reverse a long-running trend  where manufacturers have moved out of the United States to take advantage of lower wages and laxer working conditions in Mexico. “It wasn’t economics in my judgment  it was industrial policy down there ” Mr. Lighthizer said in the June 17 hearing  about companies outsourcing to Mexico. “We’ve turned that around.” Congressional Democrats and labor leaders say it’s too early for the Trump administration to declare victory  pointing to Mexico’s half-finished labor reforms. At that hearing  Richard E. Neal  a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts  said there had been “serious deficiencies” in how Mexico was enacting its labor reforms. “We’re going to hold people’s feet to the fire ” said Representative Rosa DeLauro  Democrat of Connecticut and one of the Democratic negotiators. Mexico passed a sweeping labor law in 2019 aimed at meeting the pledges it had made to Canada and the United States in its new trade deal by giving workers more ability to organize and bargain. But since the labor law was passed  violence against Mexican labor activists has continued  and hundreds of lawsuits have been filed challenging the constitutionality of these reforms. If the Mexican Supreme Court rules that the labor law is unconstitutional  Mexico could be in violation of a major portion of the trade pact  and could face tariffs or other punitive actions from the United States and Canada. Union leaders are preparing a list of labor cases they could bring under the new agreement’s dispute settlement provisions  including that of a Mexican labor lawyer  Susana Prieto Terrazas  who was arrested while trying to establish an independent union. But it remains to be seen what kind of punishment the independent panels that review these cases could hand down  if any. “Implementation is only as good as they’re willing to enforce it ” said Representative Jimmy Gomez  Democrat of California. “We’re going to be paying attention  very closely  to how the agreement is implemented.” “The promise of the U.S.M.C.A. is that it was righting the wrongs of NAFTA ” he added. “But if they’re not willing to use it  or if they’re taking steps to undermine it  then it’s for naught.” For companies that are scrambling to comply with the trade pact’s voluminous rules for how they source their products and share information with the government  much remains uncertain as well. None “It’s absolutely a scramble ” Mr. Mojica said. Ann Wilson  the senior vice president for government affairs at the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association  which represents auto parts suppliers  said companies were facing significant costs to meet the new rules at a particularly trying time  in the midst of a pandemic and economic recession. “Many of these companies are still laying off people  furloughing people  and they’re still trying to grapple with these requirements ” Ms. Wilson said. But companies will have a grace period to adapt to the new regulations. U.S. Customs and Border Protection  which monitors imports at American ports  has already indicated that  for the next six months  it will focus on helping companies to meet the rules  rather than punishing them if they unwittingly break them. “I think both parties are going to be learning for a while ” Mr. Mojica said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/world/europe/johnson-brexit-hong-kong.html,Boris Johnson’s ‘Global Britain’: Inspired Vision or Wishful Thinking? Advertisement Supported by Post-Brexit Britain is going it alone at a time when globalization is in retreat. But a clash with China over Hong Kong has shown the limits of what it can do. None LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his pro-Brexit allies have long promised that once Britain broke free of the European Union  it could play a bold new role on the world stage — one they dubbed Global Britain. For a few days this week  it looked as if they were actually making good on that promise. When China imposed a new security law on Hong Kong  Mr. Johnson not only condemned the Chinese government  he also threw open Britain’s doors to nearly three million residents of the former British colony who were eligible for residency in Britain. It was a strong  some even said brave  stand by a long-departed colonial government against the oppression of a rising superpower. None “We’re a medium-size power that needs to work with others to secure what we want around the world ” said Chris Patten  who served as the last British governor of Hong Kong. Leaving the European Union  he said  had deprived Britain of its most natural partner “in trying to deal with these global issues.” The clash with China laid bare deeper contradictions in Mr. Johnson’s post-Brexit vision: Britain wants to go global at a time when globalization is in retreat. It has cast off from the world’s largest trading bloc when the world is more divided than ever into competing regions. And it is trying to carve out an overseas role just as the coronavirus pandemic has crippled its domestic economy. Mr. Johnson’s model is no longer Winston Churchill  the proud symbol of Britain’s imperial reach  but Franklin D. Roosevelt  whose New Deal put American society back on its feet after the Great Depression. None Moreover  the geopolitical landscape has shifted significantly since the Brexit referendum — and even more rapidly since the pandemic spread around the world. With rivalry and antagonism between China and the West on the rise  Britain as a free agent will be caught uncomfortably in between  constantly forced to choose sides in a postpandemic world. “One consequence of a postglobalization world is that people will start to think in a defensive way about blocs ” said Mark Malloch Brown  a former deputy secretary general of the United Nations. “Britain is adrift without a bloc. That is going to be challenging  and a first example of this is Hong Kong.” British diplomats showed skill in lining up the United States  Canada and Australia to sign a stern letter to the Chinese government about the new law. But in defending the rights of those who hold British overseas passports  Britain is on its own. Neither the European Union  so recently forsaken by Britain  nor the United States  largely indifferent to human rights under President Trump  is eager to join that fight. Mr. Johnson once cast Britain’s independence as a competitive advantage. He said it would allow the country to pursue trade agreements with China  the United States or anyone else  unencumbered by the European Union. None But as relations between China and the United States have soured  Mr. Johnson is caught in the middle. After initially fending off pressure from Mr. Trump to keep the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei out of Britain’s 5G digital network  Mr. Johnson has been forced to reconsider. Some analysts say they expect him to reverse himself and impose additional restrictions on Huawei. Part of the reason is technical: American sanctions on Huawei have raised the security risks of allowing the company to build a large part of the network. But part of it is geopolitical reality. In any coming Cold War between the United States and China  Britain cannot afford to alienate its most important ally. “The danger is finding ourselves trapped between President Trump and President Xi ” Mr. Patten said  referring to the Chinese leader  Xi Jinping. Mr. Trump’s faltering political fortunes pose another risk to Mr. Johnson. The president has enthusiastically supported Brexit and embraced the prime minister as a like-minded populist. If Mr. Trump were to lose in November  Mr. Johnson would face an uncertain new counterpart in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. There is nothing to suggest that Mr. Biden would not champion the alliance with Britain. On some issues  like Iran and climate change  there would be fewer points of friction. But Mr. Biden is not likely to attach the same priority to a trade deal that Mr. Trump has. Former President Barack Obama famously warned Britons they would be at the “back of the queue” for trade talks if they voted for Brexit. Mr. Biden is also a devoted Irish-American who would look out for Ireland’s interests  as Britain negotiates its long-term trade relationship with the European Union (a breakthrough in those talks seems more elusive than ever). The preservation of the Good Friday Agreement  which ended years of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland  is an article of faith among Democrats. “Democrats are bewildered by the logic of Brexit  to begin with ” Mr. Malloch Brown said. “There is a very strong Democratic Irish lobby  which will be really watching like a hawk that this doesn’t put Ireland at a disadvantage.” To some critics  Global Britain was never more than a marketing slogan. After all  they said  Britain has for centuries seen itself as a global player  one that punched above its weight economically and militarily  long after the end of the empire and throughout its 47 years of membership in Europe’s institutions. Today  in any event  powerful Johnson advisers  like Dominic Cummings  are more concerned about transforming British society than asserting its influence abroad. They know the Conservative Party won its 80-seat Parliamentary majority with the votes of working-class people in Britain’s Midlands and north  who care more about saving their jobs than striking trade deals. Since Mr. Johnson’s victory  he has used the Global Britain label mainly to put a gloss on a bureaucratic decision: merging two government ministries  the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. The rationale  he said  is to align Britain’s foreign aid with its strategic and commercial interests. Some former diplomats said Mr. Johnson should not stop there. “If you really want a Global Britain  and you want the Foreign Office to have genuine policy heft  then bring in the trade department ” said Simon Fraser  who once headed the Foreign Office. There are grounds for hope about Britain’s role. Its diplomats are pushing a proposal to expand the Group of 7 to include three other big democracies  South Korea  India and Australia. Other countries have welcomed it as an alternative to Mr. Trump’s much-maligned plan to invite Russia back into the club. Britain remains a substantial military power  with nuclear weapons and a close intelligence relationship with the United States and other allies — known as the Five Eyes — that analysts say has recovered since the strains over Huawei. None None If the pandemic finally punctures the illusion of a Global Britain  Britain can take solace in what has not changed. It remains a midsize country  anchored in the West  deeply intertwined with Europe and inescapably lashed to the United States. “It has made them realize that they couldn’t have their cake and eat it too ” said Thomas Wright  director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. “That is a delusion that has now been stripped away. They’ve been forced back into their more traditional space.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/arts/design/facebook-looting-artifacts-ban.html,Facebook  Citing Looting Concerns  Bans Historical Artifact Sales Advertisement Supported by The company announced the prohibition after researchers reported that looters were using the platform to identify and sell illegally excavated antiquities. None None The decision came after archaeologists and activists who monitor the illicit antiquities trade said they had identified at least 200 Facebook groups with nearly two million members that were using the platform to find black market buyers and to offer tutorials on how best to dig up and deliver the most sought-after items. Common examples include burial relics  stone sculptures  mosaics and in some instances entire sarcophagi from Syria  Egypt  Iraq and North Africa. None The Facebook policy defines historical artifacts as “rare items of significant historical  cultural or scientific value” that include ancient funerary items  coins  tombstones  engraved seals  scrolls and manuscripts. In many cases  according to video footage obtained by the Antiquities Trafficking and Heritage Anthropology Research Project  an investigative study project led by antiquities experts  the middlemen running the Facebook groups give real-time instructions to looters on which items to excavate and steal. Katie Paul  co-director of the project  said in an interview: “They literally will post pictures from auction catalogs and say  ‘See  this is how much this stuff can sell for  so go for it guys.’” Online traffickers  she added  will also try to reassure illicit buyers that they are getting genuine items by posting photos or videos showing the objects being unearthed in situ. Ms. Paul said buyers and sellers will use coded language to discuss the antiquities  then move to an encrypted app where they can complete the deal.

None Ms. Paul said Facebook had been slow to admit the problem and lax in policing criminal activity online. “For years  Facebook has served as a massive outlet for antiquities looters and traffickers as they seek to feed material into a widening global network ” she said. But she said the recent decision by Facebook “represents an important shift in their position on the trade in cultural heritage and demonstrates that they recognize that this is an illegal and harmful activity that is occurring on their platform.” She added  however  that “a policy is only as good as its enforcement.” Mr. Azm said he wants Facebook to preserve all evidence of trafficking rather than simply delete it. “The photos and videos of artifacts we see posted on Facebook  often while still in the ground  may be the only evidence of that object’s existence ” Mr. Azm said.

None None None None In separate statements on Monday  the State Department said that it would end exports of U.S. military equipment to Hong Kong  while the Commerce Department said that Hong Kong would now be subject to the same types of controls on certain technology exports that apply to China. Those controls block American companies from selling certain types of sensitive  high-technology products that could threaten national security to China  Russia and other countries deemed to be a security risk. The effect of the new restrictions announced Monday appears to be relatively limited in scope  given the small volume of trade the United States does with Hong Kong. Hong Kong represented just 2.2 percent of American exports in 2018  with defense and high-technology items making up a sliver of that. But the export limitations announced Monday could have larger implications for some multinational companies  including some semiconductor firms  who now will be barred from sending products or sharing certain high-tech information with the territory. Some multinational companies that chose Hong Kong as a base for doing business with China have begun considering moves to other locations  including Singapore. Zhao Lijian  a foreign ministry spokesman  on Tuesday criticized the American response to the Hong Kong security legislation. “The U.S. wants to use the so-called sanctions to obstruct China’s legislative process  to safeguard national security in Hong Kong — such an attempt stands no chance of success ” he said. “Regarding the wrong moves by the U.S. side  China will take necessary retaliatory measures to resolutely safeguard our national interests.” None None In a statement  Wilbur Ross  the commerce secretary  said that China’s new security law undermined the territory’s autonomy and increased the risk that delicate American technology would be diverted to China’s military or security forces. Mr. Ross said that further actions to eliminate Hong Kong’s differential treatment were “also being evaluated.” “We urge Beijing to immediately reverse course and fulfill the promises it has made to the people of Hong Kong and the world ” he added. “It gives us no pleasure to take this action ” Mike Pompeo  the secretary of state  said in a separate statement. “But given Beijing now treats Hong Kong as ‘One Country  One System ’ so must we.” Halting American high-tech exports to Hong Kong is not a new idea  as some American security experts have warned for years that China may be using purchases through Hong Kong to obtain products of military value that are prohibited for sale directly to mainland China. But Edward Yau  Hong Kong’s secretary of commerce and economic development  said in an interview in his office in Hong Kong last year that the city has very tight controls on any re-export of high-tech gear that is subject to export controls by the United States or any other country. Mr. Yau said at the time that the Hong Kong government was strongly opposed to any American move to apply export controls to Hong Kong  saying that Hong Kong retains a separate system in many ways from the mainland and has a history of close cooperation with the United States.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/business/coronavirus-for-profit-colleges.html,For-Profit Colleges  Long Troubled  See Surge Amid Pandemic None The coronavirus shutdowns have made online learning more attractive. But students at some schools say they have been taken advantage of. None Supported by None In March  as colleges and universities shuttered campuses under a nationwide lockdown  Strayer University updated its website with a simple message: “Great things can happen at home.” Capella University  owned by the same company as Strayer  has run ads promoting its flexibility in “uncertain times” and promising would-be transfer students that they can earn a bachelor’s degree in as little as a year. Online for-profit colleges like these have seen an opportunity to increase enrollment during the coronavirus pandemic. Their flexible programs may be newly attractive to the many workers who have lost their jobs  to college students whose campuses are closed  and to those now seeking to change careers. The colleges’ parent companies often have substantial cash reserves that they can pump into tuition discounts and marketing at a time when public universities and nonprofit colleges are seeing their budgets disintegrate. Few of the largest for-profit colleges operating primarily online have track records to justify the optimistic advertising pitches. Some have put students deep in debt while posting dismal graduation rates amid a history of investigations by state and federal agencies  including many that have led to substantial financial settlements. Still  there is evidence that interest in the schools has increased. “I hate to call anybody a winner in this crisis ” said Jeffrey M. Silber  managing director at BMO Capital Markets  a financial services company  “but I think growth will increase this fall and could continue thereafter.” For-profit colleges have long devoted large sums to advertising  spending almost $400 per student in 2017  according to research from the Brookings Institution. For nonprofit institutions  that figure was $48  and for public colleges it was $14. “Unfortunately  because of the financial distress a lot of not-for-profits are facing  they may have to cut back on marketing ” Mr. Silber said. “I think the for-profits may be at a competitive advantage.” Ashford University has received so many new inquiries in recent months that it has announced plans to hire 200 additional “enrollment advisers” to field them. Another school that operates largely online  Grand Canyon University  says it has had a surge in enrollments. (Grand Canyon has nonprofit status in Arizona and with the Internal Revenue Service but is designated as a for-profit institution by the U.S. Department of Education.) Capella and Strayer have reported increases in requests for information. The trend concerns many student-protection advocacy groups  which point out that the colleges that stand to gain are among those with the most troubling records. For the most part  the largest online for-profit universities have poor graduation rates — often no higher than 25 percent  and sometimes as low as in the single digits. Several have been accused of intentionally misleading students about potential job prospects to persuade them to enroll and often to take on tens of thousands of dollars in debt. Eileen Connor  the legal director at the Project on Predatory Student Lending at Harvard Law School  said she was worried by the prospect of a resurgence for online  for-profit schools. “In times of economic downturn  that’s when the for-profit colleges start to thrive ” she said. Online colleges “have a running start  especially now  when there’s an economic downturn keeping people in their homes ” she added. “That is a perfect storm for the thing that they’re trying to do.” These schools often attract low-income  nontraditional college students who tend to have lower completion rates than those who enroll straight from high school and attend full time. Many have family pressures that interfere with study. In recent earnings calls  many companies emphasized the quality of the education they provide. Karl McDonnell  the chief executive of Strategic Education Inc.  the parent company of Capella and Strayer  told investors in March  “We’re going to continue to focus on maintaining the highest possible academic quality figuring that that’s really the best way to sort of position yourself vis-à-vis any kinds of regulatory or legislative initiatives.” In the first quarter  Strategic Education took in $46.5 million in profit  up from $36.7 million over the same quarter last year. Its executive chairman  Robert Silberman  told investors that the company had a “fortress balance sheet with over $500 million in cash.” Before the broad market decline last week  Strategic’s stock price had climbed steadily since early April  as had those of other publicly traded companies that own universities and college-related education services  including Grand Canyon Education Inc.  Perdoceo Education Corporation and Zovio. But for many of their students  the future is precarious. At Capella  only 11 percent of undergraduates earn a degree within eight years  according to the most recent federal statistics. At Strayer  graduation rates range from 3 percent at its Arkansas campus to a high of 27 percent in Virginia. Fewer than a third of students at Perdoceo campuses graduate within eight years. The company’s schools were recently barred from receiving G.I. Bill money from new students after the Department of Veterans Affairs found that they had used sales and enrollment practices that were “erroneous  deceptive or misleading.” Ashford University  owned by Zovio  had a 25 percent graduation rate  according to the most recent federal data. Those completing degrees had a median debt of $34 000 on leaving. Zovio is being sued by the California attorney general  accused of making false promises to students and using illegal debt collection practices. The company denies any wrongdoing. For-profit schools made a similar play for students during the 2008 recession  as people searching for work in a shrinking job market sought new credentials at low cost. Enrollment at for-profit colleges climbed 24 percent at the height of the recession  according to an analysis by BMO Capital Markets. Along with that surge came increased scrutiny. Government investigators concluded that two of the biggest for-profit operators  Corinthian Colleges Inc. and ITT Technical Institute  had mismanaged or failed to account for millions of dollars in federal financial aid. They were subsequently barred from receiving such aid  which led to their collapse. The companies were also accused of pushing students to take loans they could never expect to repay. The Obama administration put rules in place to shut down programs whose graduates didn’t earn enough to pay back their student debt and to make it easier for students who had been defrauded to have their loans forgiven. Experts say conditions are ripe for new growth in the for-profit sector because the Trump administration has rolled back those changes. “A lot of the pieces are in place to be right back where we were in 2008  and the regulations that had come out of lessons learned are being whittled away ” said Yan Cao  a fellow at the liberal-leaning Century Foundation who studies higher education. The Trump administration’s Department of Education has disputed criticism of its oversight of for-profit colleges. It notes that it has expanded information on its websites to help students make informed choices. Shawn Cooper  an Air Force veteran  said he was twice given approval for his dissertation project at Capella and worked on it for months  only to be told that he needed to start over with a new topic. He said he was forced to leave  despite a 4.0 grade-point average. Mr. Cooper says he owes more than $100 000 in student loans after his time at Capella. “At the end of the day  I feel like it’s all just a facade on their end ” he said. “Get people in  take their money and get them out  usually without anything to show for it.” Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent  after it hit 14.7 percent in April  which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None A lawsuit was filed against Capella seeking class-action status for students like Mr. Cooper who say the school intentionally and needlessly prolonged their doctoral programs  costing them tens of thousands of dollars. Last year  a judge allowed three counts in the suit to continue  all regarding the time it took a “typical” student to complete programs  but dismissed most other counts  including those about how long the programs were “designed” or “structured” to take. Strategic Education officials did not reply to requests for comment. Angela Selden  the chief executive of American Public Education Inc.  which owns American Public University and American Military University  told investors that the company has started spending part of its marketing budget originally earmarked for later this year. “The pandemic has created an unexpected opportunity ” Ms. Selden said. Wallace Boston  the president of American Public’s two universities  said both schools offered a high-quality education. “People who are critical of the sector on a whole tend to be looking at things on the surface  and marketing is one of the things they pick on the most ” Mr. Boston said. “I don’t think that those critics are justified unless they do their homework.” Relative to some other online-only institutions  the American Public University System is cheaper  at $6 880 a year in tuition and fees  and has higher graduation rates. Still  22 percent of American Public University’s 36 000-plus students graduate after eight years  according to the most recent federal data. Mr. Boston said the university allowed students to take up to a decade to complete their programs. The most recent 10-year graduation rate was 35 percent  he added. Tyler Hutchinson  of Brigham City  Utah  enrolled at American Public University in 2017. He had three children and worked part time  so the flexibility of taking online classes offered hope a degree in environmental science that would lead to a well-paying job. But Mr. Hutchinson  31  dropped out after one semester because  he said  the college did not disburse his federal financial aid. The school also sent him a bill for more than $1 000 for classes the next semester that he had never signed up for  he said — a bill that has been sold to a collection agency. Mr. Boston said the university could not provide information about a student without the student’s consent. Mr. Hutchinson gave his consent by email  but a spokesman said the university needed a formal consent filing and would have no further comment. Having been laid off at a convenience store and with his work as a United States Census worker suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic  Mr. Hutchinson has no income. “When they advertised  what got me was the work-life balance. And with financial aid  it was really attractive ” he said. “Even though I really enjoyed it  the financials were such a burden we just decided to discontinue.” American Public Education Inc.’s net income of $2.4 million in the first three months of 2020 was more than double that of the same period last year  and on June 9 its stock price hit its highest closing point in a year.

None WASHINGTON — The House tried and failed on Friday to invalidate stringent rules imposed by the Trump administration on student loan forgiveness  falling short of overriding a veto by President Trump. The override effort  which would have revived bipartisan legislation to overturn regulations put in place last year by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos  failed by a vote of 238 to 173  lacking the two-thirds majority it would have needed to pass. Six Republicans joined every Democrat in voting to defy Mr. Trump’s position. “It was important to try ” said Representative Susie Lee  Democrat of Nevada  who led the effort. “You have 350 000 students in this country who are waiting for relief. “They can’t get on with their lives ” she added. “This is a rule that’s clearly stacked in favor of predatory schools and against students.” The new rules  which make it much more difficult for students who say their schools defrauded them to have their loans forgiven  are now set to take effect July 1. None Ms. DeVos’s move was met with backlash from veterans’ organizations who argued that it would harm former service members who had been bilked by unscrupulous for-profit colleges. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California called the new rules “an act of staggering cruelty.” Those sentiments were echoed on the House floor on Friday during debate. “The American people do not support Betsy DeVos ” said Representative Pramila Jayapal  Democrat of Washington  who argued the secretary was seeking to reward “predatory for-profit colleges” at students’ expense. “The people’s House stands on the side of the people  and not Betsy DeVos.” Representative Alma Adams  Democrat of North Carolina  took particular issue with arguments from the Trump administration that the rule protects historically black colleges and universities. “No H.B.C.U. has ever been implicated ” Ms. Adams said. “That’s fake news.” Republicans  however  argued the new rules shielded colleges from students who run up debts they simply did not wish to pay. “The Obama administration used this process to advance an ideological loan-forgiveness scheme ” argued Representative Lloyd K. Smucker  Republican of Pennsylvania. Representative Steve Watkins Jr.  Republican of Kansas  called the Obama-era regulations “costly” and said they led to “abuse.” At issue is a little-known loan forgiveness rule  called “borrower defense to repayment ” that was the main vehicle the Obama administration used to grant debt relief to tens of thousands of students affected by the collapse of two large for-profit college chains  Corinthian Colleges and ITT Tech  in 2015 and 2016. None Ms. DeVos’s changes raised the bar for borrower relief claims  requiring each applicant to individually prove that a school knowingly misled them  and that he or she was financially harmed by the deception. They also set a three-year deadline on claims. The department said the new rules would save taxpayers about $11 billion over the next decade. “That’s $11 billion that students who have been defrauded will now have to pay ” said Representative Robert C. Scott  Democrat of Virginia. Outraged by the changes  several groups  led by Veterans Education Success  began running advertisements on Fox News hoping to persuade Mr. Trump to reconsider. They argued the new rules did not protect military service members who had long been the targets of predatory tactics by colleges because of their lucrative G.I. benefits. Ultimately  Mr. Trump sided with Ms. DeVos in arguing the Obama-era regulations were too broad in defining what amounted to educational fraud. Despite the loss  Ms. Lee said she planned to revisit the issue soon. “I will not give up the fight on this ” she said. “I’ve actually spent a large part of the past several days calling my Republican colleagues  trying to find another path forward.” Erica L.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/politics/devos-trump-student-loan-rules.html,Over Veterans’ Protests  Trump Vetoes Measure to Block Student Loan Rules Advertisement Supported by President Trump sided with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos over veterans’ groups  vetoing a measure that would have blocked new regulations that tighten access to student loan forgiveness. None WASHINGTON — President Trump vetoed a bipartisan resolution on Friday to overturn new regulations that significantly tighten access to federal student loan forgiveness  siding with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos over veterans’ organizations that say her rules will harm veterans bilked by unscrupulous for-profit colleges. None None None “President Trump’s veto of my bipartisan bill to help our veterans was a victory for Education Secretary DeVos and the fraud merchants at the for-profit colleges ” said Senator Richard J. Durbin  Democrat of Illinois  who sponsored the resolution in the Senate. “My question to the president: In four days  did you forget those flag-waving Memorial Day speeches as you vetoed a bill the veterans were begging for?” Several groups  led by Veterans Education Success  began running advertisements on Fox News programs urging Mr. Trump to sign the resolution  which Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent to the White House last week. In a statement  Ms. Pelosi called the rule “an act of staggering cruelty.” She said the House would soon vote to overturn the veto  but rounding up two-thirds of the House and Senate would be almost impossible. “The House and Senate  on a bipartisan basis  firmly stood with our students and veterans to reject the administration’s cruel and dangerous decision ” Ms. Pelosi said. “It is sad that the president rejected the will of the Congress and the country with his veto.” The news of the veto left groups despondent. Only hours beforehand  the American Legion  a nonpartisan group that represents two million members  pleaded with the president to sign the resolution  saying that Ms. DeVos’s rule would make it “nearly impossible” for cheated veterans to use it. Ms. DeVos’s changes raised the bar for borrower relief claims  requiring applicants to individually prove that a school knowingly misled them and  even if students were bilked  that they were financially harmed by the deception. They also set a three-year deadline on claims. None Representative Susie Lee  Democrat of Nevada  who sponsored the resolution in the House  said that “the fight for our students and veterans is far from over.” “It’s clear the 2019 rule will weaken both protections for students and oversight of shady schools  while forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for the fraudulent actions of a few bad actors ” she said. The little-known loan forgiveness rule  called “borrower defense to repayment” was the main vehicle the Obama administration used to grant debt relief to tens of thousands of students affected by the collapse of two large for-profit college chains  Corinthian Colleges and ITT Tech  in 2015 and 2016. None The Education Department’s inspector general also found that the Obama administration had a flimsy infrastructure for processing claims  though its review did not find any errors in granting debt relief. Ms. DeVos has faced fierce criticism and lawsuits over how she had tried to overhaul the claims process  and the department amassed a backlog of applications while she wrote the new rule  which was finished in September. The department said the new rule would save taxpayers about $11 billion over the next decade. “This administration is committed to protecting all student from fraud and holding all schools accountable when they fail their students ” said Angela L. Morabito  a spokeswoman for the department. “This administration’s rule does just that  despite false claims from many corners. The secretary is thankful to the president for his leadership on this issue.” Emily Cochrane contributed reporting. Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/us/politics/trump-betsy-devos-student-debt-forgiveness.html,Trump’s Dilemma: Reject DeVos Debt Forgiveness Rollback or Anger Veterans Advertisement Supported by Nancy Pelosi sent the president a bipartisan resolution to reverse his education secretary’s tightening of student debt forgiveness rules. He must decide whether to sign it during an economic crisis. None WASHINGTON — Amid mounting coronavirus deaths  a faltering economy and slipping poll numbers  President Trump faces a fresh dilemma with possible consequences for his re-election: Should he stand by his education secretary’s efforts to roll back loan forgiveness for students bilked by their colleges? On Tuesday  Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent Mr. Trump Congress’s bipartisan resolution to overturn an Education Department rule that would make it considerably harder for students to have their federal loans forgiven  even if they could show they were victims of unscrupulous universities. If the president signs it  he will hand Education Secretary Betsy DeVos a humiliating defeat  the first reversal of a major Trump administration regulation. If he vetoes it  he stands to enrage veterans groups that have come out strongly against Ms. DeVos’s loan-forgiveness policy — and whose favor he has long courted. “I’m truly proud to be a veteran today ” said Tasha Berkhalter of Lima  Ohio  a veteran whose degree from a for-profit college proved worthless after it suddenly went bankrupt. “I hope President Trump shows people that after service  we still matter.” None The Senate gave final passage to the measure overturning the rule in March  though the coronavirus quarantine delayed Ms. Pelosi from sending it to the president. None None None None None None The little-known loan forgiveness rule gained recognition when the Obama administration used it to extend debt relief to tens of thousands of students affected by the implosion of two large for-profit college chains  Corinthian Colleges and ITT Tech  in 2015 and 2016. The Education Department determined that both chains had used deceptive recruiting tactics and that many of their former students should have their debts eliminated. Veterans have long been considered among the groups most vulnerable to predatory recruitment tactics because of their lucrative G.I. Bill benefits. The benefits are particularly attractive to for-profit schools  because federal law requires those schools to obtain at least 10 percent of their revenue from sources other than Education Department-backed student loans. G.I. Bill benefits help schools meet that quota. Ms. DeVos said that the Obama-era rules amounted to “free money ” and that the previous administration lacked the infrastructure to process claims in a way that was fair to students  schools and taxpayers. Her changes raised the bar for borrower relief claims  requiring applicants to individually prove that a school knowingly misled them and  even if students were bilked  that they were financially harmed by the deception. They also set a three-year deadline on claims. The effort to repeal the rule drew even nonpartisan groups like the American Legion  which represents two million members  into the fight. None “This type of deception against our veterans and service members has been a lucrative scam for unscrupulous actors ” he wrote. In the minutes after the Senate took its vote  Ms. Berkhalter did what she has done often in the last decade when discussing her student loans: She wept. Ms. Berkhalter served in the Army as a motor transportation specialist for five years before she was honorably discharged for medical reasons in 2005. The same desire to “try to make things right  and put away the bad guys” that led her to the military also made her jump at the opportunity to attend ITT Technical Institute in 2006 to study criminal justice. But well before she graduated in 2010  she had unanswered questions about ITT’s promised but nonexistent “high tech” equipment and outdated books. An admissions officer at another school warned her that her credits would not transfer. ITT officials asked her to take out loans to front the cost of her tuition while they “waited” for her G.I. Bill check  then requested she take out even more loans to cover inexplicably rising costs. “They were very convincing. I was too trusting. I just wanted to go to school ” she said. After graduation  her dream job was so close she could see it. She was on a tour of a mental health treatment center for criminals where she was interviewing for a new job as a case manager  and her would-be bosses showed her a small corner office that would be hers. It even had a window. By the time she had gotten to her car  they called and offered her the job. The next day  the offer was rescinded when the company said it could not honor a degree from ITT Technical Institute. Ms. Berkhalter had completed four years of school  culminating in a 40-page thesis and a 25- minute presentation  and a certificate saying she had earned bachelor of science. Her $75 000 in G.I. Bill funds were gone. “But it was all for a degree that no one takes seriously ” Ms. Berkhalter said. “Whenever I told employers where I attended  I was shown the door.” Today  Ms. Berkhalter owes nearly $100 000. At times  she said  she has struggled to feed her children more than eggs and hot dogs. She stays home with her daughter  who was born with hip dysplasia  because she said she could not afford day care. Her husband’s salary barely covers the bills  and they rely on a range of government assistance programs. The family of six prays before they get into their 17-year-old vehicle  which seats four. Ms. Berkhalter has a loan forgiveness application pending at the Education Department  which she said she hoped would give her another shot at a degree  and give her four children a better life. “It would be life-changing ” she said  “to have that cloud removed from over my head.” Updated July 5  2020 None Advertisement ,articles/business

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/virus-fineprint-stimulus-bill.html,Fine Print of Stimulus Bill Contains Special Deals for Industries Advertisement Supported by Small banks  retailers and for-profit colleges got provisions they wanted. So did Boeing. Among those who could potentially benefit: President Trump’s company. None WASHINGTON — Restaurants and retailers will get a tweak to federal tax law they have been seeking for more than a year that could save them $15 billion. Community banks are being granted their long-held wish of being freed to reduce the amount of capital they have to hold in reserve. And for-profit colleges will be able to keep federal loan money from students who drop out because of the coronavirus. None None But it turns out that the provision might not preclude funds from going to companies owned by the family of Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser  Jared Kushner  while Mr. Trump’s companies would not be barred from benefiting from other elements of the bill intended to help broad swaths of American business. For example  certain hotel owners  even those employing thousands of people  will be eligible for small-business loans  a provision that could potentially benefit Mr. Trump’s company to help to continue to pay wages for his employees. The Trump Organization could also benefit from the $15 billion change to the tax code won by restaurants and retailers. None None None None While some industries and companies are benefiting from provisions tailored for them  others appear certain to get a piece of the pie through more general components of the bill  from the $454 billion general purpose fund for businesses and state and local governments to the $50 billion earmarked for airlines and $8 billion for air cargo carriers. The deal specifically sets aside $17 billion for “businesses critical to maintaining national security” — a category seen as intended at least partly for Boeing  the troubled aircraft manufacturer and Pentagon contractor  whose name appears nowhere in the bill. “We’ll be helping Boeing ” Mr. Trump said Tuesday evening. “We’ll be helping the airlines  the cruise lines.” As with any complex piece of legislation  this one will create winners and losers. None A spokesman for the Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump declined to respond to a question this week about whether his family business intended to take advantage of any of the tax breaks or other benefits included in the legislation. “I don’t know ” Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Sunday. “I just don’t know what the government assistance would be for what I have. I have hotels.” Many of these special-interest provisions would be impossible for a casual reader of the legislation to identify. For example  on Page 15 of the bill  there is a section with the title “Business Concerns With More Than 1 Physical Location.” It says this change in federal law will apply to companies that fit “a North American Industry Classification System code beginning with 72” — a reference that turns out to mean the hotel and restaurant industry. The provision says that if a company owns multiple hotels  even if the overall hotel or restaurant chain has more than 500 employees — the limit to qualify for treatment as a small business — it will still be able to take advantage of the small-business benefits offered in the rescue package. That means loans from the federal government worth up to 2.5 times the firm’s monthly payroll that will not have to be repaid if the company uses them to keep paying employees during any coronavirus shutdowns. Representatives from the American Hotel & Lodging Association reached out to Republicans and Democrats to push them to insert the language  arguing that it would allow the federal assistance to cover an additional 33 000 hotels  with a total of about one million employees. The large corporations that own the big brands — like Marriott or Hilton — would not be eligible. But any individual hotel  including from one of these brands  that has fewer than 500 employees would be. Many hotels are owned by franchisees. The provision could benefit the Trump Organization  which operates a relatively small chain  with six hotels in the United States in cities including New York  Washington and Chicago. Several Trump hotels are members of the trade association. A representative for the trade group said executives at the Trump Organization were not involved in the lobbying effort. Representatives of the Trump Organization did not respond to a question on Wednesday about the provision. The tweak to the tax code sought by the nation’s retailers and grocers could mean $15 billion a year worth of tax savings for hotels  restaurants  supermarkets and other retailers. Groups representing those industries separately intervened with both Mr. Trump and leaders on Capitol Hill to push lawmakers to include it in the final package. The provision could potentially benefit Mr. Trump’s companies  among many others  by allowing them to immediately write off money spent on renovations at hotels or restaurants  instead of having to take the deduction over 37 years. Industry lobbyists have been pushing for the change for more than a year. They have called it a technical correction to the 2017 tax legislation that Mr. Trump signed into law. The provision is simply called “Technical Amendments Regarding Qualified Improvement Property.” It would allow hotels  restaurants and retailers that have spent money fixing up their properties in the last two years to accelerate the way they write off those expenses  effectively giving them an immediate tax refund  Ms. Bernstein  the industry lobbyist said. They could then use the refund to help cover bills during the crisis. The special tax benefit would be retroactive to 2018 and would last for at least three more years  before it is gradually phased out. “If you let us amend our returns  we will be getting billions back and it will help us pay our employees and our rents and stay in business until consumers can come back into our stores ” Ms. Bernstein said  echoing the argument she said she made to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile  the provision inserted by Democrats to block the families of government officials from receiving certain assistance might not exempt the companies owned by the family of Mr. Kushner. None Mr. Kushner’s representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. None A provision in the bill would allow all colleges to retain federal funds allocated to help educate qualifying students  even if the students in question dropped out because of coronavirus-related emergencies. While the provision applies to all colleges  critics of for-profit colleges contend that  because those schools tend to have higher dropout rates  they would be able to retain more of the money they collect via federal loans to their students than would traditional nonprofit colleges. “What’s happening now is causing a crisis for all sectors of higher ed  and I understand the intent  but it would disproportionately help for-profit schools because their dropout rates are higher than other segments of higher ed ” said Toby Merrill  the founder of the Project on Predatory Student Lending. None It also includes $7.5 million for the Smithsonian Institution  as well as $75 million each for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities to provide grants to arts organizations  museums and libraries during the coronavirus outbreak. The bill also contains a six-month extension of federal funding through the end of November for abstinence-only education programs favored by social conservatives who are a critical Republican voting bloc. The extension is coupled with one for sex education programs that provide information about birth control and safe sex  which are supported by reproductive rights groups that tend to back Democrats. Provisions sought by the nation’s smaller banks  a powerful constituency  were also included in the bill. One change would allow those banks to have lower requirements for capital reserves  the buffer that financial institutions are required to keep on hand to ensure they remain solvent if they run into trouble. The industry late last year had fought for the change  and lost. This time the banks used the disaster to reopen the fight and get the lower capital requirements they wanted  arguing that it would allow them to do more lending to small businesses during the coronavirus emergency. The change would remain in effect as long as the virus emergency continued  although the industry is already discussing looking for ways to make it permanent.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/upshot/coronavirus-online-college-classes-unprepared.html,Everybody Ready for the Big Migration to Online College? Actually  No Advertisement Supported by One consequence of coronavirus: It will become more apparent that good online education is easier said than done. None Nobody planned for an abrupt mass migration of traditional college courses to the internet. But because of coronavirus  that’s where we are. Hundreds of thousands of students have been told to clear out their belongings and head home  many through the end of the semester. In nearly every case  colleges have said that instruction will continue online. None None Those students need courses that are not just accessible  but also well designed. None Colleges have also adopted so-called learning management systems  virtual platforms that help faculty interact with students on campus and off. Like all modern institutions  college now exists in a state of constant electronic connectivity. Ideally  online education accomplishes at least three distinct things: distance  scale and personalization. All of them will be hard for colleges to manage in the coming weeks. Tools for communicating at a distance have steadily improved over time. But they’re not perfect  as anyone who has ever participated in a video conference call can attest. None It takes practice and skill to teach effectively at a distance. Colleges have largely let individual faculty members decide whether to participate in online learning  and some have gotten very good at it. Others haven’t. Now the most traditional and recalcitrant instructors will have to do something difficult they’ve never done before. None One way to manage the problem of inexperienced online professors is to increase the number of students being taught by the most successful teachers. Scale is currently a big part of online college  because that’s where all the profits are. It’s why for-profit colleges got into the online game early  and why public and private institutions are rapidly growing their offerings now. But scale requires time and money upfront. The only way for one professor to reach hundreds or even thousands of students is to embed the learning process in technology. The simplest example is recording a lecture that students can view online. But effective online courses require much more. Many campuses now employ full-time “instructional designers” who help faculty map out courses and degree programs. They also create learning modules  online exercises  virtual laboratories and assessments. None It’s impossible to transform a college course into the virtual world overnight. Which means the students currently boxing up their clothes and laptops also won’t benefit from the advantages of technology-enabled personalization. Fully online courses are usually  in whole or in part  “asynchronous ” meaning that students can learn when they need to. A parent with a job can log on after putting the kids to bed at night  rather than hunt for a parking spot to make a 10 a.m. on-campus lecture. That’s a simple but powerful kind of personalization  particularly if people are caring for loved ones who are sick. While the popular idea of individual “learning styles” has been largely discredited by academic research  people still bring vastly different levels of knowledge  talent and context to the classroom  virtual or otherwise. The long-sought-after dream of technology-enabled education is to build machines that can assess these differences  react to them  and give students a better educational experience — personalized to what they know and need. There are decades of research in this field  and many promising theories and tools  but as of yet no breakthrough technologies in terms of cost and student learning. None College professors and administrators care deeply about the health and education of their students. In the coming weeks  they will rally around their responsibilities as teachers and develop many innovative solutions to the sudden challenge the pandemic has created. But in a sense  it’s a mistake to say that colleges will be “moving to online education.” All they’ll really be doing is conducting traditional education at a distance. That will be hard enough.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/us/politics/student-debt-relief-senate-devos.html,Senate Rejects DeVos Rule Restricting Debt Relief for Bilked Students Advertisement Supported by The rule  struck down by a bipartisan majority  sought to rewrite Obama-era debt relief measures  which allow students misled by schools to request that their loan debts be forgiven. None WASHINGTON — In a bipartisan rebuke  the Senate voted on Wednesday to overturn a major Trump administration rule that would sharply limit debt relief for students misled by schools that lured them in with false claims about their graduates’ career and earning prospects. In a 53-to-42 vote that included 10 Republicans  the Senate struck down a revised Education Department rule completed in September by the department’s secretary  Betsy DeVos. The House passed a companion resolution in January. The legislation will now go to President Trump  who will decide whether to uphold the rule with a veto or side with Congress over his own education secretary. He has told Senate Republicans he is “neutral” on repealing the rule  though he has yet to comment on his veto intentions. If Mr. Trump does not sign it  Democrats say they will press for a veto override. Senator Richard J. Durbin  Democrat of Illinois and the minority whip  successfully recruited Republicans for Wednesday’s vote after veterans groups — which he called a “critical ally” — backed his resolution. “These are men and women that we praise around the clock  around the calendar  and here was our chance to stand with them  and a number of Republicans wanted to do that ” Mr. Durbin said. “We found 10. I think we can find 10 more ” he added. None In a statement  the Education Department said its rule protected community colleges  historically black colleges and universities and taxpayers “from undue harm from the poorly written Obama-era regulation.” “It’s disappointing to see so many in Congress fooled by misinformation from the left and the fake news narrative about our efforts to protect students from fraud ” said Angela L. Morabito  a spokeswoman for the department. Critics said the DeVos regulations would effectively kill the department’s loan forgiveness program by imposing requirements that almost no borrowers would be able to meet. “The burden of proof for these students is so absurdly unrealistic ” said Representative Susie Lee  Democrat of Nevada  who sponsored the companion resolution in the House. Democrats emphasized that the original loan forgiveness rule  on the books since 1995  was little used until for-profit chains starting imploding in 2014. “These for-profit colleges are the coronavirus of higher education ” Mr. Durbin said on the Senate floor. None The Senate action poses a political quandary for Mr. Trump. He has pressed the Education Department for a proposal to match sweeping college debt plans put forth by Democratic presidential candidates. And veterans  who backed the Senate measure  have been key political supporters. None None “He had to pay $25 million for ripping off the kids ” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the minority leader  said at a recent news conference. “But many of these institutions have done even worse. Students cheated by the for-profit schools deserve the same support that those who went to Trump University have gotten.” So far  the Education Department has approved 51 000 loan-relief applications — nearly all of them during the Obama administration — and eliminated some $535 million in debt. About 170 000 applications still await a decision. None None “Instead of the department picking winners and losers  and targeting its political enemies  our rule ensures equitable treatment of all institutions ” Ms. Morabito said. “Our rule is consistent with Congress’s intent  it protects students  and it treats taxpayers fairly.” None But a crucial Republican lawmaker opposed the Senate measure: Senator Lamar Alexander  Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate’s education committee  who said the Obama-era rule went too far. “If your car is a lemon  you don’t sue the bank — you sue the dealer ” Mr. Alexander said on Tuesday in a floor speech. “A college can be a lemon just like a car can be. But unlike a car  if your college is a lemon  you do sue the bank — which is really the taxpayer.” Mr. Durbin responded on Wednesday to those comments by pointing out that Ms. DeVos’s rule also bars most students from suing their schools. Veterans have long been considered among the most vulnerable groups for predatory recruitment tactics because of their lucrative G.I. Bill benefits. The benefits are particularly attractive to for-profit schools  because federal law requires those schools to obtain at least 10 percent of their revenue from sources other than Education Department-backed student loans. G.I. Bill benefits help schools meet that quota. Standing alongside Democratic lawmakers last month at a news conference  seven organizations representing veterans and their families called on Congress to overturn Ms. DeVos’s rule. John Kamin  an assistant director of the veterans employment and education division at the American Legion  said the measure would protect veterans from “lucrative scams.” “It’s a fact that they are often singled out and targeted with deceptive  fraudulent and predatory college recruiting practices ” Mr. Kamin said. “This rule is not a pathway to relief for student veterans  it is a wall to it.” “Veterans had a target on their backs when they were in uniform  there’s no need to have one again when they go to college ” said James Haynes  the federal policy manager at Veterans Education Success. “These veterans need borrower defense. They need their government to stand up for them just as they stood up to serve our country. The 2016 rule did just that.” Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington  and Maggie Haberman from New York. Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/19/business/college-downturn-absorber.html,In a Sharp Downturn  College Can Be a Shock Absorber Advertisement Supported by economic view The lessons of the last recession were harsh but clear. Public colleges need plenty of money during economic declines. None If we don’t prepare now  higher education is likely to endure another big shock whenever the next recession comes. Expect overflowing public colleges and universities  students fleeing to for-profit colleges  a huge wave of student borrowing  and a spike in loan defaults — unless policy shifts now. Here’s the problem  in a nutshell. Public schools rely on government funding to keep the doors open and classes in session. But tuition paid by students doesn’t come close to covering the cost of public colleges and universities  which educate 80 percent of undergraduates. Taxpayers have always footed much of that bill. None The next economic downturn most likely won’t be as harsh as the last one  which was so bad we often call it the Great Recession. But all signs indicate that the next one will hit college students  especially those who borrow  just as hard  because we haven’t repaired the faults it revealed in how the United States finances colleges. None That’s because scarce jobs and low wages reduce the “opportunity cost” of college. During a boom  students have to give up strong wages to go to college. During a bust  the cost of losing those earnings is lower and so more people go to school. None Those low entry salaries then translate into smaller annual increases once the economy recovers. What’s worse  the effects persist for decades  penalizing a generation of wage earners. Getting more people into college during a recession helps to reduce the downward pressure on earnings that all of these people would create if they were instead searching for jobs. None Congress expanded the federal Pell Grant program  which subsidizes college for those with lower incomes  and it also increased the availability of tax credits for education. In economic terms  these price subsidies spurred demand for education  which was exactly the intended response. Yet something went very wrong. With tax revenues plunging  states slashed funding to colleges just as millions were seeking to enroll. Public colleges could not adequately educate the influx of students. As their state subsidies shrank  public colleges either restricted enrollment  spent less on educating each student  or raised tuition. Sometimes  they did all three. None None None None Community colleges serve as a place for building career skills  and as an entry point to postsecondary education for many disadvantaged people. College will pay off for many of them  and encouraging students to try it out makes sense. But by keeping tuition very low at community colleges  we can minimize the riskiness of the gamble. The lessons of the last recession were harsh but clear. We need to adequately support public colleges during economic downturns. This will require federal action  because many states have balanced-budget provisions in their constitutions that ban them from running a deficit. All tax revenue drops in a recession  but the federal government can offset this with deficit spending while the states’ hands are tied. None Advertisement ,articles/business

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-pawnshops.html,Virus Revives Italy’s Age-Old Shadow Safety Net: The Pawnshop Advertisement Supported by Italians have put up valuables as collateral for loans for centuries  through plagues and sieges. Today they do it as part of the formal banking system. And business is booming. None ROME — The economic repercussions of Italy’s lockdown to contain the coronavirus nearly wiped Anita Paris out. Her son  a car mechanic whom she depended on for financial support  couldn’t work. Her small pension didn’t suffice. The welfare checks she had hoped would pour in from the government didn’t materialize. And so Ms. Paris  a 75-year-old widow  turned to a shadow safety net that Italians have relied on for centuries  through plagues and sieges  wars and downturns. She rummaged through her home for “rings  necklaces  bracelets  everything I had around” and turned to the pawnshops that constitute an official  if anachronistic  part of the Italian banking system. “I have bills to pay ” Ms. Paris said after pawning off her things under a vaulted ceiling in the “Valuables Appraisal” hall of a baroque palace that has housed a pawnshop and the pawn departments of major banks for more than 400 years. “I have to get to the end of the month.” The economic picture for Italy  and for Italians in need of cash  does not look good. Banks  laden with debt and wary of taking on toxic loans  are unlikely to extend credit. The government’s aid packages and job security measures that have delivered billions of euros to struggling Italians are set to expire at the end of the summer  though the government is considering extending benefits. The Italian economy is estimated to contract by nearly 13 percent this year. Anxiety is palpable among Italians on pawnshop lines around the country. They worry that their short-term job contracts will run out  that customers will not fill their stores  that American tourists will not rent their rooms. But the managers of the collateral loan sector — the institutional name for pawnshops — aren’t complaining. Activity increased from 20 to 30 percent immediately after the lockdown  as clients wanted to make sure they met their interest payments but also sought new loans. And with emergency benefits about to wind down  they expect business to surge. “In the autumn  we will see more financial problems than what we have seen ” Rainer Steger  the director general of the pawnbroker conglomerate Affide  said in his Rome office  where he looked like any bank manager in a suit and tie. “Maybe we can lend a hand.” In the United States  pawnshops are associated with bulletproof glass partitions  “Guns  Gold and Cash” lawn signs and reality show spinoffs (“Hardcore Pawn”). In Italy  they have been part of the banking system for centuries. Money changers in the Lombardy region worked with collateral in the Middle Ages. The Catholic church in the 15th century sought to combat usury by pooling the resources of wealthy locals into a Mount of Piety. The idea was to create a pile of cash to make no-interest — and thus no-sin — loans to the poor  and to undercut moneylenders  often consisting of a Jewish minority who had less access to other professions. To this day  these businesses remain a niche part of large banks. “When things are going well you can buy your stuff back ” said Claudio Lorenzo  65  a crossing guard who stopped working when schools closed and who waited outside the pawnshop of a Milan bank to pay interest on his and his wife’s wedding rings. “When things are going bad  you can’t.” In July 2018  Affide’s parent company  Dorotheum  an auction house and pawn credit service based in Vienna that is more than 300 years old  bought the pawn unit of the Italian banking giant UniCredit. In February  Dorotheum bought its largest pawnbroker competitor  Creval  and now has more than 40 branches throughout Italy. Affide is headquartered in a 16th-century palace in the Mount of Piety square in Rome  the home of pawnshops for centuries  purposefully established near the old Jewish Ghetto. Mr. Steger said big banks had turned away from their pawnshop roots at precisely the wrong time  with the economic fallout from the virus sure to generate a need for ready cash. “There’s movement ” he said as he looked at experts examining gold rings and watches through loupes in a marble hall. In an adjacent “Renewal and Disengagement” department  clients paid interest or bought back their items. Above their heads  black numbered boxes transported possessions from an upstairs vault  moving slowly along a suspended track like an upside-down train set. None “They are making bucketloads of money ” Giuseppe Martino  a third-generation owner of one of the many gold-buying stores that have sprouted around the palace over the centuries  said spitefully. He complained that nobody was buying his gold  just pawning possessions off. “They are hoping this virus goes on and on.” Defenders of the big pawnshops say only 5 percent of items are put up for auction  and that they are providing a vital service to working- and lower-middle-class Italians who need cash  and that their microcredit — the average loan is for less than 1 000 euros — keeps the vulnerable out of the hands of loan sharks and prevents predatory usury. They say that they offer a more straightforward  and transparent  system than many modern banking instruments  and that unlike banks that check credit lines and investigate financial history  anyone who passes a criminal record check  satisfies money laundering precautions and presents items of real value (“not a fake Rolex ” Mr. Steger said) could get access to cash. Clients deposit valuables as collateral  and then pay interest over a set period. If the client fails to pay up  the item may be put up for auction. In that case  the pawnbroker recoups its loan  and if a profit is made at the auction  it goes to the client. On a recent morning in Naples  scores of people crowded outside the pawn branch of the Bank of Naples  which is owned by the financial giant Intesa Sanpaolo.  Silvia Agora  47  had nearly earned enough money as a hairdresser to redeem the gold bracelets her family had pawned. Then the lockdown closed her salon for three months. When it reopened in May  social distancing restrictions drastically reduced the number of customers. Now she was here to make more interest payments. “We were getting close ” she said  about reclaiming the heirlooms. “Now it’s impossible.” The Italian government pumped billions to Italian families  and made billions more in furlough payments to keep a promise that no Italian worker would be fired because of the virus. But Eleanora Fucci  45  said she had not received those furlough payments. She used to sell bags at the Naples airport  but then the flights stopped coming. The store closed in March  tourism crashed and plans to reopen look doubtful. She said her savings were nearly used up. The mother of two said that her friends had started taking in laundry or ironing and that she was considering doing it also. “One way or another ” she said. “You have to find a way to make things work.” Francesco Nardelli  43  who works as an orderly in a nursing home on short-term contracts  emerged from the bank  where he paid interest on his mother’s gold bracelets. He said his most recent contract had expired in March. He was put on a new month-to-month contract  which reduced his pay by half — a starting position  despite his previous experience. “I had to start all over again ” he said  his wife and son by his side. “There is no security.” The gold and jewelry-backed loans business of Gruppo Intesa Sanpaolo is in the process of being acquired by Banca Sistema  where a spokeswoman said new pawnbroker policies increased by 20 percent in March and April. Much of the increase has been in the Italian north  where the virus hit hardest. Outside UBI Bank in Milan  a furloughed cook  the owner of a ballet-costume company and dozens of others waited their turn on a recent day.  Katia Marchesi  57  stood in line to make an interest payment on the gold chains and medals she and her daughter had received for their christenings and communions. Ms. Marchesi said that she lost her cleaning job  but because it was off the books  she didn’t apply for government support. She was willing to pawn more valuables. “But ” she added  “I don’t have anything else.” Emma Bubola contributed reporting from Milan. Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/opinion/sunday/banks-reparations-racism-inequality.html,Banks Should Face History and Pay Reparations Advertisement Supported by The financial industry can close the wealth gap and serve as a model for a nation struggling to reckon with racism. None Ms. Blackwell is founder in residence at PolicyLink  a research and advocacy institute  where Mr. McAfee is the chief executive. Corporate chief executives have been tripping over themselves to demonstrate their support for racial justice. They’ve taken a knee  tweeted that black lives matter  donated money to advocacy groups and affirmed their commitment to inclusion. That’s all well and good. And following through on their promises — by hiring and promoting more people of color  diversifying boards and executive suites and paying all workers decent wages and essential benefits — would be even better. But business leaders who are serious about fighting racism will hold themselves accountable for the bitter inequities they have helped to create and sustain  and from which they have profited. Every industry must now use its power to repair the damage and heal the wounds. The financial industry is a good place to start. Banks have been underwriters of American racism — no industry has played a bigger or more enduring role in black oppression  exploitation and exclusion. Banks financed the slave trade and in some cases “repossessed” humans in bondage. White-owned banks refused to serve black people who left the South escaping brutality and seeking opportunity during the Great Migration of the early and mid-20th century. Bank policies and practices contributed to segregating every major city and denying black families the two most important toeholds to the middle class — ownership of homes and of businesses. Federal legislation beginning in the 1960s prohibited the most blatant discrimination in banking and lending. It banned redlining  the practice named for the color-coded maps that lenders used to deny mortgages in black neighborhoods. But banks and real estate agents found ways to exploit the desire of black people to own homes  leaving many in foreclosure. Racial disparities in access to the conventional mortgage market endured  leaving black home buyers vulnerable to fraud and risky loans  as the subprime mortgage fiasco exposed so painfully. None Similarly  banks deny loans to black-owned businesses at twice the rate of white-owned ones. This makes it difficult  if not impossible  for small black companies to grow. But the industry doesn’t only suppress black wealth  it aggressively strips it  through excessive interest rates on consumer debt  egregious overdraft penalties and higher fees even for simple A.T.M. transactions. It’s no surprise that the median black family had roughly one-tenth of the wealth of a white family as of 2016. The gap not only limits education and career options  it’s also a source of gnawing anxiety about how the bills will get paid in the event of a job loss or costly illness — setbacks facing millions of families  again disproportionately black  during the Covid-19 pandemic. None A federal reparations policy is unlikely to come anytime soon. But banks and financial institutions don’t have to wait. First  they must apologize for their culpability for and complicity in structural racism. Next  they must commit to serving black people as they do whites. Then  with these four bold policies  the industry can start to close the wealth gap  repair the harms and serve as a model for a nation struggling to reckon with racism: None Black families on average had $8 554 in consumer debt in September 2019. And they pay more for debt — about $735 a year in interest on every $10 000 they borrow  compared with $514 for white families. Because they have less access to conventional banks and the mortgage market  many black families are forced to rely on high-interest alternatives such as payday loans. Additionally  black people are hit with higher bank fines and harsher punishment  including wage garnishment  for loan defaults  making it harder to climb out of debt. Freeing families from the drag of this debt would help them build savings and obtain financial security. None That’s because banks in communities of color generally require higher opening balances and minimums to avoid fees  and they charge more for A.T.M. transactions and overdrafts. Seemingly small differences in bank fees pay off handsomely for the industry. None Ending these egregious practices would make banking more attractive to black consumers. None Given the persistent racism in the mortgage market and the subprime mortgage disaster  which not only resulted in homeownership disparities but also limited the value of homes owned by black people  banks must provide interest-free mortgages to black home buyers. These loans could be capped at the regional median loan value and should be in place until black homeownership is on par with white homeownership. Expanding secure homeownership for black families and creating opportunities for them to buy in markets where real estate enjoys healthy increases in value will improve economic mobility and begin to create generational wealth. None None Going forward  banks should provide interest-free loans to black-owned businesses at the regional median amount until black businesses are sufficiently capitalized to be competitive in the markets in which they operate. Unleashing the creativity of black entrepreneurship will reap huge benefits for the entire society. Inevitably  the industry will assert that laws  regulations or shareholders prevent taking these steps. But legal obstacles have not stopped banks from pursuing bold  sometimes risky  strategies in the past. They use their mighty skills  money and influence to make a way when they believe profits and benefits await. Now the industry must make a down payment on a secure future for black America  which really is a secure future for America. None That requires more than taking a knee. It demands taking a stand.

None The authors focus on global climate finance at Rocky Mountain Institute. The coronavirus crisis has forced the federal government to step up suddenly with fiscal stimulus to sustain the U.S. economy and help avoid a global depression. This necessary intervention comes at a price — a spike in federal debt that will need to be repaid over the long term.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/business/corporate-bankruptcy-coronavirus.html,A Tidal Wave of Bankruptcies Is Coming Advertisement Supported by Experts foresee so many filings in the coming months that the courts could struggle to salvage the businesses that are worth saving. None Already  companies large and small are succumbing to the effects of the coronavirus. They include household names like Hertz and J. Crew and comparatively anonymous energy companies like Diamond Offshore Drilling and Whiting Petroleum. None None Even a meaningful rebound in economic activity over the coming months won’t stop it  said Mr. Altman  the Max L. Heine professor of finance  emeritus  at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “The really hurting companies are too far gone to be saved ” he said. None More than 6 800 companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year  and this year will almost certainly have more. The flood of petitions from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression could swamp the system  making it harder to save the companies that can be rescued  bankruptcy experts said. Most good-size companies that go into bankruptcy try to restructure themselves  working out payment agreements for their debts so they can stay open. But if a plan can’t be worked out — or isn’t successful — they can be liquidated instead. Equipment and property are sold off to pay debts  and the company disappears. Without reform in the system  “we anticipate that a significant fraction of viable small businesses will be forced to liquidate  causing high and irreversible economic losses ” a group of academics said in a letter to Congress in May. “Workers will lose jobs even in otherwise viable businesses.” Among their suggestions: increasing budgets to recall retired judges and hire more clerks  and giving companies more time to come up with workable plans to prevent them from being sold off for parts. “Tight deadlines may lead to overly optimistic restructuring plans and subsequent refilings that will congest courts and delay future recoveries ” they wrote. None But in many cases  the coronavirus crisis exposed deeper problems  like staggering debts run up by companies whose business models were already struggling to deal with changes in consumer behavior. None None None None A run of defaults looks almost inevitable. At the end of the first quarter of this year  U.S. companies had amassed nearly $10.5 trillion in debt — by far the most since the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis began tracking the figure at the end of World War II. “An explosion in corporate debt ” Mr. Altman said. Having a lot more debt to deal with is likely to make the coming bankruptcies a bruising experience for unsecured creditors  who may include retirees with pensions or health benefits  vendors waiting to be paid  tort plaintiffs whose lawsuits are cut short and sometimes even current workers. If a company goes into bankruptcy with more secured debts than the value of its assets  the secured creditors — including vulture investors who bought up the debt for a song — can walk away with virtually everything. The sums at play in some of these cases will be enormous. Mr. Altman expects at least 66 cases with more than $1 billion in debt this year  eclipsing 2009’s mark of 49. He also predicted 192 bankruptcies involving at least $100 million in debt  which would trail only 2009’s record of 242. Robert J. Keach  a director of the American College of Bankruptcy  said many companies had so far managed to put off bankruptcy by amassing cash and conserving it as best they can: drawing down existing credit lines  furloughing workers  delaying projects and taking advantage of federal and state pandemic-relief programs. But when those programs expire  the companies will start burning through their cash. That’s when bankruptcy filings are likely to soar and stay elevated  Mr. Keach said. Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected.

The loans can be converted to grants if the companies meet certain requirements  and if the borrowers can put off bankruptcy until they’re sure they won’t have to pay the money back  they will have more cash when they file. That’s an important consideration  because Chapter 11 is expensive. A bankrupt company must pay the fees of the lawyers and other professionals that help it reorganize  as well as the fees of those who advise the official creditors’ committees. The experts’ recommendations to Congress walk a fine line. They suggest allowing companies more time to come up with reorganization plans  even though Chapter 11 cases are supposed to move quickly so bankrupt companies don’t burn through their cash before they reorganize. Generally  the longer a company stays in bankruptcy  the greater the chances of a liquidation. And that increases the likelihood that the company’s troubles will spread: Suppliers of raw materials could fold if a manufacturer languishes in bankruptcy  and smaller stores in entirely differently lines of business can suffer if a shopping-mall anchor can’t stay open. These risks are real  said Robert E. Gerber  who retired in 2016 as a bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of New York. One of his cases was the 2009 bankruptcy of General Motors  which moved at lightning speed to keep the automaker from going under for good. “If G.M. had failed  God knows how many companies in the supply chain would have failed  and this would have snowballed terribly ” said Mr. Gerber  who is now of counsel with the Joseph Hage Aaronson firm. The cascade would have wiped out paychecks to workers throughout the supply chain  threatening other businesses and even the finances of the local governments that count on them for tax revenue. That  Mr. Gerber said  makes it imperative that the bankruptcy system have the resources to deal with the coming rush of cases. “Bankruptcy can’t print money for those companies ” he said  “but it can give a good number of them a chance of survival.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/energy-environment/pge-bankruptcy-court-approval.html,PG&E’s Plan to Resolve Bankruptcy Wins Court Approval Advertisement Supported by A federal judge decided Saturday that the California utility can put itself back together in time to take part in a crucial wildfire liability fund. None None None None None None “PG&E is committed to emerging from Chapter 11 as a fundamentally improved and transformed utility that meets the highest safety  governance  and operational standards ” Bill Johnson  PG&E’s chief executive  said in a statement  referring to the type of bankruptcy case the company filed. Under its bankruptcy plan  the company will pay its bondholders what they are owed  and its existing shareholders would continue to own a big chunk of PG&E  an unusual outcome in Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases like this one. Usually  shareholders are left with nothing or a tiny percentage of the restructured company. None None The restructured PG&E will have a larger debt than when it went into bankruptcy. As a regulated utility  it will in theory be able to shoulder that bigger financial burden. But if PG&E’s equipment is again involved in large wildfires or other disasters  its finances might come under strain  even with the protection of the state wildfire fund  which lawmakers created to help investor-owned utilities. Gov. Gavin Newsom and state regulators have signed off on the company’s reorganization plan  a prerequisite for the company’s participation in the fund. Access to the fund will give investors some confidence in PG&E’s ability to withstand multibillion-dollar damage claims in the future. In negotiations with PG&E  Mr. Newsom got executives to agree that the state could take it over if the utility failed to fulfill its obligations under the bankruptcy plan. The company recently appointed a new interim chief executive and overhauled its board to satisfy the governor. None None Separately  the California Public Utilities Commission has levied a nearly $2 billion penalty against PG&E for defective maintenance and needless deaths from wildfires in 2017 and 2018. The company’s critics say PG&E and its shareholders have gotten away with a relatively light punishment from regulators  lawmakers and the courts given the deaths and destruction the utility has caused. Mark Toney  executive director of the Utility Reform Network  which represents consumers  said policymakers ought to come down hard on the company if its equipment is again implicated in wildfires and other disasters. “PG&E has been given plenty of chances and has bungled them all ” he said. “There should be no more chances for PG&E.” None Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/business/hertz-bankruptcy-stock-sale.html,Hertz: And Now for Something Completely Worthless Advertisement Supported by Strategies Hertz is bankrupt  yet it moved to sell new stock anyway. For sheer audacity  our columnist says  this takes his breath away. None Typically  when a company offers stock to the public  it emphasizes the positive. Fundamentally  the pitch is this: Buy us and prosper. Maybe even get rich. None Hertz  you see  is bankrupt. But it said it hoped to sell $500 million in shares  maybe even $1 billion  anyway. For sheer audacity  what Hertz was trying just takes my breath away. It caught the eye of the Securities and Exchange Commission  too. On Wednesday  Jay Clayton  the agency’s chairman  said on CNBC  “We have let the company know that we have comments on their disclosure ” and added  “In most cases  when you let a company know that the S.E.C. has comments on their disclosure  they do not go forward until those comments are resolved.” By Thursday  Hertz decided “that it was in the best interests of the company to terminate” the offering. The S.E.C. declined to expand on Mr. Clayton’s statement  and Hertz did not respond to repeated requests for comment. What is unusual in the Hertz stock venture is that the company is still in the early stages of what are formally known as Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Companies in bankruptcy do not  as a rule  sell stock  precisely because creditors have a higher claim on assets than shareholders do. By the time the creditors have been paid a fraction of what they are owed  there may be nothing left for shareholders. None Issuing additional shares of stock while the bankruptcy process is still underway is a fabulous idea  if you hold the company’s bonds  said Michael Cazayoux  who has analyzed Hertz’s bonds for KDP Investment Advisors. “The money that the new shareholders pay may go right to the bondholders ” he said. That’s one reason he had given Hertz bonds a “buy” rating. They were trading for around 40 cents on the dollar but may have been worth more than 50 cents . On the face of it  though  if the new stock sale had been permitted  it would have been a very bad deal for shareholders. “That’s why  normally  this just doesn’t happen ” he said. But there is always a first attempt  and this may well have been it. None Hertz  to its credit  disclosed the risks to prospective stock shareholders quite openly. If it had been permitted to proceed with the sale  buyers could not have said they weren’t warned. The prospectus said clearly that on May 22  the giant car rental company entered bankruptcy proceedings because it could not pay all of its debts. As a consequence  it said  there was a “significant risk” that by the time the company’s lenders were through with it  all of its stock — not just the shares in the potential new offering — would turn out to be “worthless.” In fact  it used the word “worthless” seven times  like a series of hazard lights set up along a long and dangerous road  so even unwary  inexperienced or perversely oblivious drivers will see at least one of them. Here is a representative sample. It appeared in boldface  much like this  so you couldn’t miss it: None None None Barbara Roper  director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America  said  “What immediately came to mind for me were the stock disclosures you used to see for I.P.O.s during the dot-com bubble in the middle of 1990s  where the companies explained in vivid detail that they had no prospects for ever making a profit — and people bought those stocks like hot cakes.” None None None Of course  the current era is different. The stock market’s volatility — and many of Hertz’s problems — are  to a large extent  caused by the coronavirus pandemic  and may well be relieved if and when the pandemic recedes decisively. None For extreme risk takers  a new offering of stock from a bankrupt company could conceivably have some value  said Jay R. Ritter  a finance professor at the University of Florida. Mr. Ritter said he teaches that a stock is “an option on the future value of a firm.” If that future value is somewhere between zero and  say  $2 billion  the stock might be “worth something as long as there’s a possibility” that the company will end up being worth something. But that’s a gamble  in my estimation  not an investment. It sure isn’t something I would have counted on. As Ms. Roper put it: “What Hertz is doing raises serious concerns for investors.” But  like Pets.com  Hertz is creating a wonderful spectacle. While social distancing  enjoy bankruptcy from the sidelines. Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/business/economy/virus-bailout-oversight.html,Lack of Transparency Could Hinder Virus Bailout  Oversight Board Warns Advertisement Supported by A Pandemic Response Accountability Committee report called for more accurate information about bailout spending. None None None “Key areas of concern include both the need for accurate information concerning pandemic-related spending and the significant amount of money federal agencies may lose as the result of improper payments ” the report said. None One of those programs  a $150 billion fund to help state and local governments  has been flagged by Treasury’s inspector general for a “lack of accountability and transparency.” Recipients of coronavirus relief funds have gotten money “without agreements or terms and conditions establishing requirements for the use of funds and reporting on such uses  among other things ” the report said. The committee said Treasury had agreed to work with its inspector general to develop guidance that would ensure fund applicants and recipients were complying with the law and that records were available for audit work. Another program  one aimed at keeping small businesses afloat through forgivable loans  also came under criticism for how it had been designed and overseen by the Small Business Administration and Treasury. The committee warned that the government could face financial losses on the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program  which has been designed to avoid making banks and other lenders assume any risk for the loans they extend. That could allow money to go to borrowers who did not qualify for the program and result in unpaid loans. The scale of the program and the speed at which the agency is working to process loans has also opened the door to potential fraud  the report warned. “Increased loan volume  loan amounts and expedited loan processing time frames may make it more difficult for S.B.A. to identify red flags in loan applications ” the report said. Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent  after it hit 14.7 percent in April  which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead  with employers adding 2.5 million jobs  after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. None None The review comes amid a growing fight among the committee  lawmakers and the Treasury Department over how much information the Trump administration should be required to disclose about those receiving bailout funds. None Democrats and Republicans in Congress have been pressing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to be more forthcoming about the whereabouts of the bailout money  particularly information about which companies have received small business loans. While some publicly traded companies have voluntarily disclosed receiving loans  private businesses are not required to release that information  and the Treasury Department has refused to provide a list of which companies received money.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/business/coronavirus-poor-countries-debt.html,Poor Countries Face a Debt Crisis ‘Unlike Anything We Have Seen’ Advertisement Supported by Dozens of countries that borrowed from private investors have debt payments coming due as their economies have crashed because of the coronavirus. None From Angola to Jamaica to Ecuador to Zambia  the world’s poor countries have had their finances shredded by the global pandemic. The president of Tanzania has called on “our rich brothers” to cancel his country’s debt. Belarus veered toward a default when a promised $600 million loan from Russia fell through. Russia couldn’t spare the money because the ruble had taken a nose-dive  along with oil and gas prices. Lebanon  troubled even before the pandemic  has embarked on its first debt restructuring. And Argentina has defaulted again — for the ninth time in its history. The low interest rates of the past decade led to an unlikely alliance between poor countries and international investors. Governments  state-owned companies and other businesses were able to raise money relatively cheaply to finance their growth  while investors searching for better returns than they were getting at home gobbled up that debt. As a result  developing countries owe record amounts of money to investors  governments and others outside their borders: $2.1 trillion for countries ranked as “low income” and “lower-middle income” by the World Bank  including Afghanistan  Chad  Bolivia and Zimbabwe. Now  the pandemic is fraying that alliance. Economic activity has ground to a halt  closing ports  shutting factories  canceling flights and emptying resorts. Governments are on the hook for billions of dollars in interest and principal repayments — payments suddenly made more expensive by volatility in the currency markets at the same time that public health costs are skyrocketing. And their investors are not in a forgiving mood. “This is really unlike anything we have seen ” said Mitu Gulati  a law professor at Duke University who studies the debts of countries  or sovereign debt. “The last time we had this many countries likely to go under at the same time was in the 1980s.” In Latin America  that period was known as La Década Perdida — The Lost Decade. Resolving those debts took years of negotiations  austerity measures and stalled economic development. But the debt crisis brewing today could be even harder to sort out. None None None Private investors have bought up more debt than official lenders in Latin American  East Asian and emerging European countries. These countries tend to issue bonds in dollars or other hard currencies. Now  their own currencies have plummeted in value as investors around the world sought refuge in the dollar — Brazil’s is down more than 30 percent against the dollar this year. That means it takes more of their own currency to buy every dollar they need to pay their debts. At the same time  they’re spending heavily on everything from hand-washing stations in places without tap water to airlifts of protective equipment for medical workers. “The abruptness of this shock is much larger than the 2008 global financial crisis ” said Ramin Toloui  an assistant Treasury secretary for international finance during the Obama administration. The International Monetary Fund has already expanded two emergency loan programs  and more than 100 countries have applied. Some  like Jamaica and Uzbekistan  have begun drawing their loans  while others are still being reviewed. The programs will help in the short term  Mr. Toloui said  but much more financial assistance will be required to keep poor countries solvent during a global shock. The I.M.F. itself has estimated the borrower countries’ total current need  from all sources  at $2.5 trillion. During La Década Perdida  the debt that was crushing Latin America mainly involved loans from groups of banks  which spent years restructuring the loans  while the I.M.F. pushed to reduce government waste and inefficiency and make the local economies more productive. The process required cooperation  and if a bank tried to hold out  it might get a stern call from a regulator to bring it back on board. The mix of creditors is different today. There are institutions like the World Bank  individual governments that have lent money — often to finance trade — and private-sector investors. So far  the private investors are the only ones that have been reluctant to give the countries a break. None Those organizations have called on bond funds and other private investors to join the suspension on comparable terms. The response has been slow. It took the Institute of International Finance  a trade group from around the globe  nearly four weeks to offer a proposal. The group’s members — banks  insurers  hedge funds and other financial entities — say debt forgiveness is complicated by their fiduciary duties to their clients. On Thursday  the group said that it would be up to each investor to decide whether to go along with a moratorium  and that any skipped interest payments would be tacked on to the borrowers’ principal. In other words  the countries would come out of the moratorium with more debt than they went in with. Christian Kopf  head of fixed income at Union Investment Group  a large German asset manager with funds that own emerging market debt  said the approach that official institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund were taking wouldn’t work for many investors. That’s because suspending payments on bonds results in a default. Updated June 30  2020 None None None None None None None None The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May  the Labor Department said on June 5  an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected.

None None “Contractually  under the prospectuses and circulars of the bonds fund that we offer  we are not allowed to own defaulted bonds ” he said. Investors would be forced to sell their bonds  and credit rating firms would be required to downgrade the countries. “It would destroy for years to come the market access of those countries ” Mr. Kopf said. In remarks to a United Nations group on Thursday  the president of the World Bank  David Malpass  did not directly address the predictions that a breather could cause mass selling and turn borrower countries into pariahs. “Much more is needed  including longer-term debt service relief and  in many cases  permanent and significant debt reduction ” he said. Mr. Malpass also said commercial creditors had to find a way to take part “and not exploit the debt relief of others.” Mr. Gulati  the Duke law professor  said he wondered if any solution could be reached in time for borrowers to skip their June bond payments without being deemed to be in default. Decisions by the I.M.F.  World Bank and G20 to let the countries skip payments will certainly free up cash  he said. But that doesn’t mean the countries will put it toward the costs of the public health crisis. If the private investors don’t get on board  the money could move into their pockets instead. “That relief ” he said  “can be used to pay the private creditors on time and in full.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/nyregion/cigarette-tax-nj-budget.html,New Jersey May Raise Cigarette Taxes to Highest Level in Nation Advertisement Supported by The state budget proposal includes a $4.35 per pack tax  an increase designed to discourage tobacco use and generate revenue. None UNION  N.J. — Zahir Shabazz smokes about three packs of cigarettes a week. Each time he runs out  he hands a cashier $10  give or take  and a slim pack of Newports appears  feeding a habit of nearly 30 years. He said he knows it is time to quit. “It’s too much ” he said. But Mr. Shabazz  42  of Union  N.J.  could soon wind up paying even more. Gov. Philip D. Murphy released a proposed budget on Tuesday that included a $1.65 increase in New Jersey’s cigarette tax. If it is approved  the tax on each pack would climb to the nation’s highest statewide level  $4.35. Smokers would also pay a state sales tax. None None None None The rate of cigarette usage among adults in New Jersey and nationwide has been steadily declining. None None If the price of a pack of cigarettes were to climb close to $12  Mr. Shabazz said he would probably quit for good. “It’s a mental thing ” he said. “$10 — that’s it.” He approves of the tax increase. “It’s going to help somebody stop smoking ” said Mr. Shabazz  who was about 13 when he started. “At least that’s the plan  I hope.” None None When taxes increase  cigarette sales decline  according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “It’s the most effective way to reduce tobacco use ” said Matthew L. Myers  president of the campaign  the largest anti-tobacco public advocacy group in the world. “Raising taxes reduces tobacco use and increases revenue — both in ways that we can predict.” None None “Criminal organizations exploit these higher costs by selling smuggled  counterfeit  illegally imported and stolen tobacco products ” he said. “Illicit activity deprives governments of tax revenue and hurts law-abiding businesses.” The budget proposed by Mr. Murphy  a Democrat  must be approved by the Democrat-led Assembly and Senate. The governor’s $40.85 billion spending plan also included a renewed call for the so-called millionaire’s tax  which would lift the tax rate on earnings over $1 million to 10.75 percent  up from 8.97 percent  and generate an estimated $494 million a year. “Asking the wealthiest 22 000 New Jerseyans to pay two cents more  in income tax  for every dollar they make over $1 million  so we can provide nearly $500 million more in property tax relief to New Jersey’s families is simple fairness ” Mr. Murphy said in an address to the Legislature. Stephen M. Sweeney  the powerful Senate president  has signaled a new willingness to support the millionaire’s tax if an extra $1 billion was invested in the state’s depleted pension fund.  Mr. Sweeney said he was not in favor of any other new taxes  including a cigarette tax. The Democratic leader of the Assembly  Craig J. Coughlin  also said he was “cautious of increasing broad-based taxes.” Jamal Amrany  the manager of Quick Convenience store in Union  said cigarettes are already a “tough business” because of high costs associated with stocking a wide variety of brands and a profit margin that is lower than on other items he sells. But he said he does not believe longtime smokers would be affected by an increase  even one as high as $1.65. “They’ll complain ” he said  “but they have to have it.” Michael Stephenson  63  of Montclair  N.J.  said he stopped smoking about 20 years ago  partially because of the price. He said the addiction is powerful  but money can be a strong motivator. “Hopefully ” Mr. Stephenson said  “people will get smart and decide they don’t want to pay that much.” Advertisement ,articles/business

None None Consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks dropped nearly 25 percent in the 18 months after Chile adopted a raft of regulations that included advertising restrictions on unhealthy foods  bold front-of-package warning labels and a ban on junk food in schools. During the same period  researchers recorded a five percent increase in purchases of bottled water  diet soft drinks and fruit juices without added sugar. None None None None None None None None The study  which tracked the purchasing habits of 2 000 households from 2015 to 2017  found that the drop in sugary-beverage consumption occurred both among the highly educated and those without a high school degree  although the reductions were somewhat greater among individuals who attended college. None The food industry’s initial resistance to the measures has largely faded. To avoid having to display the dreaded stop signs on their products  companies like Nestlé  Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have reformulated hundreds of products  reducing the amount of sodium in salad dressings and substituting artificial sweeteners for sugar in carbonated drinks. Asked to comment on the new study  a number of companies expressed a grudging acceptance of Chile’s laws but called for additional studies to assess their impact on obesity.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/business/Billion-Dollar-Brands.html,They Changed the Way You Buy Your Basics None Founders of Dollar Shave Club  Warby Parker and other billion-dollar companies exploited giant rivals’ weaknesses — and really listened to their customers. None Supported by None At 6:15 in the morning on March 6  2012  Michael Dubin woke up and checked his computer. He was puzzled by what he saw — actually  by what he didn’t see. Before going to bed  he had posted a video about his start-up  a company that virtually no one had ever heard of. But his venture’s website wasn’t working. Even though everything had been set the night before  the site had crashed. So he hopped into the shower before heading to sort things out at the cramped office he shared at a start-up incubator with other entrepreneurs who couldn’t afford to rent space themselves. Dubin was 33 years old. He was at this point an unsuccessful — well  failed — entrepreneur. A few years earlier  after the financial markets’ meltdown  he got laid off from a digital marketing job at Time Inc.’s “Sports Illustrated Kids” and applied to Columbia  New York University  UCLA and a few other business schools to get an MBA  but he was turned down. By all of them. Frustrated  he moved to Los Angeles  where he stayed rent-free at a cousin’s apartment while deciding what he wanted to do. After leaving Time  he did some consulting work for friends who had a holiday decorations business. Then he worked at a digital marketing firm in Los Angeles  developing and placing promotional videos online. After less than a year  he departed after a disagreement over the company’s strategy. His family and friends wondered if he’d ever find something he was both good at and liked. None What happened the morning of March 6 would change that  thanks to his start-up’s one-minute  thirty-three-second video. The good news was that the video was going viral  and a whole lot of people had been watching it. The bad news was that so many people were trying to watch it that the computer server was crashing at times  or sluggish when it worked. The tech company managing the Dollar Shave Club website had put an expert to work trying to fix the problem. Then a second. Then a third  with little success. At 10:30 that morning  it sent an unnerving email to Dubin: “We have been working for three hours already to keep it working stable.” Dubin was in a panic. After all his false starts  this was his chance. None Against all odds  Dollar Shave Club would go on to succeed wildly  with annual sales approaching $200 million when it was acquired by Unilever for $1 billion in 2016. Dubin helped usher in a business model for 21st century entrepreneurs to take on previously unassailable consumer brands: Technology had the potential to change the world of physical goods and the way brands are created. He recognized that technology and globalization were leveling the playing field. You didn’t need to start with a big advertising budget to get the attention of consumers. You didn’t need a manufacturing plant. You didn’t need to spend millions of dollars on research and development. You didn’t need a retailer to carry your product. By targeting a corporate giant’s weakness — high prices or inconvenience or a stodgy image — a clever start-up with the right strategy  the right message and the right product value could create a new national brand virtually overnight. All this was happening at a time that more consumers in their twenties and thirties were up for grabs. They lived digital lives  so were accustomed to — happy to! — buy things online. Not long ago  it would have been difﬁcult to imagine that a start-up company could take signiﬁcant sales from Gillette  the giant global corporation that had long controlled 70 percent of the country’s sales of razors. Astonishingly  Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s  a rival launched a year later  have done just that. By 2018  the two start-ups together had grabbed nearly 14 percent of U.S. razor blade sales. The direct-to-consumer brand revolution is one of the most dominant forces in the retailing business today. It began with a handful of start-ups  then grew to dozens  then hundreds — from mattresses (Casper) to bras (ThirdLove) to electric toothbrushes (Quip) to vitamins (Ritual) to tampons (Lola) to luggage (Away) to sneakers (Allbirds) to makeup (Glossier) to hair color (eSalon) to pet food (Farmer’s Dog) — and even thousands  counting the brands ﬁlling the endless digital aisles and shelves of Amazon Marketplace. Between 2013 and 2017  some $17 billion in sales shifted from big consumer brands to small brands — and that was before many of the latest start-ups began getting traction. This trend is likely to strengthen in the coming years  thanks in large part to the continued growth of sales on Amazon. In 2018  small and medium-size companies sold $160 billion in goods on Amazon  up from just $100 million in 1999  a 1 600-fold increase. While some of those companies are reselling products made by others  many of them  including Amazon itself  are creating their own new brands. Entrepreneur Jeffrey Raider has observed the brand revolution from a front-row seat. He started not one  but two  direct-to-consumer unicorns before he reached his mid-30s. He co-founded Harry’s in 2013 and sold it to Edgewell for $1.37 billion six years later. Earlier  he had co-founded Warby Parker  which is worth $1.75 billion. Harry’s and Warby Parker  along with Dollar Shave Club and many of the other new successful direct-to-consumer brands  share a strategy: Each saw an opening to challenge entrenched market leaders with quality products at a much lower price. In Raider’s view  however  what catapulted each to become a billion-dollar brand is an obsession with connecting with the customer. Everyone who joins the staff of Harry’s  no matter what the job  has to spend a day working in the call center as part of the customer experience team. Raider and his co-founder  Andy Katz-Mayﬁeld  themselves spend several hours each month listening to customers’ complaints or suggestions. Among these was an odd inquiry that they heard from about 100 customers in Harry’s ﬁrst year. “People were calling us all the time  saying  ‘Hey  can I get one of those little plastic covers that go over the blade?’” Raider recalled. “And we’re like  why?” From the start  Harry’s had included a blade cover — a small  rigid plastic piece that snaps snugly over the razor cartridge — when it shipped a customer’s ﬁrst order  to protect the blade from getting dull. Many people threw the cover out or lost it  only to decide later that it might have been nice to use while traveling  not just to shield the blade but also to protect their ﬁngers from getting nicked when they reached into their toiletry kit. “Since I travel a lot  and the razor goes into my travel kit  I would like to get another. I don’t need another handle/blade set. Is the blade guard alone available?” one customer wrote in an email. So  in 2015  Harry’s began selling a replacement Travel Blade Cover for $1. It may seem insigniﬁcant  and indeed it brings in only a tiny amount of revenue  but Raider points to it as something that signals to customers that Harry’s cares about what they have to say. And that helps to build loyalty that will last for a long time  which is one of the things that makes for a successful and enduring brand. Yet Raider understands that the proliferation of start-up brands has fragmented the consumer product business  and that could make it harder than ever to create mass brands in the mold of Serta or Victoria’s Secret or Gillette. In the old world  once a popular mass-market brand was established  it could count on a long reign. In the new world  this is no longer true. Brand loyalty is declining as never before. One report on the 100 top consumer product brands found that 90 percent had lost market share in recent years. The decline in brand loyalty  of course  has helped power the rise of the new direct-to-consumer brands This development hasn’t gone unnoticed by Neil Blumenthal  another founder of Warby Parker. “It’s never been cheaper to start a business  although I think it’s never been harder to scale a business ” he says. Warby Parker is the most prominent new eyewear brand  but its market share is still less than 5 percent. And in the years since it sold its ﬁrst pair of eyeglasses  in 2010  other start-ups have launched well over a dozen new online eyeglass brands. Many of the newcomers are copycats with essentially the same business model as Warby Parker  but others are niche players  such as Lensabl  which will make prescription lenses for your frames so you don’t have to buy new ones — “Our Lenses  Your Specs” — or Pixel  which sells eyeglasses with a pigment in the lenses  so they ﬁlter out “blue light” from computer screens  which can cause eye strain  or Topology  which makes frames custom-ﬁtted to your face using an iPhone’s 3-D scan technology. How many of these start-ups will succeed? To some  the constant inﬂux of new entrants offering eyeglasses and other products underscores that the direct-to-consumer frenzy has elements of a bubble — much like the dot-com boom of the 1990s  with venture capital ﬁrms ﬁnancing rival brands that are chasing the same customers. But while not all will survive  it’s possible that many will. The good news for brands  new and old  is that the market for consumer products isn’t just tens of billions or even hundreds of billions of dollars a year  but several trillion dollars a year in the United States alone.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/automobiles/nissan-carlos-ghosn-strategy.html,Nissan Is in Trouble. Carlos Ghosn May Deserve the Blame. Advertisement Supported by The embattled executive says he left the automaker in good shape. But industry experts and U.S. dealers blame his strategy for its current troubles. None None None None None None Analysts and industry executives lay much of the blame for Nissan’s woes on Mr. Ghosn. Over his last eight years at the helm  he led an unrelenting push for growth  often at the expense of the bottom line. To satisfy his demands for higher sales and more market share  Nissan executives turned to questionable practices that alienated a critical constituency: the dealers who sell its cars. “Almost nobody calls now and says  ‘I want to buy a Nissan franchise ’” said Alan Haig  president of Haig Partners  which advises buyers and sellers of auto dealerships. “Carlos pushed too hard. He had very ambitious goals  and he pushed his managers to achieve them. He created a temporary situation that looked good for a while  but it was artificial.” In an interview last week in Beirut  Mr. Ghosn said Nissan was doing fine when he stepped aside as chief executive three years ago  and he blamed his successor  Hiroto Saikawa  for the company’s problems.  “I think he’s unfit to be C.E.O.  particularly when he spent this time not taking responsibility for the situation in which the company was ” Mr. Ghosn said.  Travis Parman  a spokesman for Nissan’s North American division  declined to comment on Mr. Ghosn’s remarks  but acknowledged that a strategy of “volume at any cost” had sometimes driven “bad behavior” by the company. Asked Tuesday to address whether flaws in Nissan’s United States strategy under Mr. Ghosn laid the groundwork for its recent troubles and alienated dealers  someone in contact with him said the former chief executive “strongly rejects” the premise. Sales for Nissan’s two brands in the United States rose with the economic recovery  but failed to sustain their gains. U.S. AUTO SALES 1.5 million vehicles Nissan Infiniti 1.0 0.5 0 ’09 ’11 ’13 ’15 ’17 ’19 U.S. MARKET SHARE 10 % Nissan 8 6.6 7.2 6 4 2 Infiniti 0.8 0.7 0 ’09 ’11 ’13 ’15 ’17 ’19 U.S. MARKET SHARE U.S. AUTO SALES 1.5 million vehicles 10 % Nissan Infiniti Nissan 8 6.6 1.0 7.2 6 4 0.5 2 Infiniti 0.8 0.7 0 0 ’09 ’11 ’13 ’15 ’17 ’19 ’09 ’11 ’13 ’15 ’17 ’19 Source: Autodata By The New York Times None None In 2011  as the industry was recovering from the deep recession of 2008 and 2009  Mr. Ghosn stood before hundreds of reporters in Yokohama and announced an ambitious plan for Nissan. Over the next eight years  he said  Nissan would raise its share of the global market to 8 percent  from 5.8 percent. He planned to do this by investing heavily in the emerging markets of Brazil  Russia  India and China. The United States market  where the economic recovery promised several years of rising auto sales  had a special role. There  he promised  Nissan’s market share  including the Infiniti luxury brand  would rise to 10 percent by 2017. To drive growth  Nissan introduced new models and aggressive incentives that imposed ambitious sales quotas and tough terms on dealers. The incentive scheme Nissan favored  known as a stair step  awards cash bonuses to dealers as opposed to the more familiar rebates given to buyers. But it was essentially an all-or-nothing deal: Dealers got substantial bonuses only if they hit sales goals.  “We made tremendous profit at the beginning ” said Mr. Smith  the Georgia dealer. “But as your target went up and up year after year  you reached a point where you can’t hit the target.” Dealers often sold cars at fire-sale prices in the last days of the month to make it over the line. That irritated customers when they learned that a neighbor paid thousands of dollars less for the same car  some dealers said. Other dealers simply bought cars themselves  held them for a few months and then offered them as used cars. None “Nissan was convinced that stair steps were the way to go  and we did not agree with this strategy for our business ” said Marc Cannon  an AutoNation spokesman. It didn’t help that Americans were gravitating strongly toward trucks and sport utility vehicles — which produce bigger profits — and away from sedans and compacts  which Nissan relies on for a large portion of sales. With the deadline for Mr. Ghosn’s goal of 10 percent market share a few years away  Nissan’s United States executives increasingly took aim at smaller dealers  imposing ever more demanding terms to ramp up sales. Inside Nissan  the effort was known as “Grow or Go.” The company also began favoring a few large dealers  quietly agreeing to provide funding to them that was not offered to others nearby. In Coral Gables  Fla.  Bernie Moreno had a confidential agreement calling for Nissan to pay him $4.4 million over several years to fund an opulent Infiniti dealership  he said. Nissan also agreed to give him $6.5 million more for two new Nissan dealerships he opened near Cleveland. Even with extra money from Nissan  Mr. Moreno eventually struggled. One month in 2018  Nissan raised the sales goal of his Infiniti store to 180 cars — about twice as many as it would naturally sell. “It was an impossible number ” he said. The type of stair-step programs Nissan operated “were like heroin ” Mr. Moreno added. “They gave car companies an immediate boost in sales  but then they couldn’t get off it.” In 2017  Mr. Ghosn’s final year as chief executive  Nissan sold 1.6 million cars and trucks in the United States  a 53 percent increase from 2011  and enough to give it 9.2 percent of the market  short of Mr. Ghosn’s target. But the incentives it was paying out were starting to eat into profits  and many of its remaining dealers were fed up with chasing higher sales year after year.  Nissan’s most recent earnings report revealed the depth of its troubles. While China has become Nissan’s biggest market  Mr. Ghosn’s push into emerging markets has become a costly flop amid economic turmoil in Brazil  India and Russia. In the United States  Nissan has been slow to introduce new models  leaving little to draw shoppers. When Mr. Ghosn’s successor  Mr. Saikawa  finally changed the company’s incentive strategy in 2018  sales slumped  and Nissan was left with a glut of unsold cars. Without the old incentive scheme  Nissan dealers stopped offering bargain prices every month. “Customers had become trained to shop for the deal ” Mr. Smith said.  In the six-month period ending Sept. 30  Nissan’s operating income fell 85 percent from the same period a year before. In North America  profit declined 57 percent.  None For all Nissan’s troubles  Mr. Smith is determined to continue as a dealer. He said a turnaround would take time  but added  “I’m optimistic.” Mr. Moreno  on the other hand  is giving up on selling cars  in large part because of his experience with Nissan. Over the past year  he has sold his two Nissan stores in Ohio and about a dozen dealerships of other brands. A deal to sell Infiniti of Coral Gables and a Buick GMC dealership in Ohio is expected to close in a few weeks  he said. “Then I’ll be out of the auto business completely ” he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/realestate/12mort.html,A Downside of Short Sales Advertisement Supported by Mortgages None None None Fraudulent short sales take many forms  but Frank McKenna  the vice president for fraud strategy at CoreLogic and one of the report’s authors  says one arrangement is more common than others. An agent for the borrower negotiates with the lender to obtain a low selling price for a property  then sells it to a “straw buyer ” or someone with whom the agent is affiliated. The agents are sometimes real estate agents  or employees of businesses that advertise as “foreclosure rescue” specialists  Mr. McKenna said. As the agent negotiates with the lender  and unbeknownst to the original homeowner or the lender  the agent arranges to resell the property at a higher price. The new buyers may not know that they could have obtained the property for a lower price. Or  even worse  they may be victims of identity theft  unaware that their financial information was being used to buy a home. In other fraudulent transactions  a borrower might purposefully default on a mortgage he or she could actually afford. The borrower arranges to transfer the property to a friend or relative through a short sale  and the original borrower can remain in the home. The new owner can also transfer ownership back to the original owner through a quitclaim deed  Mr. McKenna said. He estimated that only about 2 percent of the short sales completed in the last two years were fraudulent  but said fraud was becoming more frequent. “It’s happening a lot more in this market because there are so many more short sales ” he said. “There’s more opportunity to go after the quick buck.” CoreLogic does not track the actual number of fraudulent short sales. Rather  it estimates the figure by identifying short-sale transactions in which the house was quickly sold or “flipped” to a new buyer  or resold for a vastly higher price. The company obtains and analyzes publicly available sales and financial information on most of the nation’s home purchases. Florida  California  Texas and Arizona had the greatest number of suspicious short sales  according to the CoreLogic report. New York ranked fifth  with roughly 5.5 percent of all short sales falling into the “suspicious” category. New Jersey ranked eighth  with about 3.3 percent of short sales categorized as suspicious. In Connecticut  the percentage of suspicious short sales was close to zero.Mr. McKenna said the rising number of suspicious short sales could undermine the use of these transactions as a foreclosure alternative. That  he said  would be unfortunate  since borrowers and lenders have only recently reported some momentum in successfully completing short sales. But John P. Bonora  a vice president of the Fairfield County Bank in Ridgefield  Conn.  said he did not expect this to happen. Noting that CoreLogic also sells fraud prevention services to lenders  Mr. Bonora theorized that its report might overstate the threat of fraudulent short sales. “I’d forward the report to my folks and say you should have some of these things in the back of your mind ” he said. “But I don’t think this report would deter us from doing a short sale.” Still  Mr. Bonora said  the report makes him more suspicious of real estate agents who market themselves as foreclosure specialists.  “They’re probably speaking with borrowers on a daily basis about foreclosures ” he said. “And people are opportunists.” Advertisement ,articles/business

https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/style/tmagazine/air-supply.html,"Air Supply Advertisement Supported by None Among other enticements  it was spices that sent Christopher Columbus sailing west and da Gama around the Cape of Good Hope. And it is spices and other exotic  hard-to-come-by ingredients that make the contemporary restaurant kitchen the center of its own global economy. Ludovic Lefebvre  who recently replaced his fellow Frenchman Alain Giraud as the chef at Bastide  the tony haute-cuisine retreat in Los Angeles  sees the merits of outsourcing. His appetite for the new has transformed the menu from dishes rooted in the flavors of Provence to a more picaresque cuisine  worldwide in its influences. To find novel flavors for Bastide's clientele  Lefebvre leans on his favorite purveyors  like Jing Tio  the owner of the Santa Monica food boutique Le Sanctuaire. ""I push him to find unusual ingredients "" he says. Tio has helped him to discover the flavors of Australia  from the pure lemon scent of lemon myrtle to the roasted-coffee aroma of wattleseed  which comes from a variety of acacia. Not everything Lefebvre cooks with comes from far-flung spots: he works in California  after all  the cradle of the local-foods movement. With the help of a produce forager (a chef's answer to a personal shopper)  Lefebvre can get most of his staples -- herbs  onions  lemons  carrots and the like -- straight from the Santa Monica farmer's market  where growers from Salinas to San Diego gather every Wednesday. But when it comes to sexy showcase ingredients  Lefebvre isn't limited to what can be grown in terra cognita. Like many chefs  he is reliant on a seamless international chain of food transport for chanterelles gathered by foragers in Saskatchewan  Indian cumin  and milk-fed veal raised near Scranton  Pa. To get a sense of just how much diners have come to rely on well-traveled ingredients for their eating pleasure  we have tallied the total number of miles traveled by the ones in a single veal entrée at Bastide. The distance -- 66 584 miles -- is well over two trips around the equator. SARA DICKERMAN Advertisement ",articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/business/economy/marriage-and-the-law-of-supply-and-demand.html,Supply  Demand and Marriage Advertisement Supported by Economic View None IN some cultures  romance isn’t nearly as important as cash when it comes to choosing a marriage partner. And even when money plays no explicit role in selecting a mate  courtship customs are governed by the venerable economic model of supply and demand.  Under the dowry system in India  for example  parents of older brides would typically pay more to prospective grooms. Men with better jobs would receive larger payments  too. In short  there really is a marriage market in many countries around the world  and economic principles apply to it. In markets with a preponderance of women seeking partners  the terms of trade shift in favor of men. If more men are seeking partners  the reverse is true. Two cases in point are the baby-boom generation in the United States and the current youth cohort in China. In the United States  the end of World War II and the return of millions of troops set off the baby boom. In the second half of the 1940s  the population swelled by almost 14 percent  versus growth of less than half of 1 percent during the first half of the decade. By the mid-1960s  many of those babies were reaching the traditional marriage age. At the time  it was American custom for women to marry men several years older than themselves. In a typical wedding in 1969  for example  the bride might have been born in 1947 and the groom in 1943. Because of that custom  women at the leading edge of the baby boom confronted a significant shortfall of potential marriage partners. Economics teaches us that when there is excess demand for a good  its price rises. According to this model  excess demand for grooms should have caused the terms of courtship to shift in favor of men.  Before the 1960s  cultural norms encouraged celibacy before marriage. The breakdown of those norms has been widely attributed to the introduction of oral contraception  which gave women an unintrusive way to protect themselves against an unwanted pregnancy. The pill no doubt played a role — perhaps a very big one — but skeptics object that effective alternative forms of contraception had long since been available. The supply-and-demand model bolsters the skeptics’ concerns. Biologists describe a fundamental asymmetry in the sexual strategies favored by males and females in vertebrate species. Males  whose sex cells are cheap to produce  tend to favor more transient sexual relationships  whereas females  for whom pregnancy and birth are far more costly  tend to favor greater commitment. The sexual revolution  which bent cultural norms toward male preferences  may thus be partly explained by the excess demand for grooms in the 1960s. None According to market models  the terms of trade in the Chinese marriage market should have shifted sharply in favor of women. And evidence suggests that young Chinese women and their families have in fact become much more selective in recent years. They appear  for example  to focus more critically on the earnings potential of prospective mates. Because house size is often assumed to be a reliable signal of wealth  a family can enhance its son’s marriage prospects by spending a larger fraction of its income on housing. (Other families can follow the same strategy  of course  but when all families do so  the resulting homes are still reliable indicators of relative wealth.) Such a shift appears to have occurred. None Mr. Wei reports that many families with sons have begun to add a phantom third story to their homes  one that looks normal from the outside but whose interior space remains completely unfinished. “Marriage brokers are familiar with the tactic ” he reports  “yet many refuse to schedule meetings with a family’s son unless the family house has three stories.” Risk-taking among men is another marker of the terms of trade in marriage markets. Biologists have long argued that men’s relative willingness to engage in risk is an evolutionary legacy of polygynous mating systems  those in which males with the most resources took more than one mate. That means males with the least resources were left with none — the worst thing that could happen in Darwinian terms.  Fast-forward to humans today  and we can see why men may view financial risk-taking as a compelling strategy. Let’s say a man who is single has a chance to invest his last $10 000 in a very risky business venture. If it succeeds  he gets $1 million and is much more successful socially in finding mates.  So even if the odds of success are small  it would be rational — in Darwinian terms — for him to make the investment  because he would fail for sure if he doesn’t. How is this showing up in China? Mr. Wei and Mr. Zhang find evidence that men are more likely to make risky financial investments in cities with higher male-to-female ratios. Their specific finding was that significantly more local businesses are started in such cities. This doesn’t appear attributable to other factors  since cities’ sex ratios seem to have no effect on the number of businesses started by foreigners.  The choice of a marriage partner is one of the most important decisions in life. It’s clearly very different from choosing a car. Yet in many ways  it appears to obey a strikingly similar market logic.  Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/opinion/09chait.html,Captives of the Supply Side Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None Washington REMEMBER the Republican presidential debate a few months ago  when three candidates raised their hands to indicate they didn’t believe in evolution? Something just as laughable is likely to happen today  at the first Republican debate on the economy. Every candidate will probably embrace the myth that cutting taxes increases government revenues. At the very least  no one will denounce it as a falsehood. It’s been said for years that the Republican nominating process is controlled by social conservatives  and that any aspiring nominee must kowtow to their demands. But this year’s Republican primary is making it increasingly clear that a different tiny minority — the economic far right — truly calls the shots. Last year  Senator John McCain earned widespread ridicule for publicly embracing Jerry Falwell  whom he had once described as “evil.” But an equally breathtaking turnabout occurred earlier in the year  when Mr. McCain embraced the Bush tax cuts he had once denounced as an unaffordable giveaway to the rich. In an interview with National Review  Mr. McCain justified his reversal by saying  “Tax cuts  starting with Kennedy  as we all know  increase revenues.” It was the political equivalent of Galileo conceding that the Sun does indeed revolve around the Earth. Mr. McCain is not alone. Every major Republican contender — Rudy Giuliani  Fred Thompson  Mitt Romney — has said that the Bush tax cuts have caused government revenues to rise. No prominent Republican office-seeker dare challenge this dogma for fear of offending the economic far right. Yet there is no more debate about this question among economists than there is debate about the existence of evolution among biologists. Most economists believe that it is theoretically possible for tax rates to be high enough that a reduction in rates could actually produce more revenues. But I do not know of any tenured economist in the United States who believes this is true of the Bush tax cuts.  Granted  economic growth sometimes causes revenues to rise faster than expected after a tax cut  as has happened since the 2003 tax cut. But sometimes revenues fall faster than expected after a tax cut  as they did after the 2001 tax cut. And sometimes revenues rise faster than expected after a tax increase  as they did after the 1993 Clinton tax increase. Even very conservative economists who have worked for the Bush administration — including Greg Mankiw  a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bush who is now an adviser to Mr. Romney — have publicly stated that today’s tax revenues would be even higher were it not for the Bush tax cuts. No Republican candidate can risk committing heresy by acknowledging this bipartisan consensus among economists. On social issues  however  Republicans actually tolerate diversity of thought. For example  Mr. McCain  Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Thompson all oppose  on federalist grounds  a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. The Republican Party is organized around a strategy of building political capital on social issues while spending political capital on economic issues. Republicans will advance the social conservative agenda  but they will rarely risk their popularity to do so. As Trent Lott  the former Senate majority leader  recently observed: “Republicans tend to squabble  but when it’s fiscal issues  when it’s economic issues  we tend to come together. That’s what makes us Republicans.” Mr. Lott is right if he’s referring to the members of the Washington establishment who run the Republican Party. But when it comes to the party’s rank-and-file members  he has it exactly backward. Grassroots Republicans agree on social issues but disagree on economics.  The most recent Pew survey of the electorate  which came out two years ago  revealed that Republicans find common ground on social issues like discouraging homosexuality and teaching creationism alongside evolution in the public schools. They disagree on economic policy. In the survey  most members of the Republican coalition preferred deficit reduction to tax cuts.  Ardent anti-tax conservatives represent a clear minority among Republican voters. And yet the most extreme and counterfactual subgroup among them — supply-siders — remain firmly in control of the party.  The party’s economic priorities are reinforced at Grover Norquist’s weekly “Wednesday Group” meetings  where conservative activists  politicians  business lobbyists and pundits meet to hash out a common agenda. Mr. Norquist is known to cut off any mention of issues like abortion or homosexuality with a curt “No sex talk  please.” A handful of fanatical ideologues  along with a somewhat larger number of money men who stand to gain a fortune from supply-side policies  relentlessly enforce the faith. They do so with far more success than the religious right  and they receive far less mockery for their efforts. Just last month President Bush insisted  yet again  that “supply-side economics yields additional tax revenues.” Hardly an eyebrow was raised. Advertisement ,articles/business

Brian Cowan  the Health Minister  announced a Solomonic solution last week: Irish men in need could get free Viagra  but only four pills a month. The limit was set ''to reduce the possibility of inappropriate usage '' Mr. Cowan told reporters. (No special provisions were announced for months with five Saturday nights.)

https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/29/opinion/supplying-the-enemy.html,Supplying the Enemy Advertisement Supported by Whatever one may think of Russia's political opposition to the war in Iraq  no one denies Moscow's right to it. Supplying arms to Iraq is something else. Not only is this a clear violation of U.N. sanctions  but Russia has weapons that pose a lethal threat to U.S. and British soldiers. Those are exactly the kinds of weapons that the Bush administration has accused Russia -- and now Syria -- of supplying Iraq. Whether President Vladimir Putin chooses to acknowledge the sales or not  he would be well advised to make sure they are stopped right now. U.S. officials say they have been pressuring Russia for many months now to end sales of three types of equipment: night vision goggles  antitank missiles and equipment that can jam global positioning systems  used to guide ''smart'' weapons. The ability to fight at night is one of the coalition's strengths  the Russian missiles can knock out the mighty Abrams tank  and smart weapons can be sent astray with the jamming device. These things may have already been used to deadly purpose. Yesterday  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld also said Syria was shipping such equipment into Iraq  although the Pentagon says it does not know if that  too  is Russian in origin. The Russian government and the firms that manufacture this equipment have denied providing any of it to Iraq. But the White House has been quite specific in its allegations  and even the Russian press has suggested that the charges are not without substance. Perhaps the Kremlin is technically correct  and the arms are being smuggled out by old-guard military officers or impoverished military enterprises  or they are reaching Iraq through intermediaries and third countries. These are sadly familiar routes for arms sales by former Soviet states and satellites. It is also possible that Mr. Putin has legitimate grievances against Washington. He made sincere efforts to forge a partnership with President Bush  including extensive support in the war on terrorism  but ended up swallowing some tough political pills with little to show for it. So Mr. Putin may have decided to draw the line on Iraq. Russia has substantial interests in Iraq  including a huge unpaid debt for past arms sales and lost contracts in Iraqi oil fields. If Moscow had been promised some way to recoup  Mr. Putin may not have thrown in his lot so ardently with France and Germany. None of that  however  justifies providing Iraqis with means of killing Americans. This goes beyond political calculation  and beyond pique. Mr. Putin must understand that if Russian arms are reaching Iraq by any route  and are putting American men and women in harm's way  it is simply not enough to declare that he is not responsible  or to pretend it is not happening. Many Americans may share the Russian objections to this war  but no Americans will tolerate or forgive having an American tank blown up by a Russian missile. Advertisement ,articles/business

Lee’s inspires such fantasies. The other day  a woman shopping for her 10-year-old granddaughter caught the attention of Christopher James Glover  29  a sales clerk who studied at Pratt and who is an illustrator and comic artist in his own right. She wanted a rainbow’s worth of colored pencils. Mr. Glover counseled her to start simply  with white  canary yellow  crimson and a blue close to cyan.  None That Mr. Glover took 10 minutes to sell four pencils  and talked a customer out of spending more money  says a lot about Lee’s. First of all  it is a family business. Gilbert and Ruth Steinberg  husband and wife  bought the store in 1951  when it was across 57th Street in the Osborne Apartments  two doors down from the Art Students League. Mr. Steinberg was no stranger to the trade. His father had run New York Central Art Supply at Third Avenue and 13th Street  which is still in business and still in the family.  In 1975  the Steinbergs rented space in the former American Society of Civil Engineers headquarters  and Lee’s moved to its current location. This distinctive landmark  at 220 West 57th Street  with delicate French Renaissance flourishes  was once among the more elegant branches in the Schrafft’s restaurant chain. The Steinbergs bought the property in 1995  allowing them to greatly expand.  Gilbert Steinberg died in 2008  following his wife  who was known as Ricki  by six months. Two of their children  David Steinberg  51  and Jill Isaacs  57  now own and run Lee’s. None 11 Photos None The Art Students League is  as ever  a good source of customers.

The last word in lettering in the 1960s and ’70s was a product called Letraset: individual film-thin letters that could be rubbed off a sheet directly onto a poster or a layout. The painstaking process looked professional  and Letraset was the top-selling item at Lee’s. But these days you can do the same thing on a Mac in a few seconds. Art supplies are still the core of Lee’s business  however. And it’s no accident that the paints and brushes and canvas and stretchers and easels are arrayed in such inviting density  Mr. Basile said  adding  “People love a treasure hunt.” Advertisement ,articles/business
https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/02/business/big-oil-the-motives-supply-and-profits.html,BIG OIL: THE MOTIVES  Supply and Profits Advertisement Supported by BIG OIL: THE MOTIVES None For all the wealth of Exxon and Mobil -- and all the market power inherent in their announced merger -- these two oil giants are essentially purveyors of an ordinary commodity  and commodities are in huge supply. Their falling prices are cutting into profits everywhere and hurting national economies. The merger is essentially an attempt by Exxon and Mobil  particularly Mobil  to sustain profits. The two companies have been among the nation's most profitable  but the current price of crude oil  $11.13 a barrel  is barely enough to cover Exxon's exploration and production costs  and less than what Mobil spends to find and retrieve oil and natural gas. ''The cost reductions from this huge merger will come in many different areas '' said Victor Burk  chief of Arthur Andersen's Energy Services Group. ''Exxon and Mobil will combine their headquarters and back office operations  and their purchases of supplies and services. As the world's biggest company  their negotiating power will be greatly enhanced. And they will try to reduce Mobil's costs for finding and developing oil reserves  bringing them more in line with Exxon's.'' All that cost-cutting cuts two ways for ordinary Americans. Lower costs mean lower prices for gasoline  plastics and other petroleum-based products  reducing inflation. But the cost-cutting also means downsizing and lost incomes. Cost-cutting through mergers is hardly a new tactic. In the oil industry  BP Petroleum and Amoco have already taken this step  and so have Texaco and Shell. With oil prices unlikely to rise until Asian demand revives -- probably many months in the future -- other oil companies appear to be moving in the same direction. France's Total S.A. announced yesterday that it had acquired a 41 percent stake in Belgium's Petrofina S.A. The plunge in commodity prices goes beyond oil  and also beyond steel or textiles or livestock or grain or all the other basic materials that the word ''commodity'' brings to mind. Because of the collapse in Asian demand  an index of 28 of these standard commodities has fallen by 25 percent since last spring  a record drop. But in today's modern global economy  ''commodity'' also takes in numerous manufactured goods that are easily produced anywhere. Commercial airliners are not commodities. Two companies  Boeing and Airbus  control the key technologies and production skills. Highly technical medical devices are also exempt  their production limited to those companies and workers with the necessary know-how. But razors are a commodity  the very best easily copied and manufactured. Fabric is another example and so are apparel  lathes  computer chips  small appliances  toys  kitchen ware  television sets  watches and many other electronic devices. Commodities in this broader sense are in over-supply mainly because so many companies stepped up production in recent years  in the expectation that as supply rose  so would demand  absorbing the new supply. The Asian crisis destroyed that strategy  and now manufacturers find themselves unable to sell all they can produce. They are often forced to cut prices  hurting profits and forcing layoffs here and abroad as production has been cut back. ''The basic phenomenon  however you define the word commodities  is that there is a huge amount of slack capacity in most industries '' said Alan Blinder  a Princeton economist. Exxon and Mobil are caught in this squeeze. No American corporation was more profitable than Exxon last year  and Mobil was also among the top performers. The two giants are still reporting healthy profits. Their refining operations and gasoline marketing  for example  continue to prosper. What's more  says Mr. Burk  an Exxon-Mobil merger will give the new company much more influence in dealings with OPEC. ''In terms of production '' he said  ''it will be near in size to several of the big state-owned oil companies in the Middle East. It will have the means to finance very large exploration and development projects. And we may see Saudi Arabia and Kuwait  for example  opening their countries to foreign oil investment.'' But right now  in the basic business of exploring for oil  drilling the wells and recovering crude oil and natural gas  Exxon's and Mobil's costs are beginning to reach or surpass the basic price they get for even the best quality crude  known as West Texas Intermediate. Its price of $11.13 a barrel yesterday was down 41 percent from $18.83 last summer. Exxon  the stronger of the two companies  pumped from its American fields 204 million barrels out of its total worldwide production of 584 million barrels last year. The exploration and production costs averaged $7.11 a barrel  according to Arthur Andersen's Energy Services Group  which surveys oil industry costs  based on public disclosures. Outside the United States  the Exxon exploration and recovery cost was $10.39 a barrel -- a healthy margin last year  when crude oil rose above $20 a barrel for a while  but uncomfortably close to today's much lower price. Of the 250 million barrels of crude oil that Mobil pumped everywhere in the world last year  89 million came from American fields  at a cost of $14.85 a barrel in the United States for exploration and recovery  and $11.52 abroad. ''Mobil is not in good shape today in this category '' Mr. Burk said  ''and when you consider all the other costs involved in recovering crude oil  the cost for both companies is probably more than the current world oil price.''
