https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/movies/jurassic-park.html,‘Jurassic Park’: Where the Wild Things Are Advertisement Supported by your weekend watch with manohla and tony Our critics and readers make a return trip to the movie that kicked off a franchise. Does the blockbuster hold up in a summer without one? None None Set on a lush island  the park is the brainchild of John Hammond (Richard Attenborough)  a showman with a passion for spectacle and extinct reptiles. Spielberg  adapting Michael Crichton’s best seller  shared those enthusiasms as did the film’s original audience. The lifelike quality of the dinosaurs and the intensity of the action were big selling points 27 years ago and we wondered how they looked to our readers in light of today’s CGI-heavy blowouts. We also hoped readers would sink their teeth into some of the film’s meatier themes: the struggle between science and commerce  the tension between environmentalism and greed  the contrast between innocence and corruption  the debate between Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Sattler (Laura Dern) about having kids. And then there’s that dialectical puzzler  Steven Spielberg  the wunderkind turned empire-builder  who has long played the hero and the villain of modern Hollywood. None None Watching “Jurassic Park” on my little screen this time around  I was struck by how refreshingly un-grandiose it seemed  at least when compared with the ponderous apocalypticism of recent tentpoles. The moments of wonder  exposition and ethical chin-scratching are arranged around a series of action set pieces that are scary  scrappy and marvelously executed. Their effectiveness has less to do with the dinosaurs (cool as they are) than with Spielberg’s craft. He’s just so good at building suspense and pacing and cutting through a scene  providing jolts and giggles as he builds toward a big scare or a hairs-breadth escape. None This of course brings me to the most astonishing image in the film  which is of Jeff Goldblum’s injured “chaotician” (hoot!)  Dr. Malcolm  lying back with his black shirt unbuttoned to expose his lightly furred musculature. Consciously or not  Spielberg turns Goldblum into a sexualized spectacle  complete with dark shades and come-hither mien  a framing that seems dedicated to destroying a noxious ethnic stereotype. Goldblum has suggested in interviews that this great unbuttoning was spontaneous  but whether it is  the effect is the same. It’s as if Spielberg were saying  You want hot Jewish guys? I’ll give you hot Jewish guys! None None None None None None None Advertisement ,articles/movies

Let’s all Watch ‘Jurassic Park’ Advertisement Supported by your weekend watch with tony and manohla Does Steven Spielberg’s 1993 blockbuster  with its ravenous dinosaurs and scientist heroes  still satisfy our hunger for action? None None None That’s kind of funny  since on the evidence of “Jurassic Park ” they certainly don’t love us  except in the way that some moviegoers love Twizzlers. But the big lizards — or proto-birds  as Sam Neill’s paleontologist would insist — aren’t the bad guys. They’re female  for one thing  and are also simply acting according to the dictates of nature. They didn’t ask to be cloned back into existence as theme-park attractions. The malign forces at work here (spoiler alert!) are human greed and ambition  represented by the scheming lowlife IT whiz (Wayne Knight) and the idealistic showman (Richard Attenborough). And to some extent by Spielberg  too. “Jurassic Park” shakes a finger at voracious commercialism while another hand works the cash register. Depending on your view  that blatant contradiction is cynical or just part of the fun. The human cast definitely is. Samuel L. Jackson plays the chain-smoking theme-park tech guy. Jeff Goldblum  more reptilian than most of the dinos  is a smooth-talking “chaotician.” And then there is Laura Dern as a paleobotanist who adroitly smashes the girl-scientist stereotype (well  almost).

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/movies/nine-to-five-viewers.html,Punching the Clock (and the Boss) With Dolly  Lily and Jane Advertisement Supported by Your Weekend Watch With Tony and Manohla Our critics and readers ponder the workplace politics and current relevance of “Nine to Five.” None None None “Nine to Five” was also part of a boomlet of female-driven films that suggested change had come to the movies. None We chose “Nine to Five” as our latest Weekend Watch while The Times was in the middle of turmoil that led to a great deal of internal soul searching. I’d seen the film not long ago  and  despite its flat-footed direction  it seemed like an apt choice. But watching it again amid a national reckoning on race  all I could see — and think about — was how white (and straight) it is. It’s at once empowering and dispiriting  and less a call to revolution than another of the industry’s well-meaning liberal calls for playing nice with power. I love the leads  but still. “This wasn’t funny in 1980 and it isn’t funny now. If the three protagonists had been black  no one would be laughing. — Barbara A. Lee  NY (via email) None None Part of the fun of the movie is the way their characters refract their well-established public personas. Fonda plays the prim  sheltered Judy absolutely straight and with a fragile dignity that falls away to reveal her wit and toughness. Wit and toughness are the qualities that Tomlin leads with  but we also see how Violet’s confidence has been eroded by the steady poison of humiliation. Doralee starts out as the punchline to a joke — the joke that Parton would often disarm by telling on herself and then turning around. This is a fable of empowerment that is aware of real obstacles and limitations. Its credibility comes from the knowledge that the three stars  for all the power they may have achieved in Hollywood and Nashville  had been exploited  belittled and taken for granted  too. None None None None None Now  as many of us wonder if we’ll ever see the inside of an office again  we can recognize what has and hasn’t changed. None What annoyed me this time (and never before) was that Franklin Hart got away with his embezzlement. I am sick of white collar criminals and grifters and he is just one more! Brazil doesn’t seem like much punishment. Maybe if they sent him to the branch office in Siberia? Or how about if he just got caught and went to jail? — Leslie H.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/movies/some-like-it-hot.html,We Still Like It Hot Advertisement Supported by Your Weekend Watch With Tony and Manohla Zowie! Our critics and readers pondered the silliness and semiotics of “Some Like It Hot ” with Jack Lemmon  Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis  all in dresses and tottering heels. None None None The sexual politics might. Our readers had a lot of fun with Curtis and Lemmon dressed in 1920s women’s clothing  but they also had some issues — as did we. None None None None None None None Along these lines it’s worth pointing out that both this emblem of whiteness and this very white movie were created right in the middle of the civil rights movement. None In that company  “Some Like It Hot” looks like a bit of a throwback — in other ways too. There’s a pre-Code energy to its naughtiness  and the whiz-bang dialogue (by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond) sounds like a salute to classic screwball. If this movie had been made in the ’30s or ’40s  though  the cast would most likely have included a handful of black actors  playing Pullman porters  hotel workers and jazz musicians. Their absence can be taken as a sign of sensitivity  a move away from stereotypical  servile roles. I’m not saying those roles should have been there  only that Hollywood  not for the first or last time  found erasure to be the easiest solution to a problem of representation. I don’t think pointing this out spoils the fun. This is still a movie that makes me laugh out loud as few others do — a feeling shared by most of our readers. None None The whole movie feels like it was directed inside gigantic quotation marks. It’s a live-action cartoon with rat-a-tat guns and laughs  and gargoyle villains right out of Dick Tracy. Even Osgood’s signature “Zowie!” sounds like it should be in a comic-strip speech bubble. Some of the jokes are near-throwaways — like the “24 Hour Service” sign stuck in the window of a funeral parlor — but much of the humor is about who we are and who we’re supposed to be. The most brilliant stroke  of course  is Jerry-Daphne  who embraces his role as a “woman” so thoroughly that she becomes engaged to Osgood and who  after prodding from Joe (who gasses on about laws and conventions) needs to keep repeating “I’m a boy  I’m a boy” — oh  boy!

Advertisement Supported by Your Weekend Watch With Tony and Manohla In Billy Wilder’s 1959 winking comedy  Marilyn Monroe  starring alongside Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon  is at the height of her comedic powers. None “I’m tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop ” says Sugar “Kane” Kowalczyk  the ukulele player with a soft spot for saxophonists. A lot of us know how she feels. Everyone could use a little candy right now  and we can’t think of a sweeter way to spend time than with Sugar and her pals Jo and Daphne watching “Some Like It Hot.” Even if it’s your first encounter with this 1959 comedy — directed by Billy Wilder from a script that he wrote with I.A.L. Diamond — it spoils nothing to know that Jo and Daphne are really Joe and Jerry  and are played by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. Marilyn Monroe  at the height of her comedic powers  is Sugar  who sings “I Wanna Be Loved By You” (and she is) and whose walk Jerry likens to “Jell-O on springs.” None None None Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/movies/whats-up-doc-barbra-streisand.html,When Barbra Streisand and Ryan O’Neal Went Screwball Advertisement Supported by Your Weekend Watch With Tony and Manohla Our critics and readers packed up their plaid valises and fled the doldrums of the present for the loony-tune streets of San Francisco circa 1972 and “What’s Up  Doc?” None None Plentiful jokes  precision timing  memorable oddballs  kooky situations and beautifully executed physical comedy — “What’s Up  Doc?” has it all and more  including the blissful  counterintuitive pairing of Ryan O’Neal and Streisand. He plays Howard Bannister  a fusty music professor who  on a trip to San Francisco with his fiancée  Eunice Burns (Madeline Kahn)  meets Streisand’s Judy Maxwell  a zany  seemingly rootless sexpot. What Judy wants  Judy gets  and she’s soon chasing Howard amid escalating complications  slam-bam slapstick and some of the greatest second bananas ever bunched together. None None None None None None None None None Other readers cited lines that have become family in-jokes or catchphrases. The marvel of a script is credited to a dream team of New Hollywood screenwriters: Buck Henry  who had written “The Graduate ” and Robert Benton and David Newman  the credited authors of “Bonnie and Clyde.” And while we’re at it  we can’t scant the contributions of the editor  Verna Fields (who would go on to win an Oscar for “Jaws”) and the production designer  Polly Platt. The décor of Mr. Larrabee’s house — with those Lucite pillars and all that fancy modern sculpture — and the surreal rooms on the 17th floor of the Bristol Hotel may be the real stars of the picture. None All these years later and the most famous film of 1972 is the male-driven “The Godfather ” a film I revere but that also epitomizes the macho ethos of New Hollywood. It’s instructive that “What’s Up  Doc?” isn’t reflexively included in the 1970s pantheon  which is crowded with both male auteurs and brooding  violent and deeply serious male characters with a sprinkling of sad ladies à la Faye Dunaway in “Chinatown.” Genre prejudices also play a role in how “What’s Up  Doc?” has been (relatively) slighted  I imagine. Comedies rarely receive the kind of gaga critical sanction that dramas do  at least until the director is discovered by later generations  Hawks wasn’t a god of the art until cineastes like Bogdanovich anointed him. None None Once the action leaves the hotel  it switches gears from Howard Hawks to Buster Keaton  from zippy  door-slamming dialogue comedy (with a generous sprinkling of sight gags) to almost wordless sequences that are sidesplittingly crazy and insanely rigorous. The big car chase above all  thanks to the simple addition of a ladder and a pane of glass. None “What’s Up  Doc?” is a tribute to the classics of an earlier era that became a classic in its own right. When I was a kid  it seemed to be on television every other week  and I never got tired of tuning in. A lot of people  of all ages and dispositions  seem to feel the same way.

Let’s All Watch ‘What’s Up  Doc?’ Advertisement Supported by Your Weekend Watch With Tony and Manohla Does this 1972 farce — starring a madcap Barbra Streisand and a flustered Ryan O’Neal  and directed by Peter Bogdanovich — still have the screwball goods? None We’re feeling loopy and a little loony tunes under lockdown  and bet you are  too. We want to run around in the great outdoors  chase after a pizza-delivery guy and maybe throw a cream pie in someone’s face  all of which happens in the madcap comedy “What’s Up  Doc?” As light and ticklish as a cockatoo feather  Peter Bogdanovich’s ode to 1930s shenanigans is a guy-meets-gal story with pratfalls  silly jokes and perfectly timed slamming hotel doors. It doesn’t have a lot on its mind other than movie love and its own style — or does it? The dizzy story almost defies synopsis and involves spies and crooks and scholars and assorted identical red-plaid bags  all spinning like precariously balanced plates. At its core  though  there’s Ryan O’Neal as Howard Bannister  a sober  bespectacled music professor who arrives in San Francisco with his hilariously no-nonsense fiancée  Eunice Burns (a sublime Madeline Kahn in her feature debut). Their future and the film’s denouement is sealed the minute Judy Maxwell  an anarchic force played by Barbra Streisand  sets her sights on Howard. None None None Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/movies/do-the-right-thing-spike-lee.html,Why ‘Do the Right Thing’ Is Still a Great Movie Advertisement Supported by Your Weekend Watch With Tony and Manohla Our critics and readers chilled out watching Spike Lee  Rosie Perez and Danny Aiello heat up. And that’s the triple truth  Ruth. None None It’s part of the curriculum now: we received comments from high school students who watched it for class as well as remarks from some teachers. The students had a lot to say about Lee’s painful themes and arguments  which  among other things  dynamically put Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X into play. None None None None But I have to be honest: through most of this viewing what I was thinking about most was pizza. I miss pizza so much. None None The casting of high-profile civil rights veterans in a story about racial acrimony and injustice can be read as a critique of — or lament about — the promises and disappointments of an earlier activist era. But it’s also a great authorial stroke and just one of the many significant and signifying parts of a movie dense with ambivalence and cultural meanings. Here  every sneaker (Jordans)  sports jersey (Jackie Robinson  No. 42)  song on the radio (“Fight the Power”) and blast of color (“Afrocentric bright” as Lee once described it) is another tile in a larger cinematic mosaic. Put differently  Lee is a great filmmaker  and  as the filmmaker Ryan Fleck (“Captain Marvel”) reminded us in a comment  also an influential one: None None None None How does that happen? How does it keep happening? “Do the Right Thing” looks for the answer in the details of everyday life  which is full of accidents  potential flash points and micro (and not so micro) aggressions. It’s also full of tenderness  silliness  and small moments of sorrow and grace. None None None None None None Advertisement ,articles/movies

Advertisement Supported by Your Weekend Watch With Tony and Manohla Gather at the cool-out corner and speak your mind about Spike Lee’s 1989 portrait of a neighborhood — and country — on the boil. None None None Lee’s depiction of gentrification  police brutality  poverty and the mistrust and wary affection between black and white New Yorkers hasn’t dated  even if the city itself has changed in 30 years. But while “Do the Right Thing” remains a richly argumentative  debate-provoking  very American movie  it is more than the sum of its arguments. It is a showcase for Lee’s cinematic gifts  which don’t always receive their due  partly because critics tend to pay more attention to what he’s saying than how he’s saying it. The film is also a jewel box full of past  present and future stars: Ruby Dee  Rosie Perez  John Turturro  Giancarlo Esposito  Samuel L. Jackson  Danny Aiello  Bill Nunn  Martin Lawrence. You saw some of them here first. transcript Hello  everyone. This is Spike Lee  the producer  writer  director of ‘Do the Right Thing.’ This past June was the 30th anniversary of this film. I know the column is called ‘Anatomy of a Scene.’ I’m renaming this. I’m calling this ‘Anatomy of a Murder.’ The chokehold of Radio Raheem  played by the late  great Bill Nunn  my Morehouse brother— ”(SINGING) Fight the power. Fight the power. We’ve got to—” —was based upon the death of Michael Stewart. September 1983  Michael Stewart  a graffiti artist— he’s about as big as I am. 11 New York City transit police jumped on him and strangled our brother to death. That’s where I got the idea for the chokehold murder of Radio Raheem. And five years ago  Eric Garner died the same way that Radio Raheem did in a movie that was based upon the real life choke hold of Michael Stewart. So a lot of things in this film that even though it was written 31 years ago are still happening today. Black and brown people are still being murdered today by police forces across the United States of America  and the people who inflict this death walk free— don’t get fired  don’t get suspended. The film takes place one day  the hottest day of summer  in the People’s Republic of Brooklyn  New York. So tensions have risen all throughout the day. And the reason why it looks the way it is because the edict  the command  to Ernest  the DP  Wynn Thomas  the production designer  Ruth Carter  the costume designer— here’s what I told them. I said  look  I want people to be sweating in an air conditioning theater when they see this film. [CRASHES] And what we wanted to do is after he destroys the boombox  it’s quiet like the calm before a storm. Everybody’s like  what’s next? Everybody knows it gonna be bad. Everybody’s looking around— Radio Raheem. I mean  that was personal. It was like he got beat with the baseball bat because you’ve seen him the whole film with his boombox blasting Public Enemy’s ‘Fight the Power.’ We did not have a very good stunt coordinator  and people got hurt. Danny Aiello’s son  Danny Jr.  was his father’s double right here. This film was shot on one block in Bedford Stuyvesant. That one block got renamed ‘Do the Right Thing Way ’ the only street in the history of New York City named after a movie. [COMMOTION] Well  we gotta show that  number one  Sal’s Famous Pizzeria  is on the corner of the block directly opposite the Korean fruit and vegetable stand. So the fracas spilled out from Sal’s pizzeria to the street. So we had to show the block getting involved. “Fight!” “Mookie!” We wanted to start down and crane up so you could see the block. [COMMOTION] “Kill you! We’re gonna kill you  Sal!” And this becomes a brouhaha. Ozzie  trying to talk some sense— the love hate rings which is a homage to ‘Night of the Hunter.’ Robert Mitchum had them tattooed on his fingers. Now the cops come. Now we already have seen these two cops already. That’s Rick on the left— that’s Rick Aiello  Danny’s son. “Break it up! Break it up! Get off him! Get off him! Get out of the way!” And Sandoval play the other cop— Miguel Sandoval. Now you know if there’s a fight  who are they gonna grab? “You get over here!” [INTERPOSING VOICES] So this is a very hard scene to shoot. And for 31 years  it’s been a hard scene to watch. [INTERPOSING VOICES] “Just take him down  man.” “Goddammit  you’re killing him! You’re killing him!” “Give it up  asshole! Give it up!” This is the Michael Stewart chokehold. And when that Eric Garner thing happened  I put on my Instagram and Facebook with my editor  Barry Brown  and we cut back and forth between Radio Raheem and Eric Garner. And it’s the same thing. “Radio Raheem!” “Radio Raheem!” “No!” And then when he falls  we laid the camera down on the street so he would fall right into the lens. What does “Do the Right Thing” look like now? Does it still have the power to provoke? Does it make you angry and  if so  at what or whom? Are you struck by Lee’s fury or by his fondness for Brooklyn and its diverse inhabitants? If you haven’t seen the movie in a while  has your impression changed? And if you’re watching for the first time  does it live up to the hype? None We’re looking forward to a spirited  opinionated  enlightened viewing party. It might even get heated  so we’ll conclude by reminding everyone of something Spike Lee likes to say: “Spreading the love is the Brooklyn way.” Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/movies/honor-blackman-dead.html,Honor Blackman  a Memorable James Bond Adversary  Dies at 94 Advertisement Supported by In a long career she was best known for an early role: Pussy Galore  who declared herself immune to Agent 007’s charms before judo-flipping him. None Honor Blackman  an actress who achieved fame as a beautiful pilot with judo skills and a highly suggestive name in the 1964 James Bond movie “Goldfinger ” then went on to a long screen career in her native England and abroad  has died at her home in Lewes  in southeastern England. She was 94. Her family announced her death in a statement released to The Guardian in London on Monday. She was a breast cancer survivor  having undergone a lumpectomy in 2003. Ms. Blackman may have been unknown to American audiences when she played Pussy Galore opposite Sean Connery as the dashing secret agent James Bond  but she had already become a star in Britain on television. None It was only after Ms. Blackman left the series two years later that the show was exported to the United States  American viewers were introduced instead to her successor  Diana Rigg  as Mr. Macnee’s newest partner  Emma Peel. Ms. Blackman gave up “The Avengers” to take the role in “Goldfinger ” the third movie in the Bond series. In her late 30s when she made the film  she turned out to be one of the oldest “Bond girls” in the series  although she always objected to that term. “I consider Bond girls to be those ladies who took one look at Bond and fell on their backs ” Ms. Blackman told the website Cambridge News in 2012. Early on in “Goldfinger ” Ms. Galore declares to Bond  “I am immune to your charms” and judo-flips him into a haystack. (It turns out not to be a permanent immunity  however.) Honor Blackman was born on Aug. 22  1925  in London  the third of four children of Frederick Blackman  a civil-service statistician  and the former Edith Eliza Stokes. Her father was a crucial influence on her decision to pursue an acting career  she recalled. When she was a teenager  he gave her a choice of a bicycle or elocution lessons (he felt his own East London accent had held him back in life)  she chose the lessons. She later attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London and began performing onstage. Her first credited screen role was in “Daughter of Darkness” (1948)  a British crime film with horror elements  that came after she died in a horseback riding accident in an uncredited part in “Fame Is the Spur ” a 1947 movie starring Michael Redgrave. Before “Goldfinger ” she made dozens of appearances on British television and more than 20 feature films  among them “A Night to Remember” (1958)  Roy Ward Baker’s drama about the sinking of the Titanic  “The Square Peg” (1959)  a comedy with Norman Wisdom set during World War II  and “Jason and the Argonauts” (1963)  in which she played the goddess Hera. Ms. Blackman continued her screen acting career well into her 80s  including taking a small part as a glamorous party guest in “Bridget Jones’s Diary” (2001) and a recurring role on the classic British soap opera “Coronation Street” in 2004. None In later years  she played Henry Higgins’s mother in a national tour of “My Fair Lady” (2005) and Fraulein Schneider in the West End revival of “Cabaret” (2007). Ms. Blackman returned to the television spotlight in 1990 on “The Upper Hand ” a British version of “Who’s the Boss?” Her character (played by Katherine Helmond in the American version) was a glamorous  sexually eager grandmother  and she continued in the role for six seasons. Ms. Blackman had a singing career as well. She recorded “Kinky Boots” with her former co-star Mr. Macnee in 1964  although it became a hit only when it was rereleased in 1990. (Her “Avengers” character had a taste for thigh-high  spike-heeled black boots  but the later “Kinky Boots” film and stage musical were unrelated.) She released a new single  “The Star Who Fell From Grace ” in 2009  when she was in her 80s. Her final movie was the 2012 horror comedy “Cockneys vs. Zombies ” in which bank robbers unwittingly unleash an army of the living dead in East London. Her last screen role was in a 2015 episode of the British sitcom “You  Me & Them.” Ms. Blackman wed Bill Sankey  a businessman  in 1946  they divorced in 1954. She married Maurice Kaufmann  a British actor  in 1961  the couple had two children and divorced in 1975. She is survived by a daughter  Lottie Kaufmann  a son  Barnaby Kaufmann  and four grandchildren. Throughout her career  Ms. Blackman admitted to being painfully self-critical and sometimes blamed her father  because of his refusal to praise her for a job well done. But as the decades passed  she came to value his influence. “What he taught me has stood me in good stead ” she told the Australian newspaper The Courier-Mail in 2007. “Self-discipline  the ability to work and order my life come from him  and I’m grateful for that. What’s done is done  and you can’t bemoan the past.” Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/books/review/gillian-flynns-gone-girl-and-more.html,The Avengers Advertisement Supported by Crime None None On the occasion of this young couple’s fifth wedding anniversary  Nick tries to ignore the big questions weighing on his mind (“What have we done to each other? What will we do?”) and steels himself for the elaborate and humiliating treasure hunt his wife always makes of her gift presentation. But Nick’s brooding takes a darker turn when Amy disappears  amid signs of a struggle  from their house on the Mississippi River in North Carthage  Mo.  and he suffers the painful transformation from distressed husband to suspected murderer. Amy shares the narrative with Nick through giddy diary entries that date back to their first meeting at a party in Brooklyn and sharpen all the character traits blunted by five years of marriage. In those days  handsome  easygoing Nick wrote about pop culture for a men’s magazine  and beautiful  brainy Amy drew on her master’s degree in psychology to compose personality quizzes for the women’s market. But after losing their jobs in the publishing industry meltdown  Nick moved them to his backwater hometown and used the last of Amy’s trust fund to open a bar with his twin sister. Although he made a good case (“The world will always want a drink”)  Nick comes to regret detaching his urbane wife from her natural habitat. What makes Flynn so fearless a writer is the way she strips her characters of their pretenses and shows no mercy while they squirm. Nick would rather be arrested than reveal that he keeps old copies of his magazine articles hidden in a garage to read in secret  “like porn.” Amy would never give Nick the satisfaction of knowing that her treasure hunts are a cruel way of asserting her superior intelligence. Flynn dares the reader to figure out which instances of marital discord might flare into a homicidal rage. None Sure  the plot sounds ridiculous — but the characters have strong voices and bristle with funny quirks. (Pinscher collects porcelain figurines.) There’s even a high-minded social message at the end  when Terry identifies the murderer but refrains from branding him a serial killer: “There was a world of mad dogs like him  husbands and boyfriends who couldn’t contain their rage  whose hands had learned how to batter and strangle.” None Todd saves the narrative from turning into a home-front whodunit through adroit plot maneuvers that keep sending Bess back to the battlefield. Although the spy who loves her keeps watch on her reckless missions  such moments of grace are properly eclipsed by scenes of medics frantically ministering to the wounded  of doctors and nurses operating until they drop from exhaustion.

https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/fashion/20ALLRED.html,The Avenger Advertisement Supported by None ON a May morning in Los Angeles  a beautiful  somber brunette sat to the left of the lawyer who would present her case to a room full of about 75 reporters  photographers and camera people. “We are here today because another alleged victim of Roman Polanski’s sexual predatory conduct has come forward ” the lawyer explained  her face set in a familiar  concerned frown as the cameras whirred. “Charlotte Lewis  of London  England  who appeared in Roman Polanski’s film ‘Pirates ’ alleges that she was victimized by Mr. Polanksi when she was 16 years old.” For the lawyer  Gloria Allred  if not for her client  this was not an unusual morning. Over the past three decades  Ms. Allred’s face has appeared with remarkable regularity as — depending on one’s perspective — a feminist avenging crusader or a deluxe ambulance chaser catching a ride on the latest tabloid scandal. “Other victims should come forward to talk to law enforcement or to talk to me ” urged Ms. Allred  who was sitting atop a yellow-pages directory to make her 5-foot-2 frame more visible. None A quick trip through YouTube will also yield a Technicolor parade of other cases with which Ms. Allred has associated herself  including  most recently  that of Debrahlee Lorenzana — the nicely endowed woman with a penchant for fitted suits whose appearance seemed to upset her bosses at Citibank. None Mr. Polanski is under house arrest in Switzerland  waiting to see if he will be extradited to the United States over a 1977 sex-crimes case in which he was charged with raping a 13-year-old girl  he pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with a minor but fled the country before final sentencing. Ms. Lewis would later describe Ms. Allred as “a terrier ” explaining that she hoped to affect a judge’s ultimate sentencing of Mr. Polanski in that 1977 case with her own story of what she said happened to her in 1982. She decided to hire her after reading her 2006 book  “Fight Back and Win.” “I needed a strong advocate ” Ms. Lewis said. “I felt I needed an American attorney  and I wanted a female. I felt completely protected and safe with her sitting by my side.” Two weeks before that press conference  on a much quieter Los Angeles morning  Ms. Allred  who turns 69 next month  sat at the same extra-long table  impeccably turned out  as she seems always to be — this time in beige pants and a beige jacket  a silk scarf with splashes of red and black  gold earrings and a gold chain around her neck. Her short hair was neatly streaked and coiffed  her skin impressively youthful and her makeup careful and judicious. She is small and trim  though she does hardly any exercise. “Fighting injustice keeps you young ” she said. Ms. Allred’s definition of injustice is sweeping. At this point in time she is in the news for assisting Rachel Uchitel and Ms. Siwik-Daniels (perhaps better known as the adult-film star Joslyn James)  two of the many women who have emerged in the life of the prolific golfer Mr. Woods. “Whatever number you have read is probably right ” Ms. Allred said. (The National Enquirer reported 121). She also recently represented Vanessa Lopez in a suit against the basketball star Shaquille O’Neal  and accompanied Kate Gosselin’s brother  Kevin Kreider  and his wife  Jodi  as they testified during an emotional Pennsylvania legislative hearing on child-labor laws. But the overwhelming majority of cases handled by her 10-lawyer office  Allred  Maroko & Goldberg  involve workplace discrimination and wrongful termination  and Ms. Allred has handled many heart-wrenching cases that don’t make the tabloids. There is also no question that her high-profile work has helped to make it one of the most well-known litigation firms in the country. Michael Maroko  Ms. Allred’s law partner of 35 years  said he first noticed her in class at Loyola law school  she was the student who was always challenging the professor. “Whenever I go to a dinner party ” he said  “someone inevitably asks me  ‘Who is your P.R. person?’ ” He laughed. “We don’t have a P.R. person. In 35 years we’ve never paid one penny for P.R. Gloria just has an ability to handle the mishegas. She can face 150 cameras as cool as a cucumber.” If today it sometimes seems as though Ms. Allred is living in the nascent feminism of the 1970s  so  in a way  are many of her firm’s less visible clients: women (and men) who have been sexually harassed or fondled at work  girls who’ve been molested  or female prison inmates forced to wear handcuffs while delivering their babies. Those who support Ms. Allred argue that cases like those of Ms. Lorenzana and Citibank fit into this galaxy — but with tabloid glare  notoriety and guaranteed publicity thrown into the mix. Thane Rosenbaum  a novelist and law professor at Fordham University  sees Ms. Allred as what he calls “a moral attorney ” which he defines as someone who takes on a case without any thought for her own reputation or even whether she’s going to win or lose in the courtroom. “She represents people who we might not want to go to lunch with ” Mr. Rosenbaum said  “and she ruffles the feathers of people who think lawyers should confine themselves to the courtroom. She takes on issues that are too messy for the courtroom. Some people think it’s salacious  what she’s bringing into the public square. She’s in effect saying: ‘I move the ball out of this arena and take it into this arena. Being a quiet  demure woman will get this case nowhere.’ ” THE first thing to understand about Gloria Allred is that she does not care what you think about her relationship to media. If you search for any sense of embarrassment or shame  such as you might feel if your name were a late-night punch line for any joke regarding overly tenacious lawyering  you will not find it. It doesn’t exist. Her relationship to media is like Oprah Winfrey’s to money. It is uncomplicated  and you are free to project onto it whatever you like. None Whatever your response to her style  it is indisputable that Ms. Allred has carved a place for herself in popular culture. Her name popped up in an April “Saturday Night Live” sketch involving a high-school student  played by Justin Bieber  who warns his amorous teacher  played by Tina Fey  that he’s “going to call Gloria Allred.” In the current issue of Harper’s Bazaar  Ms. Allred is photographed dressed in armor as a modern-day Joan of Arc. Rather like another high-profile lawyer  Marvin Mitchelson  who died in 2004 and who tried a range of traditional cases before becoming known as “the king of palimony ” Ms. Allred handles many worthy cases that never see the light of the flashbulb  but she has a singular knack for seizing the ones that bring the press in droves. Emily Bazelon  a senior editor at Slate.com and a former editor of the Yale Law Journal  said that “some of her causes are incredibly worthy  but her way of going about it makes me cringe.” “I think it’s largely a good thing for women that they are more reticent about self-promotion ” she added  “but I also know that women sometimes can come out behind because of it. And if a man behaved as Ms. Allred does  he would not be called shrill  as I know she often is. So I think there’s some gender stereotyping going on there.” None She put on her do-not-mess-with-me face. “It is very frightening to feel alone when you are standing against a rich and powerful person and all his attendant helpers ” she said. “It’s dangerous out there. It’s the Wild West. People come to me to tell them how to manage the maelstrom. And the defense” — here she allows herself a little smile — “the defense just hopes the woman doesn’t hire Gloria Allred.” ON a recent spring Saturday  Ms. Allred was wearing a classic fuchsia St. John pantsuit as she greeted me at her weekend place in Malibu  Calif. The house  which came furnished when she bought it eight months ago  is one of those spaces that  when you step inside  makes you feel as if you are floating on the ocean  which in fact can be seen out every window. She has added very little to her new home  which includes bedrooms for her daughter and two grandchildren  aside from family photos and a painting or two. The open kitchen looked little used  Ms. Allred confirmed that suspicion. She did take cooking classes when she was married to her second husband  the former lawyer William Allred  but those days are long gone. They divorced in 1987 after 19 years of marriage  and she will never remarry  she said. “I’m not interested in dating. I like being with my own best friend  me. Certain women  particularly older women  cannot believe I like going to a social event by myself. But I do.” Ms. Allred’s daughter  Lisa Bloom  joined us for lunch at a restaurant up the street from her mother’s home. She is attractive  fit  vegan. Like her mother  she is a lawyer who frequently represents clients whose lives intersect with the famous. At the moment  she is representing Lindsay Lohan’s father  Michael Lohan  who is trying to force the actress into a drug-treatment center. I pointed out that mother and daughter  who are very close (Ms. Bloom worked in her mother’s firm for nine years)  resemble each other. “I wish I looked like that ” Ms. Allred said  gazing at her daughter with a smile. “Look at her!” Ms. Bloom was explaining her mother’s worldview. “She is deeply offended when someone in power takes advantage of a woman ” she said. Her mother joined in: “My work is not about popularity contests. It’s not even about justice. Justice would be that they had never been raped. Or abused or fired.” This seemed like a good moment to bring up the subject of a three-point calamity that shaped the young Ms. Allred. She was a divorced single mother by age 21  left without child support. At 25  when she was working as a teacher at Jordan High School in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles  she was raped while on vacation in Mexico. As a result  she underwent an illegal abortion that landed her in an intensive-care unit  where  while almost bleeding to death  a nurse told her  “This will teach you a lesson.” “I originally thought it was my own bad luck ” Ms. Allred said  as her daughter poked her fork at her salad and kept an eye on her mother’s face. “Eventually I figured out there was something systematic in the way women are treated.” Ms. Allred returned to the subject of her work: “Some women fought very hard to get us our rights. They were vilified at every turn. So now we are here to reinforce those rights  to protect those rights. Women can’t enjoy equal opportunity if they are sexually harassed at work.” Ms. Allred had earlier spoken of some of her more prominent cases  including a successful suit against the New York Friars Club for excluding women  and a complaint against Pasadena Superior Court Judge Gilbert Alston  who had dismissed a rape-and-robbery case in which the victim was a prostitute because  he said  “the law was set up to protect good people” — not “a street-walking prostitute.” The judge  who has since died  also said  “This case shouldn’t have been filed ” and further clarified his position for a Pasadena newspaper  saying  “A whore is a whore is a whore.” (The Commission on Judicial Performance notified Ms. Allred that “it had taken appropriate corrective action” against Judge Alston. But the rapist whom the judge did not jail went on to attack three more women.) IT probably came as no surprise to anyone that about a week after the Citibank story broke on Ms. Lorenzana — the tabloid favorite known as “bank babe” — Ms. Allred’s office issued a press release announcing that she would be acting as Ms. Lorenzana’s co-counsel. (Citibank has denied discriminating against Ms. Lorenzana.) As Ms. Lorenzana found herself in the eye of a media storm  she was represented by lawyers who did not make her feel confident. It was her boyfriend who came up with the idea of phoning Ms. Allred  and the two women met a few days later in New York. “I knew right away she was the person to represent me ” Ms. Lorenzana said in a telephone interview. “The media was attacking me for having surgical procedures. But that is a separate issue from my having a right not to be harassed at work. Gloria understood everything that I was feeling.” The hiring of Ms. Allred got a lot of press  not all of it good. Ms. Handler weighed in on her show again  this time with an extended skit lampooning the lawyer and her clients — but it was yet another reminder of why Ms. Allred has become such a go-to advocate for women caught up in a scandal: She apparently gets results. None Ms. Bloom went on to describe the backstage drama behind the press conference’s cancellation. “In all of my mother’s 30-some years in the law  I’ve never known her to cancel a press conference ” she said  perhaps not joking. She explained that her mother had been caught by paparazzi leaving the offices of Mr. Woods’s lawyers on a Monday and then caught again leaving Ms. Uchitel’s hotel two nights later. When Ms. Allred scheduled the news conference  she said  that was a signal that financial negotiations between the two parties had broken down  and when she canceled said conference  she was in effect making a tacit announcement that a settlement of some kind had been reached. Whether or not she plays out her cases in front of the cameras  Ms. Allred — who will not disclose compensation on cases like this but said that “most cases that we take are on a straight contingency” — sees media as part of the message. None As for her legacy  both legal and moral  Ms. Allred said that she is not much concerned about it. She was quick  though  to relate her Uncle Simon’s theory about how men tend to perceive her. “If a man feels good about the way he’s treated women in his life  he likes you ” she quoted him  laughing  “and if he doesn’t  he hates you.” Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/19/books/the-avenger.html,The Avenger Advertisement Supported by None TRAIN By Pete Dexter. 280 pp. New York: Doubleday. $24.95. ''No one interested in how newspaper reporters find their stories should imagine that the compass needle is reset each time out '' Pete Dexter once wrote. ''What they find attractive doesn't change  only where they find it.'' This goes for novelists as well  and particularly for Dexter  who in his five prior novels charted the effects of a decidedly American subset of violence -- in most cases  perversions of frontier justice -- in settings that ranged from the Wild West to a rowdy South Philadelphia neighborhood to the civil-rights-era Deep South. The narrative arc of a Dexter novel looks rather like a seismological map: an initial boom of violence foments other  repercussive booms  with the novels' suspense deriving not from the origins or causes of the first boom -- sometimes Dexter ignores these altogether -- but from the mystery of where the aftershocks will hit and who will be straddling the fault line when the earth cracks yet again. Because violence  for Dexter  is not so different from earthquakes  it's organic  erratic  inevitable  often seemingly random but sometimes truly random  with the power to merely shake you or to swallow you whole. And  like any natural calamity  it leaves little if any philosophic residue in its swath of debris. ''In the end '' the narrator of ''The Paperboy'' (1995) thinks to himself  ''we all know what we know.'' ''The experience itself  it was gone when it was gone '' and ''things were what they were '' Dexter concludes in ''Train '' his new novel  though a punch-drunk character sums it up for him more succinctly  and less tautologically: ''Sometime it happen.'' The best you can hope for  it seems  is not to be there when it do. In ''Train '' the effectual boom of violence begins 50 or so pages in  which is not to suggest that the novel starts out slowly  a crowbar attack  a foot chase ended by a broken leg  a mauling by a dog with a ''50-pound head '' a pool cue assault and a fatal round of golf all precede it. The year is 1953. On board a 72-foot yacht docked at the Newport Beach  Calif.  marina  two black men -- caddies at a Los Angeles golf club -- shoot and kill the boat's captain  stab and kill the boat's wealthy owner  rape the owner's young wife  slice off one of her nipples and then . . . well  then get stymied trying to start the yacht's engines in order to steal it. It's a bungle that leads to their deaths  execution-style  by a police detective named Miller Packard. Packard and the widow  Norah Still  fill two of the novel's three starring roles  the other is reserved for Lionel Walk  better known as Train  another black caddie at the same golf club. The subsequent intersections of their lives -- organic  erratic  inevitable and sometimes truly random -- form the novel's plot. Immediately we're drawn to Train. He's ''almost 18 years old  but innocent-looking for that age  still hadn't grown into his feet  and when he spoke  it was soft and mumbled.'' He dotes upon a dog that he rescued after it was hit by a car and left for dead and plucks half-eaten sandwiches from the trash to feed to ducks on the golf course. The yard of his mother's house in Darktown  a fictional Los Angeles ghetto  is a neighborhood curiosity because grass grows there -- thanks to Train  who smuggled grass seed from the golf club ''a little at a time in his pants pocket.'' Sweet-hearted and skeptical  Train provides the novel its moral compass. Packard  on the other hand  is a tougher sell. In fiction  at least  we've seen the likes of him before: a World War II combat veteran (he survived the sinking of the cruiser Indianapolis)  Packard resumed civilian life with a yen for danger and the old thousand-yard stare (''old'' being a slightly better modifier here than ''clichéd '' though the needle of this reviewer's judgment  on this count  could be bumped by the thinnest of breezes). The ''Mile Away Man '' Train calls him  hammering the nail a little too hard. Like Paris Trout  the eponymous murderer at the center of Dexter's National Book Award-winning 1988 novel  Packard is ''principled in the truest way. His right and wrong were completely private.'' He dispatches the rapists on the yacht with all the grim self-assurance of a Mickey Spillane hero. But then  like Train  he takes in stray dogs and also  for muted reasons all his own  takes in traumatized widows and sweet-hearted caddies. Despite his wartime traumas  he seems to believe  rosily  that he can make order from chaos  that people can be pulled from the cracks they've fallen into  that the road to hell is not truly paved with good intentions. Dexter begs to differ. ''Awful things happen not only to people who deserved it '' he writes  ''but also to people who just seemed to stumble in at the wrong time  walking into the picture as the shutter clicked  through no fault of their own.'' That Norah had written an impassioned letter in support of eight blacks charged with murder in Waycross  Ga.  writing that ''any act of violence between the Negroes and the white race had to be understood in a political context '' that she'd ''made a point of using her N.A.A.C.P. membership card for identification every place she wrote a check'' -- nothing she'd done could immunize her from what happened on the yacht. ''When the wires actually touched '' she realizes  ''good intentions and bad intentions were all the same.'' Not that Dexter doesn't hedge his bet: Norah's murdered husband  29 years her senior  had enjoyed watching her have sex with younger men  one of whom was a caddie at the golf club he belonged to  and -- minor surprise -- was one of the men executed on the yacht. The narrative shape of a Dexter novel often resembles a squid  solid and contained up front  a mess of squiggles in back. ''Train'' is no different: minor plotlines  like that involving a crusading newspaperman trying to ferret out the truth of the executions (no Dexter novel would be complete without a lurking newsman)  veer off from the main body of the book  leading nowhere  while other plot tendrils wiggle about  unmoored  as Dexter builds up to the last boom of violence. Much of the luster of Dexter's oeuvre owes a good deal to his ear for regional dialect  and his fly-tier's knack for detail -- how many writers can get South Philly and southern Georgia equally right? -- and ''Train'' doesn't dull that luster  despite the rain cloud of movie-house noir that follows Packard into every scene. As always  Dexter gets violence on paper with a harsh precision  and the pages turn with a potboiler's fleetness. When the final boom rumbles  readers are likely to be up well past their bedtimes. If that boom turns out to be just a bit unsatisfying  surprising without being self-evident  a touch erratic  well  ''things work the way they work '' as Dexter writes  in life as well as fiction. Sometime it happen. Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/opinion/masha-gessen-on-the-murder-of-boris-nemtsov.html,Russia’s Army of Avengers Advertisement Supported by None The scariest thing about the murder of Boris Nemtsov is that he himself did not scare anyone. “He was no threat to the current Russian leadership and to Vladimir Putin ” said the Russian president’s press secretary  Dmitri Peskov  eerily echoing comments the president made in 2006  when the opposition journalist Anna Politkovskaya was killed. By this Mr. Peskov meant that the Kremlin did not kill Mr. Nemtsov  a former first deputy prime minister  who was gunned down in central Moscow on Friday night.  In all likelihood no one in the Kremlin actually ordered the killing — and this is part of the reason Mr. Nemtsov’s murder marks the beginning of yet another new and frightening period in Russian history. The Kremlin has recently created a loose army of avengers who believe they are acting in the country’s best interests  without receiving any explicit instructions. Despite his lack of political clout  Mr. Nemtsov was a logical first target for this menacing force. Russia is a country at war — it has been waging battle against Ukraine for a year — and like any country at war  it has focused much of its rhetorical effort on the domestic opposition. The word “opposition” itself is misleading: It suggests having access to media and electoral and social mechanisms  when those have ceased to exist in Russia. More accurately  there are a number of individuals in Russia who are capable of gathering small groups of supporters  waging limited local electoral action  transmitting messages through the tiny remnants of independent media and occasionally organizing street protests. In the small space available to the Russian opposition  Mr. Nemtsov occupied a unique place. He had become active in politics during perestroika  and in 1991  when Mr. Nemtsov was 32  President Boris Yeltsin appointed him governor of the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast  an important industrial region on the Volga River. Nemtsov was one of the youngest people among the political players of the 1990s  and he seemed to embody the new era: He did not come from the Communist Party nomenklatura  he extolled political and economic reform  and his patronymic indicated that he was Jewish — a fact that he  breaking with the custom of the Soviet era  did not try to hide. In 1997  Mr. Yeltsin asked him to come to Moscow to join the cabinet  and there was talk of him succeeding Mr. Yeltsin as president. But the ailing Russian president seemed capable neither of giving up power nor of running the country. He chose potential successors fast and disposed of them ever faster  eventually alienating anyone with political capital. In 1999  Mr. Yeltsin finally settled on a former KGB agent named Vladimir Putin  setting his original anointed successor  Mr. Nemtsov  on a path to opposition politics. That road was neither easy nor direct for Mr. Nemtsov. First he tried to do political business with Mr. Putin: He headed a party that had seats in the first Putin-era Parliament and even fielded a presidential candidate. But as Mr. Putin refashioned Russia into an authoritarian country  Mr. Nemtsov was forced out of what passed for electoral politics  and became one of the first establishment politicians to sound the alarm about the nature of Mr. Putin’s regime. For years almost no one was interested in what Mr. Nemtsov had to say. He and his handful of allies would stand outside Moscow subway stations handing out brochures with their reports on high-level corruption. These were difficult reading: The writing was overwrought  reminiscent of the agitprop of old. And Russians seemed to be living too well to be interested in the quality of their government. When they finally started paying attention to corruption  they listened to a man almost two decades younger than Mr. Nemtsov  the blogger Aleksei Navalny  who spread the message in a much hipper way. When Russia suddenly erupted in protest in December 2011  Mr. Nemtsov found that he was perceived as an old fogie. On May 6  2012  when the police cracked down on a peaceful  legal protest  Mr. Nemtsov staged an impromptu sit-in at the foot of the Big Stone Bridge across from the Kremlin with a group of men all young enough to be his children. The protests fizzled  but Mr. Nemtsov stuck with them. He was a lead instigator of a protest march planned for March 1 in Moscow. Following his killing  remaining organizers scrapped plans for the march in favor of a vigil in Mr. Nemtsov’s memory.  While it is true that this activity hardly threatened Mr. Putin’s hold on power  Mr. Nemtsov made every internet list of “enemies of Russia” circulated by the Kremlin’s supporters. In the almost three years since Mr. Putin returned to the presidency  and especially in the year since Russia annexed Crimea  the Kremlin has increasingly focused on the enemy within. A new movement called Anti-Maidan marched through Moscow two weeks ago calling for violence against the “fifth column.” At least one of the signs carried at the march named Mr. Nemtsov as the organizer of the Ukrainian revolution. Less than a week after that march  and just before the one he had organized  Mr. Nemtsov was gunned down while walking a bridge that spans the Moscow River right in front of the Kremlin. It is under constant camera and live surveillance. The message was clear: People will be killed in the name of the Kremlin  in plain view of the Kremlin  against the backdrop of the Kremlin  simply for daring to oppose the Kremlin.

https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/magazine/the-online-avengers.html,The Online Avengers Advertisement Supported by None None None The four boys soon started texting and talking to other students  claiming that Rehtaeh willingly had sex with each of them. The rumors whipped through the student body  along with a cellphone photo  taken by one of the boys  of another boy having sex with Rehtaeh. The following Saturday  Rehtaeh and her mother  Leah Parsons  went to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and reported that she had been raped. A few days later  when they were able to get a copy of the explicit photo  they took it to the police and were told there would be an investigation. According to Leah Parsons  it then took 10 months for the police to try to interview the boys  who refused to talk to them. Their phones and computers were never searched  Parsons says. (A spokesman for the R.C.M.P. said he could not comment on the investigation.) A year after Rehtaeh made the rape claim  the police told her they didn’t have enough evidence to bring charges  either for assault or for distributing the photo  which could be considered illegal under child-pornography laws. None None As Ash read those questions in the garden in London  he felt a rising anger and clear sense of purpose. Rehtaeh was yet another victim  not just of the boys who had hurt her but of an indifferent system of law enforcement that further destroyed her reputation and sense of self by allowing them to get away with it. Ash was one of a growing number of Internet activists who try to protect vulnerable teenagers and avenge online bullying and sexual assault. He vowed that day he would do something about Rehtaeh Parsons’s death. None After reading about the case and following the reaction to it on Twitter  Ash began messaging with a Canadian geologist in her 30s who goes by the alias Katherine Wells. Katherine  too  was moved by the story and had reached out to Amanda’s mother and won her trust. Ash was impressed by Katherine’s willingness to take action and insert herself into events  and they decided to team up to help children and their families. The group  which they called OpAntiBully  soon grew to a core of eight  including two experienced hackers  and eventually a handful of others signed on  including a doctoral student in psychology in her 30s living in Scandinavia and a 14-year-old Dutch teenager whose parents didn’t know about his online life. None of the OpAntiBully members ever met in person  but they began spending hours working together online  using encrypted email accounts or chat rooms for anything they deemed sensitive. Katherine set up a Twitter account  @OpAntiBullyInfo  and encouraged young people who felt victimized to seek them out. OpAntiBully members posted links to resources for depressed teenagers and responded to pleas for help. Sometimes they would offer informal online counseling or send a flurry of encouraging messages to a desperate-sounding soul out in the ether. Other times they would take more aggressive measures  tracking down and exposing the identities of supposed wrongdoers who the group felt had not been brought to justice. Public shaming is a standard tool for this kind of activism  and it was part of OpAntiBully’s approach from the start — “it can be great fun to bully the bullies ” Ash says. This kind of outing  known as doxxing  involves scouring the Internet for personal data (or documents  the source of the word “doxx”) — like a person’s name  address  occupation  Twitter or Facebook profile — and then publicly linking that information to the perpetrator’s transgression. The process can be as simple as following a trail the target has left behind or it can involve tricking someone into revealing the password to a personal account or hacking into a website to obtain private information. The exposure  Ash says  is its own punishment. “People need to learn from their mistakes ” he said. “If it takes shocking or scaring them to do that  so be it. And sometimes we have apologies coming in  because people realize that what they’ve done is wrong.” OpAntiBully did its first major doxx in the fall of 2012 of four teenage boys in Texas who threatened a 12-year-old girl in New Zealand. She had never met the boys  but she was following one of them on Twitter  and then stopped after he tweeted something she didn’t like. The boy told her that he and three of his friends would “gang bang” her and that she should kill herself. “It’s scary to think people in the world want you to die :( ” the girl wrote to Katherine  after connecting with her online. Ash traced the boys’ Twitter accounts to their real names  figured out where they went to high school  then sent screen shots of their tweets  with their names and Twitter handles  to school officials. A couple of months later  Ash and another member saw a tweet under the hashtag “#pakisout.” It was a photo of a young girl who looked South Asian  along with a threat to hit her with a hammer. The two were able to track down the identity of the person who had posted the photo — a plumber in Scotland who they thought was working at the girl’s home. Despite all the ugliness he was seeing on the Internet  Ash told me his work buoyed him  especially when he was feeling low. “When we pieced together who [the plumber] was  it was all worth it ” he said. “It gives you a kick when you need it.” Ash and the two hackers in OpAntiBully are active members of Anonymous  the loose collective of agitators  hackers and pranksters who for the past decade have periodically banded together on the Internet to protest or take matters into their own hands in the name of any number of causes. Anonymous has no structure — no official leadership or hierarchy — and operates through a constellation of subgroups  which form and reform  around specific operations (ops for short). Anons  as they call themselves  like to say there are no rules  which means that at any given moment  Anonymous can be whatever someone says it is  and “membership” has more to do with a sense of mission than with formal belonging. In its early days  around 2006  Anonymous was about the “lulz ” or the laughs  often crass pranks that were directed at anyone who set the group off. But in the past five years  the group has become increasingly politicized  coalescing at first around the defense of free speech and an uncensored Internet. In the last year or so  Anonymous has taken on what’s called “white knight work ” which has mostly involved coming to the aid of girls who say they were the victims of sexual assault that the police failed to address. White-knight ops aren’t about Internet freedoms  but they are in keeping with the Anonymous ethos of distrusting and challenging mainstream authority. “When you see a convergence of scumbaggery and the sense that the police are not doing their jobs  along with hypocrisy and corruption  that definitely interests Anonymous ” says Gabriella Coleman  an anthropologist at McGill University who is working on a book about the group. As one veteran Anon called Crypt0nymous told me  “People have to bring justice in the name of the law if the government does not do it.” Anons tend to see the cases in which they intervene in polarized terms  parables with an innocent victim  evil perpetrators and ineffectual (or corrupt) law enforcement. There have been notable instances in which the pressure they created from a distance brought needed scrutiny to a case that had otherwise been ignored or buried. But because these activists have no local roots  they can also be blind to important subtleties and wind up falsely accusing or demonizing innocent people. Whether an op does good or ill depends entirely on the care of the people who sign on  because there are no built-in checks  no authority figure who can call off Anonymous. On the day in April when Ash first learned about Rehtaeh Parsons  he spent his lunch break sending messages about the case to several OpAnti­Bully members. The group quickly agreed that the first goal was to figure out who the boys were. Members of the team started looking for clues on social media. Ash had to go back to his day job  but  he said  “every spare moment I had I would check my accounts and see how everything was coming together.” At day’s end he rushed to the bus stop for his hourlong commute  arriving at the home he shared with his girlfriend of nine years and then spending the rest of the evening working on tracking down the boys’ identities. “For nothing to happen to the boys who did that to Rehtaeh  . . .” Ash said. “We wanted to strike fear into their hearts.” None We walked to a shady courtyard by the Thames for lunch. Ash has a nervous habit of cracking his knuckles. A tattoo on the back of one arm reads  in looping cursive  “I swear I’ll never give in or refuse.” In high school  he said  he hacked into his online yearbook and turned some of the entries about individual students into jokes. “I changed loads of them ” he said with a grin. The stunt got him kicked out of his classes for business and I.T.  Ash said  and he was told he “had no future.” Instead of university  he went to night school to learn engineering. His work was steady but he found it dull  it’s his activist life that consumes him and feels full of promise and opportunity. “It’s hard for me to turn off my laptop at night ” he said  acknowledging that this was a source of tension between him and his girlfriend. When the three of us ate dinner together  she made clear that she had no desire to talk about OpAntiBully. And yet that was the subject that made Ash light up. His dream  he said  was to apply for a grant to start a website devoted to white-knight work. “If I could quit my job and do this all day long  10 hours a day  the effect and the fulfillment would be massive ” he said. If Ash’s girlfriend didn’t appreciate this  his fellow OpAntiBully members did. I talked to Ash and Katherine together over Skype soon after they started OpAntiBully. They were like a couple in the honeymoon phase of a relationship  finishing each other’s sentences and insisting that it didn’t matter that they had never met in the real world. “It gets to a point where the realism of someone — what they look like  what they do for a living — is secondary ” Ash said. “You really get to know people online. If anything  they share more.” The relationships between Ash  Katherine and other members of OpAntiBully were intimate and intense enough to create their own reality: a thick web of romanticized expectations. When I asked whether anyone in the group had experience working with teenagers  Ash said no  but that it didn’t matter  because Katherine “is brilliant at talking to people. She’s the mother hen.” In London  I talked to five members of the group over a messaging service called ChatCrypt. Ash sat next to me  reading along on his battered Samsung laptop. When I asked about issues of trust  Rabz  the 14-year-old Dutch boy  instantly typed back referring to some of the other members by versions of their Twitter handles: “PA  Ash  BBJ and Hooligan are basically my big bros  and Pri is my sis.” Primus  the Scandinavian graduate student  wrote: “We both work and play. We are friends. What do you do with your friends? We do the same. Online. Across borders.” “I’d never trust my IRL [in real life] friends the way I trust these folks ” BBJ wrote. Rabz concurred: “IRL friends don’t share the passion like us.” “I have few solid irl friends ” Primus wrote. “But my real social life is online. That may sound sad for an outsider. But I am a very content and fulfilled person. These people share my values. My passion. And most of them have never even seen my face. It’s a special kind of love. Free from judgment — that most people encounter in the real world.” Ash has been looking for this kind of community since he took his first step toward online activism about six years ago  by “lurking” on a chat board called 4Chan /b/  where users competed to post the most grotesquely memorable images. 4Chan /b/ was a venue for shared dark humor  the posts (mostly by men) were often also offensive or explicit. Some users went on to start Anonymous. “The key to 4Chan was that someone who just stumbled on it would never want to go back ” Ash said  explaining that the crude nature of the content helped to wall off the insiders. “You wanted it to be as gut-churning as possible  so what you get is a tightknit group of people who don’t seem to have strong ties outside and become incredibly close on the web.” When I asked Ash how he squared his ongoing affection for the creepiness of 4Chan with his work for OpAntiBully  he said it was all about intent. “I’m fine with taking it quite close to the bone. But never with malice. That’s the difference.” Plus  he said  “adults can sort things out for themselves. We’re here for the well-being of kids.” He described how he was pushed around as a young boy and decided  when he started secondary school  that he’d had enough. “I didn’t want to be in that victim role anymore.” He also told me about becoming close to a girl  when he was in his teens and 20s  who was being sexually abused. The relationship led him to read books about rape and sexual coercion  and he came to the understanding that “it’s about dominating girls. It’s less about the sex and more about control.” None None None None Although many Anons condemned Lostutter for glory-seeking  the events in Steubenville revealed the dark side of white-knight vigilantism as much as its capacity to shame wrongdoers. As one Twitter user (not from Anonymous) wrote to me: “Do we really want mob mentality and the unaccountable influencing prosecutorial decisions? Today it’s good. Tomorrow?” None Elias started working with Anonymous during the Arab spring  when the group helped dissidents throughout the region circumvent government-imposed blackouts of the Internet. His main contribution was writing news releases — he was interested in political organizing  not hacking. But he saw the second as a tool of the first. “I’ve never committed any cybercrimes  to my knowledge ” he said. “I’m still nervous about all of that. But if Anonymous didn’t hack or take sites down  you wouldn’t be talking to me right now. To raise awareness  we are required to resort to spectacle.” None When Ash saw the tweet  he and OpAntiBully had just started to work on their own doxxing  and he messaged Elias to discuss joining forces. They were both a little wary  having never worked together  but they had mutual contacts  which each used to do the Anonymous equivalent of a reference check. With other groups sprouting all over the Internet  Ash and Elias were each looking for a reputable partner. When Elias invited Ash to join OpJustice4Rehtaeh and to bring his team with him  Ash felt it was a moment of affirmation. “You can’t get into the ops with big names  like this one  out of the blue ” he said. None The OpJustice4Rehtaeh team divided their responsibilities. Katherine helped lead a group that concentrated on a Facebook page called Speak the Truth  which was started by the family of one of the boys accused of rape  to declare his innocence. The police warned the family that they had implicated their son by naming him  and the family took the page down — but not before Katherine and her team took screen shots and collected information on about 130 people  many of whom were harshly critical of Rehtaeh. The rest of the op focused on determining the other three boys’ identities. They confirmed a second teenager’s involvement and figured out that his mother owned a business  and from there it was easy to collect information about her. The working document soon ran to 37 pages. At the top was a list of rules (or rulez)  which included jokes (“No smoking in the chat room”)  actual rules (“Invitations are by 100% consensus”) and admonitions (“Get sleep. Working 36 hours straight makes you sloppy”). None Leah Parsons  Rehtaeh’s mother  watched the video. It was the first time she ever heard of Anonymous. “I was a bit hesitant and a bit nervous ” she told me. “You have to ask: ‘Who are these people? What are their intentions?’ ” None Her stance was a blow to Ash and others working on the op. “That knocked us back ” Ash said. The group had nailed down the identities of all four boys  and there were plans for a live demonstration to protest the police handling of the case. Elias and Ash thought the group should respect Parsons’s wishes  but others itched to expose the boys anyway. “It was hard to hold them back  ” Ash said. “People wanted to release what we knew.” None Elias reached out to his press contacts to vouch for the boy  but he didn’t feel responsible for the false accusations. “I can’t control what other people are going to do ” he told me. “That’s how Anonymous works. I can’t tell anyone else what to do  and I can’t stop them.” Despite Elias’s efforts to separate OpJustice4Rehtaeh from the other Anon groups  to most people on the outside  the ops were indistinguishable. None None The boy replied: “O.K. I understand  there may be things in this that may be very disturbing to you  but I need to let you know.” He described drinking with Rehtaeh and another boy  whom he named  and said they both had consensual sex with her. The sex continued  the boy wrote  but “Reh looked like she was going to get sick  so I asked her  and she said she was good but then she started to quinch a bit.” The boy opened the bedroom window and he and the other boy “helped her over so she could get sick  she was out the window for about 5 mins.” The boy said he kept having sex with her  and “being a drunk idiot  I posed for the picture.” Two other boys  whose names he also provided  tried to carry Rehtaeh into another room. One of them “tryed to pick her up and she hit him in the face ” the boy wrote. Later  he learned that the other two boys had sex with Rehtaeh that night  too. “Even though I am good friends with all of them I cannot lie to you and say we all did not rape her ” he wrote. “I can tell you for sure that I did not rape her and while I was at the house I did not see any of the other 3 boys do anything that would cause her harm.” He also wrote  “Yes I will admit to bragging about the picture for a few weeks and Yes I did send it to some people. . . . I have a lot of people mad at me over this. . . . That picture ruined my life and it is the worst thing that happened to me  I am truely very sorry for this.” He closed by explaining that when the news of Rehtaeh’s death hit Facebook  people he knew sent him messages blaming him. “I then went to my room and cryed.” Leah Parsons felt sick for her daughter  but she also saw the message as an admission — grim vindication that Rehtaeh had told the truth. She turned it over to the police  and also to OpJustice­4Rehtaeh. “I gave it to them  and then I thought: I don’t really know who they are ” Parsons told me. “But they’d respected everything I’d said. I thought  If pressure from this group is what it takes  let them do what they do.” Elias wrote another news release  demanding police action  and sent it to Your­AnonymousNews. Meanwhile  an Anon outside of the op broke the law by hacking into the boy’s Facebook account. The person found another version of the note he wrote to Parsons and sent it to an encrypted account the op had set up for tips. When the boy’s family found out about the hacking  they tried to fight back. “Your saying your sticking up for a girl who was bullied but yet you nasty people are nothing but cowards to hide behind anonymous and hack teenagers facebook profiles ” the boy’s sister wrote on Facebook. “Your just as bad as the ones who bullied her.” None MacRae stressed that the new lead — the Facebook message Leah Parsons passed on to the police — “did not come from an online source.” To Ash  Elias and the rest of their celebrating team  this was mere face-saving. They felt they were instrumental in shifting the stance of the entire Canadian government. “It’s quite a nice feeling when you can see the authorities are wrong  and you can twist their arm behind them to get them to change course ” Ash said. In the end  they hadn’t publicly doxxed anyone  which made the victory sweeter for Elias. “If we’re smart enough  we don’t even have to resort to those tactics ” he said. None “You can’t give everyone apart from Primus access ” he wrote back. A bitter power struggle ensued  and other members of the group took sides. In June  Katherine and Ash fought over control of OpAntiBully’s Twitter account  and Katherine and a few others left the group. “It was almost like they had a lover’s quarrel  only it wasn’t ” Primus told me. Katherine called it “a breakdown in my personal friendship with him — a breakdown of trust.” Meanwhile  Ash’s girlfriend told him she wasn’t in love with him anymore. His real life and online relationships were disintegrating at the same time. Then in August  Ash used the OpAntiBully Twitter account to attack Katherine  accusing her of looking for “media stories to get you on the TV.” That kind of personal use of the group’s account violated the rules  and Ash was forced to hand over control of the account. “We can’t have disturbances like that on there ” Primus said. “It has to be a safe haven for the youth.” OpAntiBully disbanded  but the fighting continued. Others in Anonymous lined up behind Katherine or Ash  threatening to strip them of their anonymity — a form of disgrace in their online world. In October  Ash outed himself before someone else did it for him  publishing his name and picture on Twitter. Katherine’s personal information soon appeared online  too. When I Skyped with Ash a month or so later  he was plainly miserable. “Ironic for an antibully op  isn’t it?” he said. “A real waste from what people should be doing.” He rubbed his temples. “It’s been awful ” he said  his voice cracking. “We were a brilliant group. I wanted us to grow. Now I don’t. I just want a few people I can trust.” He seemed young and vulnerable  not much different  in a way  from the people he had been trying to help. The kinship Ash felt with them in part explained his tireless passion for white-knight work. But the breakdown of OpAntiBully reflected the complicated nature of Ash’s motives for creating it  and Katherine’s too. They thirsted for community  for acceptance. But when the relationships within the group started to fray  there was no protocol for managing the bad feeling — no filter between the work and the personal disputes. In the end  the ties among them weren’t stronger than real-life ties. They were too tenuous and the emotions too volatile to hold the group together. Instead of taking down the tormentors of defenseless children  they took down one another. None The article in The Star was fuel for a new op. Reported over seven months  it detailed the accusations of sexual assault of two young teenagers in Maryville  Mo.  a town of 12 000. Daisy Coleman  14  and Paige Parkhurst  13  were hanging out at Daisy’s house one night in January 2012  drinking from a secret supply of alcohol and texting with 17-year-old Matthew Barnett  a football player who noticed Daisy when she joined the high-school cheerleading squad. The girls sneaked out of Daisy’s bedroom window late that night  the article said  and Barnett drove them to his house. When they arrived  other boys were there  and Daisy drank two big glasses of alcohol  she wasn’t sure what kind. She couldn’t remember what happened next. Paige went into a bedroom with a 15-year-old boy who later said  according to the police  that “although the girl said ‘no’ multiple times  he undressed her  put a condom on and had sex with her.” Daisy had to be carried out of the bedroom where she had gone with Barnett  unable to speak coherently  Paige said. She cried as the boys took her to the car  Paige and three boys told the police. The boys drove the girls home. In the early morning  Daisy’s mother  Melinda Coleman  heard a scratching sound at the door. It was Daisy. The boys had left her outside  in 22-degree weather  wearing a T-shirt and sweatpants. Melinda Coleman  a veterinarian whose husband died in a car accident three years earlier  took her daughter inside for a warm bath. When she saw red marks on her body  she called 911 and took Daisy to the hospital. The police shifted into high gear. “Within four hours  we had obtained a search warrant for the house and executed that ” Darren White  the sheriff  told The Star. “We had all of the suspects in custody and had audio/video confessions.” He said there was “no doubt” a crime had been committed. The county prosecutor  Robert Rice  brought sexual-assault charges against Barnett and one other boy — and then  saying he lacked evidence  dropped them. Barnett’s grandfather was a longtime state representative. He said he stayed out of the case. But some people pointed to his influence as an explanation for not pressing charges. Melinda Coleman moved her family out of the town. The house they lived in  and still owned  burned down months later. Investigators couldn’t determine the cause of the fire. None Elias didn’t know that OpAntiBully had broken up. When I told him about the split  he said: “That kind of infighting happens all the time in and around Anonymous. These ops are very emotional experiences  and it gets very personal. In the end  the way people act online does reflect who they are in real life.” Within hours  Elias’s Maryville op took off. A local activist in Missouri picked up #Justice4­Daisy and used it to organize a live demonstration outside the courthouse. Maryville trended on Twitter. Crypt0nymous made an Anonymous video that was viewed 130 000 times on YouTube in two days. The city manager’s office reported an onslaught of calls and emails. The next day  Missouri’s lieutenant governor and the state speaker of the house called for new investigations. White  the Maryville sheriff  lashed out at Anonymous in the press: “They all need to get jobs and quit living with their parents.” But Rice announced that he would appoint a special prosecutor to reopen the case. Elias tweeted: “I love the Internet.” Earlier this month  with the case still awaiting action from the special prosecutor  Daisy Coleman was hospitalized after trying to commit suicide  and the #OpMaryville hashtag circulated again on Twitter  as users posted messages of support for her and vented their anger at the police and others in Maryville. A few days later Barnett pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of child endangerment for leaving Daisy out in the cold. A judge ordered him to serve two years’ probation and apologize to Daisy. She and her mother said they accepted this resolution of the case. Elias felt as if he had this much figured out: Anonymous was a sharp weapon. He knew it could be misused. He had seen the self-righteousness of an op burn innocent people  and he had seen plenty of Anons and activists turn on each other  as Ash and Katherine had. But he wasn’t ready to give up the satisfaction of changing the course of events without leaving his apartment  in a place hundreds of miles away. Why set down the weapon of Anonymous if you believe you can master it? Advertisement ,articles/movies

She died of Covid-19. None None On the streets of New Haven  Conn.  Margaret Holloway was known as the “Shakespeare Lady ” a tall  striking woman in ragged clothing who recited dramatic monologues for spare change. Her stage  often  was outside Willoughby’s coffee shop  a hangout for Yale students and professionals. Her repertoire included “The Tempest ” “Macbeth” and the Greek alphabet  which she acted out letter by letter. None Ms. Holloway was a 1980 graduate of the Yale School of Drama and a once-promising director  playwright and actor. In the early 1970s she was a drama major at Bennington College in Vermont. “She was star of the theater department ” Laura Spector  a college friend  said in an interview. “She was so talented  so powerful  so magnetic.” Ms. Holloway’s career was cut short by mental illness and drug addiction soon after she left Yale. But she never stopped seeking understanding  human connection and  above all  artistic expression. None Ms. Holloway died at 68 on May 30 at Yale New Haven Hospital. Gloria Astarita  her court-appointed conservator  said the cause was the novel coronavirus. None Living in a dingy rooming house or on the streets  Ms. Holloway performed in the shadow of Yale’s campus  clinging  in a way  to a time in her life when she was healthy  successful and full of promise. Through it all her aspirations remained high-minded. “She would want to have a disquisition about directing some Shakespeare play ” Ms. Channick said. “Having those conversations with someone who was living on the streets  it was jarring. Here’s this person so connected to people  well-educated  with a love of art and theater  whose life was destroyed by mental illness.” Margaret Ann Holloway was born on Sept. 7  1951  in Albany  Ga.  to the Rev. Walter Holloway  a minister  and Bertha (Prince) Holloway  a homemaker. Ms. Holloway became estranged from her family as an adult. Through a nonprofit group that provides scholarships to gifted minority students  Ms. Holloway attended Northfield Mount Hermon  a prep school in Massachusetts. She attended Carleton College in Minnesota for a year before transferring to Bennington  where she came into her own as a drama student. Ms. Spector said she vividly remembered the one-woman autobiographical play that Ms. Holloway wrote  directed and starred in for her senior thesis  a work that dealt with her upbringing as a young black woman in the rural South. “She brought down the house ” Ms. Spector said. After decades out of touch  Ms. Spector reconnected with Ms. Holloway in 2005 after reading a newspaper article about her. She found the same lively  gregarious  emotionally intelligent person she had known. “I knocked on the door and from the top of the stairs she called out  ‘Laura  how the hell are you?’” Ms. Spector said. “She didn’t miss a beat.” Ms. Holloway  who stopped performing in the street about three years ago because of failing health  found a measure of stability and calm in recent times. Residing in a nursing home in New Haven  she had clean clothes  regular meals  a shower and monthly visits from Ms. Channick and other friends  who brought her money and the small luxuries she asked for  like lipstick. “We would talk about what was going on in the world ” Ms. Channick said. “But mostly  we would talk about theater.”

https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/fashion/in-iowa-the-drama-behind-the-drama-scene-city.html,In Iowa  the Drama Behind the Drama Advertisement Supported by Scene City None DES MOINES “I’M a fly in the buttermilk ” declared Donna Brazile  busily tweeting away from a front-row seat at Mitt Romney’s press center here Tuesday night  as the Republican caucus results trickled in. Ms. Brazile  a Democratic strategist  was alternating between her Twitter live stream and live commentary for CNN  popping out of the room so she could be piped right back in on the two large screens that were switching among CNN  Fox News and MSNBC. “I’m here on behalf of CNN  so I have to be on my best behavior ” she said with a mischievous smile  before adding  more philosophically  “It’s been interesting watching history rather than trying to make history.” Every four years  for a few hours on a cold Tuesday night in January  Iowa becomes the center of the political world  and the gatherings in rented halls or hotel ballrooms are filled with what passes for boldface names on the campaign trail: political consultants  veteran newspaper reporters  well-coiffed TV anchors and newly minted bloggers trying to make a name for themselves. This year brought more of the same  plus an unusual dash of real drama  in election results that were not clear until well after midnight. At the Romney event at the Hotel Fort Des Moines  hours before the candidate eked out an eight-vote early morning victory over Rick Santorum  the ballroom was crowded but largely glamour-free as a group of supporters and grass-roots volunteers piled in to wait for the county-by-county returns. Representative Jason Chaffetz  a Utah Republican  sat off to the side  gamely giving interviews  and Matt Viser of The Boston Globe (a dead ringer for Mr. Romney’s youngest son  Craig) wandered around the hotel  looking a lot like  well  Craig Romney. Asked about the evening’s star power  an aide at the ballroom entrance joked  “Brad Pitt is going to be coming through that door in 20 minutes.” (We waited  and Mr. Pitt was not forthcoming  though Tagg Romney  another of the candidate’s sons  turned a few heads as he walked through the hotel corridor.) “I’m wishing for a Huckabee/Chuck Norris moment ” said a wistful television producer  referring to the 2008 caucuses  when  in a bizarre twist  Mr. Huckabee would go onstage to introduce Mr. Norris as the main attraction. None 8 Photos None Perhaps the most glamorous attendees of the night were Mr. Romney’s advance team. They had traded their usual road-warrior clothes for sharp dark suits  and were dashing around whispering into their wristpieces like the men of “Ocean’s Eleven.” In Johnston  Iowa  the air in the ballroom of the Stoney Creek Inn  a faux log cabin mountain lodge next to a strip mall  was thick with an odd assortment of smells during Mr. Santorum’s caucus-night party there on Tuesday — diesel exhaust from the satellite trucks outside  brewing coffee and hair spray. That last aroma was courtesy of Matt Belanger  a reporter from WGAL  the NBC station in Lancaster  Pa. Mr. Santorum  a former Pennsylvania senator  was Mr. Belanger’s local-boy-makes-it-big story. And Mr. Belanger wasn’t going on the air to tell it with a hair out of place. Baby-faced and just 28  Mr. Belanger was practically quivering with excitement at being thrown into the hottest political story of the moment. His enthusiasm was so intense  it outpaced the actual news. He was putting what he thought would be the finishing touches on his script (and his pancake makeup) more than an hour before Mr. Santorum came out to address the swelling crowd of several hundred supporters. “Rick Santorum won the Iowa caucuses ...” He turned to another reporter and asked  unsure  “I can say he won  right?” Of course  Mr. Santorum actually lost to Mitt Romney by those eight votes. But who has time to sweat details on such a tight deadline? Mr. Belanger was in the company of some of the biggest names in television news. Jake Tapper of ABC News and Kelly O’Donnell of NBC News were sharing a riser a few feet from the stage. John Dickerson of CBS News was alternating live reports and blogging. While there was a definite party atmosphere  the financially pinched Santorum campaign wasn’t quite liquid enough to pay for the banks of desks  wireless Internet and refreshments that often accompany such affairs. Thirsty for a Bud Light? That’ll be $4. As the evening progressed toward its nail-biting conclusion  Mr. Belanger was soaking it all in. “It was very neat to be able to be surrounded by media from around the world following him ” he said. “For me to be able to pose Pennsylvania-focused questions was really quite an honor.” Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/theater/stephen-sondheim-playwright.html,It’s Not the Music. It’s Not the Lyrics. It’s the Drama. Sondheim at 90 Let’s not underrate Stephen Sondheim any longer: Theater’s greatest songwriter is also one of theater’s greatest playwrights. Here’s why. None Supported by None “Where you going?” a man asks the woman leaving his bed one morning — possibly expecting her to say  “to the bathroom.” Instead she says  “Barcelona.” Or  rather  she sings it  because the joke as well as the character insight — she’s a stewardess — are part of a song that became its own three-act mini-drama in the 1970 musical “Company.” Act One: Bobby  the man  tries to get April  the stewardess  to come back to bed but fails. None Act Three: When she accedes to his relentless importuning  he is instantly horrified. “Oh  God ” he sings  having achieved the companionship he never wanted. Blackout. None And all this is done in classical A-B-A form  to a sweetly lazy tune befitting the morning-after setting  with apt but gentle rhymes (“going”/“Boeing”) and punch lines that are not just punches. They help you sympathize a little more with Bobby  even if you like him a little less. No one has so consistently and so widely across tonalities and topics worked that “Barcelona” effect like Sondheim. Which is why I’ve come to feel that  for all his accolades — eight Tony Awards  five Oliviers  an Oscar  a Pulitzer Prize and a Presidential Medal of Freedom — he is still  turning 90  underacknowledged. None But listening again to the 15 major stage works for which he has served as both composer and lyricist  I find myself thinking not of Sondheim the word man or of Sondheim the music man but of Sondheim the dramatist. Having long taken for granted that he is the greatest composer-lyricist the United States has produced  we can perhaps now notice that he is also an artist to place in the line of America’s foundational 20th-century playwrights. In years to come  critics will have trouble understanding how our time put him in one basket but put Tennessee Williams  Arthur Miller  August Wilson and Edward Albee in another. Well  they’ll understand this part of it: Musical theater is a much more collaborative field than nonmusical theater  Sondheim never wrote the books for his own projects  rarely even initiating them. (Exceptions: “Sweeney Todd ” “Passion ” “Road Show.”) But one of the things that the people who did write those books must have learned to accept  and in some cases treasure  is the way he cannibalized their work until not much was left of it but the bones. Sometimes he even ate the bones  “Barcelona” is the entire scene  no dialogue needed. So while the stories of all 15 shows were collaborations  by the time they got musicalized  the drama was mostly Sondheim’s. That’s especially obvious in the great works built on middling books. In “Company” and “Merrily We Roll Along” (both by George Furth) and “Follies” (by James Goldman)  the spoken parts are almost always where the action isn’t  you sit through them to get to the songs. The proof is everywhere. When directors looking for challenges (or engaging in rescue fantasies) overhaul the Sondheim oeuvre  it’s not his contribution they try to reinvent. Take the new version of “Company” opening on Broadway this month  in which the director Marianne Elliott (with Sondheim’s encouragement — he’s the least precious auteur ever) keeps the score pretty much as it is but flips the prototypical toxic bachelor Bobby to a biological-clock-watching woman named Bobbie. Or “Merrily ” that great white whale of musical theater aspiration  with a hundred Ahabs bent on landing its jaw-dropping score and unworkable book  even if it means building a new whale in the process. If I sometimes wish that Sondheim  in his loyalty  had not lavished so much of his gift on material he had to elevate  it’s also the case that those works allow for elevation. Still  the dramatizing effect of Sondheim’s scores is more profound when both he and his collaborators are at their best. It’s a matter of taste  but I would include in the best-book category “Sweeney” and “A Little Night Music” (by Hugh Wheeler) and “Passion” and “Sunday in the Park With George” (by James Lapine). In these musicals and a few others  the raw material allowed Sondheim to create sequences in which neither music nor lyrics prevail but their interplay produces the heat of lived emotion. How does it happen? How does he get so often to the place where real drama happens  when even the greatest of his predecessors could get there only occasionally? None His use of rhyme is only the most obvious aspect of this. Whether quiet (like that “going”/“Boeing” matchup from “Company”) or showy (“personable”/“coercin’ a bull ” from the same show)  the pairings almost without exception scan perfectly and  beyond that  highlight meaningful connections between sounds instead of an over-clever Lorenz Hart-like coupling that amounts to a shotgun wedding. None That line is set to a musical phrase that coils in on itself for the first clause and leaps in joy for the second. If no one has ever exploited the thousand colors and astonishing coincidences of English to greater effect than Sondheim  that’s in part because no truly great lyricist  save possibly Cole Porter and Frank Loesser  has been his own composer. None None None Conflict like that is the essence of drama  which is why musicals too often seem thin when they try to approach the density of plays. Their emotional states are usually monaural  offering only one channel of perception at a time. The cowboy is happy  so he sings “Oh  What a Beautiful Mornin’.” The couple are either in love and say so  or in love but pretending not to be. The music may be delicious  the lyrics clever  but the situation is flat and generally inert  the songs are the release from the story instead of being the story itself. Rodgers and Hammerstein transcended that template but only so far. Sondheim’s study of their innovations (Hammerstein was his mentor) led him to workarounds that multiply the information available in any one moment of his shows. Sometimes it seems that even his subtext has subtext  putting down roots in the deepest murk of human complexity. It’s that complexity that has made so many songwriters of the ensuing generations into Sondheim slaves  seeking to recreate in their own voices the many aspects of his. Some get close  but there is a unique feeling of compression and perfectionism in a Sondheim score: Every musical gesture and every lyric does at least double duty. Exposition is character. Melodies are psychology. Rhymes are revelations. None And something even bigger happens when he is given space by his book writers — or  I suspect  when his own deepest engagement in the material causes him to commandeer that space. I’m talking about extended musical scenes like the opening sequence of “Sweeney ” with its screeching factory whistle  its busy ballad  its turbulent Thames-side mutterings  its comedy charm and yearning regret. At the end of it  Sweeney sings his only love song — the sinuous “My Friends” — to his razors. Or the letter scenes in “Passion ” turning the question of romantic love this way and that like a fidget spinner. None Such passages barely touch down to refuel. In their breadth and daring  they are akin to opera  except that the words are not a sequence of singable vowels but real thoughts that ripple with specificity. Expressing through conflict all manner of insight  they are thus less closely aligned with the grandeur of Puccini and Verdi than with Miller’s moral acuity  Williams’s poetry of human failure  Wilson’s outsider fury and Albee’s raised-eyebrow  zinger-filled existentialism. Through the shapes of melody they paint the lines of character. They do more than sing: They tell stories that move. None Or I might just answer: “Barcelona.” Advertisement ,articles/movies

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/theater/oslo-and-the-drama-in-diplomacy.html,‘Oslo’ and the Drama in Diplomacy Advertisement Supported by None None None The two men and their families had become friends through their daughters  who attended middle school together. Mr. Sher had invited his friend to rehearsals of “Blood and Gifts” to talk to the cast about his work as a diplomatic negotiator in the Middle East. Late on a bitterly cold January night  we met for warm drinks at an Upper West Side haunt a few blocks from the theater. Mr. Larsen had just seen my play. He was vivacious and charming  draped in understated European finery — including dress shoes so elegant I filed the detail away under the mental heading Interesting Character Trait. Peppering him with questions  I learned that his wife  Mona Juul  was Ambassador  Deputy Permanent Representative of the Norway Mission to the United Nations. Further  that they had both been deeply involved for years in the politics of the Middle East. As we ordered our second round  he got to the point. “We were part of a historic event ” Mr. Larsen said  “which we have waited 20 years to see written about.” I leaned in closely  eager to hear everything. As a playwright  I look to tell stories that are framed against great political rupture. I am obsessed with putting characters onstage who struggle with  and against  cascading world events — and who are changed forever through that struggle. While journalism sharpens our minds  the theater can expand our sense of what it means to be human. It is where we can come together in a communal space to hear ideas that grip us  surprise us — even infuriate us — as we learn of things we didn’t know. For me  that is a deeply  thrillingly  political act. I hunt perpetually for these kinds of stories. I look for them everywhere  but sometimes the story finds you. None Then he told me something I did not know: that there was a clandestine diplomatic back channel that had made the accords possible. That without a handful of men and women — Israeli  Palestinian and Norwegian — working in secret to try to alter the political reality of two peoples  those accords never would have happened. And when I heard that  I knew the writing of my next play had begun. I contacted Ms. Juul and asked if we could meet. She was surprised at my interest in these events  but eventually agreed to talk to me. In person she was charming as well  but far more reserved than her husband. She deftly steered the conversation away from her own career and achievements  graciously but firmly keeping herself from being the center of attention. I began a yearslong process of reading  travel and interviews with multiple participants as I sought to understand the full history of the secret channel — what came to be known as the Oslo Channel — through which the accords were birthed. Everything that Mr. Larsen and Ms. Juul had told me turned out to be in the public record — but they had downplayed their own involvement. In our conversations  they had focused on the accomplishments of the Israelis and Palestinians who were involved  but Mr. Larsen and Ms. Juul were the ones who midwifed the entire process. And  like the agreements themselves  their involvement proved to be deeply controversial. There are those who saw the Oslo Channel as a necessary and bold attempt to bring peace to the Middle East  there are others who saw it as reckless  naïve meddling that only added to the anguish in this region. The further I dug  the more gripped I became as a dramatist. Here was the stuff of theater — events that were almost preposterous in their strangeness: clandestine meetings  often run by those who had no experience with such things  people’s lives constantly put at risk  governments threatened with calamity  emotions rising and falling at an operatic scale  people pushed to the brink of what they thought possible as friendships were fused and torn apart. It became clear that Mr. Larsen and Ms. Juul would be characters at the very heart of the play. These were the sort of protagonists a writer looks for: two complicated  articulate people driven to achieve something far greater than themselves — who stumble  make mistakes  but keep pushing on. As I researched  I drew a tight bracket around the historic events directly preceding and occurring during the time of the Channel’s existence. I burrowed into this sliver of history as deeply as I could  to summon a specific moment in time and place. None None In the middle of endless bloodshed and hatred  members of the Israeli government and the P.L.O. chose to sit across from their enemy and see them as human beings. Each side listened to the other and was permanently changed by that listening. I am awed by the personal and political courage that took. It is a moment of history that I do not want forgotten.

https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/24/theater/breaking-the-motherhood-drama-with-a-drama-on-motherhood.html,"Breaking the Motherhood Drama With a Drama on Motherhood Advertisement Supported by None Two things stood out about the Wednesday matinee crowd blowing into the Cherry Lane Theater in the West Village last week. One  it was only 11 o'clock in the morning. Two  among the 170 or so theatergoers descending from chartered buses or air-kissing friends in the lobby  there was not a single man in sight. Pure estrogen in the house. Welcome to the ""Mom's Matinee"" of ""EVE-olution "" a two-woman play chronicling motherhood's bumps and triumphs  both existential and practical. Since the play's New York debut on Oct. 20  the Cherry Lane has experimented with luring busy mothers by starting early enough to allow the sacred 3 o'clock school pickup. (Most weekday matinees begin at 2.) ""We're from New Jersey  and we can get to see the show and get back in time to do all the afternoon activities with our children "" said Stacey Weiss of Woodcliff  N.J.  the mother of 10-year-old twin boys. She and her friend Beth Figman  who has three children  ages 14  12 and 9  were meeting with six other mothers to celebrate one mom's birthday. ""You're always juggling  whether you are a stay-at-home mom or a working mom "" said Ms. Figman  who stays at home. (Ms. Weiss works part time.) ""So when I got a flyer for what the play was about and it said it offered a mother's matinee. "" The experiment has worked so well that the Cherry Lane has decided to drop the 2 p.m. matinee altogether and to offer an 11 a.m. show every Wednesday  starting Dec. 1. (The 90-minute show also has an 8 p.m. curtain  Tuesdays through Saturdays  and a 3 p.m. one on Saturdays and Sundays as well.) The women -- and yes  they are pretty much all women -- arrive at the special matinees in pairs and groups. They come by subway and cab from the five boroughs  and by car and on chartered buses from New Jersey  Connecticut and the New York suburbs. At last Wednesday's matinee  two big yellow school buses from Rye  N.Y.  delivered two groups of about 40 women each  parents from the Rye Country Day School and the School of the Holy Child. While some women used the escape from the suburbs to grab lunch in the city  the group from Holy Child planned to eat box lunches on the bus trip back. Aside from its convenience  the play  written by two formerly working mothers about two formerly working mothers  particularly appeals to formerly working mothers. Patty Nasey  an Upper West Side mother of two who used to be an associate publisher of a magazine  attended a Tuesday night performance with a group of five other mothers from the Riverside Church Weekday School in Morningside Heights. That audience was mostly women  too  she said. ""There was the feeling among a lot of us of 'Oh  my God  they were in my apartment last week ""' she said of the sense of seeing your life onstage. That is not surprising  given the autobiographical nature of ""EVE-olution."" The playwrights Hilary Illick and Jennifer Krier met at a Mommy and Me gymnastics class in Cambridge  Mass.  in 2001. Its characters are Liza (Sabrina Le Beauf)  a writer  and Alison (Carolyn McCormick)  an anthropologist who gets a teaching job at Cornell. But then they have babies. The women's evolution takes the audience through their decision to stay at home  commuter marriage  sexual dry spells  depression and breaking points. Liza hides in the bushes outside her home to escape the kids. Alison slaps her daughter in a moment of anger. There is also intense  tender love for their husbands and their children. Liza and Alison conclude that the sense of self they had before motherhood has not survived. Which is fine. What they are left with is not knowing what new choices will come and how they will work them out. Mari Nakachi  one of the producers  hit on the idea of an early matinee  she said  to capitalize on that pocket of time between school drop-off and pickup. It was an easy sell to the other two producers  she said  who are also mothers. Through word of mouth  outreach to school parent associations  Web sites like workingmom.com and fliers that advertised ""special mom's matinees "" the theater began packing the matinee house. Ms. Nakachi said she thought Cherry Lane was the first theater to offer and market the idea in this way. The concept could catch on because traditionally theater ticket buyers are women 30 to 50  said Maria Di Dia  vice president of the League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers. ""The industry is playing with curtain times to get audiences "" Ms. Di Dia said. Broadway's 7 p.m. Tuesday curtain for family shows has become institutionalized after just two years  she added. This year  the Off Broadway show ""Here Lies Jenny"" with Bebe Neuwirth offered three 11 p.m. shows  with much success. ""I think it's a fantastic idea "" Ms. Di Dia said of the 11 a.m. matinee. ""You just need a show that you can market that way. People buy tickets for shows  they don't buy tickets just to go to the theater."" Still  there are challenges to the ""highly unusual"" 11 a.m. matinee  said Jed Bernstein  president of the League of American Theaters and Producers  like educating audiences on its availability  persuading unions and producers to be flexible and not marketing a show so narrowly that it excludes some customers. But  he added  ""any kind of movement to fish where the fish are is welcome."" Last Wednesday  Randi Subarsky from Closter  N.J.  met four friends in the Cherry Lane lobby -- but only after the play had ended. ""My 15-year-old son was sick "" Ms. Subarsky said  explaining why she missed the performance to her buddies  a group of stylish women who met at Syracuse University 35 years ago. (She said she would catch the show later with her husband.) ""I had to make a choice about parenting and watching a show about parenting."" Advertisement ",articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/magazine/romantic-comedy-movies.html,Rom-Coms Were Corny and Retrograde. Why Do I Miss Them so Much? Feature They were the movies most interested in how ordinary people connect. And they’re essentially gone. None Supported by None None None None [Revisit the best actors of 2018] I have no serious rebuttal to any of these objections. They’re mostly true. I’m a single black gay man  and therefore an unlikely champion of the American romantic comedy: What’s in these movies for me? And yet here I am  in a state of panicked rumination: Who are we without these movies? Romantic comedy is the only genre committed to letting relatively ordinary people — no capes  no spaceships  no infinite sequels — figure out how to deal meaningfully with another human being. These are the lowest-stakes movies we have that are also about our highest standards for ourselves  movies predicated on the improvement of communication  the deciphering of strangers and the performance of more degrees of honesty than I ever knew existed — gentle  cruel  blunt  clarifying  T.M.I.  strategic  tardy  medical  sexual  sartorial. They take our primal hunger to connect with one another and give it a story. And at their best  they do much more: They make you believe in the power of communion. This was work determined  across the whole history of cinema  to find something funny about loneliness  curiosity  attraction  intimacy  conflict and rapprochement. So maybe it’s the most featherweight of genres — but maybe it’s also among the most important. This is moviemaking that explores a basic human wonder about how to connect with a person who’s not you. And here we are dancing on its grave. None None I was raised on two great eras of romantic comedies. First was the older  louder  wilder style  from the 1930s and 1940s  built on stars at the peak of their powers: Spencer Tracy shouting at Katharine Hepburn  Katharine Hepburn shouting at Cary Grant  Cary Grant shouting at Rosalind Russell  Rosalind Russell doing things with her posture that made shouting unnecessary. They imagined a certain parity of the sexes  their radical scheme  for the 1940s  was to balance the story between a man and a woman by making the woman formidable and remarkable and alive  in exactly the ways romantic-comedy heroines would later be criticized for not being. Many of them treated this quest for parity as a contest for supremacy  both in the relationship and in the plot. They were full of competition and gamesmanship and verbal battles between the sexes. Sometimes the men in them were a little like hapless  klutzy Henry Fonda in Preston Sturges’s “The Lady Eve”: literally falling for women like Barbara Stanwyck. Sex was rarely far from the surface  but in the ’50s and ’60s it really started to announce itself: The stars seemed either made of all the sex in the world (the Marilyn Monroes and Jane Russells) or none of it (Doris Day  the great movie virgin  defending herself against Rock Hudson’s length and hair and teeth). And if right now looks bad for the romantic comedy  the frenetic 1970s were almost worse. Some of the movies may have been better — “What’s Up  Doc? ” “Shampoo ” “Annie Hall ” “Starting Over” — but their approach to relationships was cockeyed. The people in them seem to have soured on love stories  and on one another. It was only as movies swelled into blockbusters that the conventional romantic comedy flourished again  repotted inside “Star Wars” and “Superman” and  a few years later  shoved into the Indiana Jones movies and “Ghostbusters.” And the old battle-of-the-sexes plot came back in two adventure fantasies Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner made together in the first half of the ’80s. This was the other period I grew up on  a modern gloss on the classic style: Holly Hunter over- and outthinking William Hurt  Susan Sarandon tying Kevin Costner’s tongue  Goldie Hawn squaring off against Burt Reynolds or Kurt Russell. Romance was giving in to 1980s corporate fever  and expanded to obsess over work and the workplace — in “Tootsie” and “Baby Boom ” “The Secret of My Success” and “Working Girl.” The stakes were bigger than companionship  the romance was  in part  with the office  and what it meant to be a woman working in one. In 1988  two of the five Best Picture nominees at the Oscars were romantic comedies: “Broadcast News” and “Moonstruck.” So  arguably  were two of 1989’s: “Working Girl” and “The Accidental Tourist.” None To watch this movie now is to appreciate its traditionalism as a romantic comedy  one that would set the template for an explosion of them over the coming years. These movies know they’re best left to stars — that the fun of them is in the chemistry of  say  Richard Gere and Julia Roberts or Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler bringing out the best in each other — and the people who made “When Harry Met Sally” knew that Meg Ryan was a star  this buffet of bewilderment  surprise  wonder  self-assurance and overreaction. Her faked deli orgasm is still up there with Sonny’s getting whacked at the tollbooth and the baby carriage bumping down the staircase in “The Untouchables” — the famous passage that’s always more perfect than you remember. Dollar for dollar  she might trail Roberts as the biggest romantic-comedy star of that second boom. And yet nobody symbolizes the hazards of these movies better than Ryan does. She made about seven more of them  three with Tom Hanks  falling in more movie love than almost any of her peers. But the longer Ryan (and Roberts  and eventually Sandra Bullock and Barrymore) stayed in romantic comedies — and the longer romantic comedies kept rearranging the same tropes into new configurations — the more their personas seemed to smell a rat. A dozen years of these movies left the fictional Ryan sourly single enough to arrive at “Kate & Leopold” (2001) as a snappish wine guzzler who declares: “Maybe the whole love thing is just a grown-up version of Santa Claus  just a myth we’ve been fed since childhood. So we keep buying magazines  joining clubs and doing therapy and watching movies with hit pop songs played over love montages  all in a pathetic attempt to explain why our Love Santa keeps getting caught in the chimney.” The queen of romantic comedies was now sneering at them. None It made a kind of sense. The present didn’t look great. Ryan seemed wiped out by the genre that made her a star  for about the same reasons real-life women were exasperated by modern romance. All the good men were either gay  taken or from the 19th century. None None The drawbridge had given way to separate locker rooms. On-screen  women were doing more on their own  often in what people wrote off as “chick flicks.” Men did the same  in what we called “bromances.” On a show like “Sex and the City ” straight men aren’t really the women’s social peers (their male friends are gay) or equal concerns of the plot — they’re distant objects to be dissected and taxonomized  puzzled over and tested. (Other romances were really about the woman  the guy she fell for was just a placeholder for a desirable mate  an Easy-Bake man like the generic trophy girlfriends male protagonists have always won at the end of comedies.) Across the hall  in the men’s room  were buddy movies like “Wedding Crashers ” “I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry ” “The Hangover” and Judd Apatow’s comedies  like “Knocked Up” or his glorious “The 40-Year-Old Virgin.” These movies feel a little like romantic comedies  but they exist almost entirely in a male world suspicious of women — they’re tricky to deal with  likely to judge or nag  good for encouraging maturity but too mature for fun. Suddenly  homosocial relationships seemed preferable to heterosexual ones. None None None None None None None The great thing about the drawbridge is that anybody can wind up on one. We might be readier to return to it than we know. In the past three years  we’ve made hits of downbeat love stories like “Moonlight” and “La La Land” and “A Star Is Born.” Maybe that’s where we are right now: pragmatic  skeptical  in the mood for romantic tragedy  just like that previous ebb in the ’70s. And yet I can’t go a week without a website  magazine or entertainment show shooting its confetti canon over some romantic comedy’s anniversary or staging a reunion with its stars. But why are we going back to 1876 when the movies can just make more — funnier and crazier and browner and gayer ones? When they do  they should give Katherine Heigl a call. Maybe she wasn’t done with them either. Advertisement ,articles/movies

Imran Khan plays Rahul  an architect so uptight that he irons his socks. Kareena Kapoor is Riana  a free-spirited hairstylist. Both are from Mumbai but trying to make it in Las Vegas. One night Rahul drinks shot after shot to prove to Riana that he’s not a stiff. This being Vegas  they wake up the next day married. On order: an annulment. The first-time director Shakun Batra  who also had a hand in the script  doesn’t pile on subplots. (The movie is an audience friendly 1 hour 50 minutes.) He also doesn’t overdo the mismatch comedy of: I hate you  I hate you  I love you. Rahul and Riana become friends and allies  not squabbling enemies  and the film  which ends with the annulment  leaves open what happens next. (Smart money’s on true love of course.) The minor characters here can be cartoonish (two thumbs down for Rahul’s succubus ex-girlfriend)  but Ms. Kapoor and especially Mr. Khan avoid that fate. And they help make Las Vegas go down a bit more easily. None They don’t quite square with a movie that satirizes Rahul’s awful arriviste parents whose sleek home in Mumbai  where the film lands in the second half  might as well be Las Vegas. But the well-worn  ramshackle Mumbai apartment where Riana’s family lives  radiates chaotic well-being. It’s a relief to spend some time there. Advertisement ,articles/movies

The folky settings made the songs even more approachable. “Skin” was a gently strummed depiction of a night spent dancing  “where there’s no need to talk because the music is so loud ” and the loneliness that follows it: “You can get out of this party dress/But you can’t get out of this skin.” And “July ” with Mr. Erarslan playing hovering lines on a lap steel guitar  was a promise of sanctuary:  All the falls and flights All the sleepless nights All the smiles and sighs They brought you here They only brought you home. Boy’s songs may be destined for romcom soundtracks  they are determinedly benign. “Boris” — in which a leering man notes “Your boyfriend is out of town” — works up the only bit of rancor  with the singer replying  “You should get out of town too.” Yet for all the kindliness in the songs  Boy rarely simpers or resorts to clichés.

https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/movies/when-harry-tries-to-marry-by-nayan-padrai-review.html,Longing for Marriage Advertisement Supported by None Calling your romantic comedy “When Harry Tries to Marry” is a no-win proposition. Producing smarm at the high level of “When Harry Met Sally” requires special talent  and when you fall short all you’re left with is garden-variety smarm. Nayan Padrai’s “Marry” starts with a premise sturdy enough to support a decent comedy. Harry (Rahul Rai)  a 22-year-old Indian-American college student and virgin  is determined to have (and save himself for) an arranged marriage to an Indian woman. His parents had a “love marriage” and it didn’t work. Complicating matters is his flame-haired study partner  Theresa (Stefanie Estes). Will he or won’t he? Can a man and woman just be friends? We won’t give away the disappointing answer  but rest assured it’s delayed long enough to allow for several colorful Indian wedding scenes. Getting that far requires some patience. The judgmental  stand-offish Harry is such a drip you don’t want either the American friend or the Indian bride (Freishia Bomanbehram) to have to settle for him. The larger problems are the usual ones for low-budget romcoms: haphazard plotting  clumsily staged and overly broad comedy (one excruciating  “Porky’s”-level scene involves an unwanted erection) and clunky dialogue. (In the tortured metaphor department  we get: “How do you run from the things that run through your mind? The faster you run  the faster they run after you.”) Some of the actors acquit themselves well  particularly Ms. Estes  who appears to be in a different and better movie. Viewers might note the scene in which Theresa takes two identical photos of herself and Harry  one for each of them — with her iPhone. It’s a head scratcher why she takes two  until you read in the production notes that Mr. Padrai and Ralph Stein began working on the script in 1998. “When Harry Tries to Marry” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Language and sophomoric sexual humor. WHEN HARRY TRIES TO MARRY Opens on Friday in Manhattan.

https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/opinion/sunday/the-economics-of-suspense.html,The Economics of Suspense Advertisement Supported by Gray Matter None IMAGINE the following situation. After a grueling day at work  you plop down in front of your TV  ready to relax. Your TiVo has recorded all of the day’s March Madness games. You’ve sequestered yourself away from any news about who won or lost. Which game to watch?  Suddenly  your spouse pops in and tells you to stay away from Villanova versus Lafayette  which was a blowout  and to watch Baylor versus Georgia State  a nail-biter. Is this recommendation appreciated? Hardly. Baylor versus Georgia State was exciting because the unexpected happened: It was a back-and-forth affair in which Georgia State  the underdog  clinched the upset only in the final moments. But if you know in advance that it’s a nail-biter  you will expect the unexpected  ruining the surprise.  It’s a lesson that the filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan  for one  seems to have missed. Once it’s common knowledge that your movie will have a dramatic  unexpected plot twist at the end  then your movie no longer has a dramatic  unexpected plot twist at the end. To be thrilling  you must occasionally be boring. None We began our analysis by noticing a certain similarity. In a number of settings — watching basketball games  reading mystery novels  gambling in a casino — people are invested in learning the outcome (which team will win  who is the murderer  will I walk out flush or broke)  but they do not wish to learn the outcome too quickly. In all of these settings  a key aspect of entertainment is the revelation of information over time. Information revealed over time generates drama in two ways: suspense and surprise. Suspense is experienced before the fact  when something informative is about to happen. Think about a baseball scenario: bases loaded  full count  two men out. We say that a moment has a lot of suspense if there is a lot of uncertainty about what you will soon think about the outcome. Surprise  on the other hand  is experienced after the fact. We are surprised if something unexpected has just happened. Think about a soccer goalie scoring from a goal kick. We say that a moment has a lot of surprise if your belief about the outcome is very different from what you thought a moment ago. Once these concepts are formalized in this way  the question of how to maximize entertainment — that is  how to generate the most suspense or the most surprise — becomes a mathematical problem that can be tackled on a whiteboard. The solution yields some simple insights (for example  remember occasionally to be boring) but also many nuanced ones.  For instance  to maximize suspense  a mystery novel should have no more than three major plot twists on average. Of course  that last qualification is crucial: The exact number of plot twists should be unpredictable. We can also determine how a change in rules (in a card game or a sport) would have an impact on entertainment. In the context of casino gambling  our computations show that eliminating the ability to split and double-down in blackjack would reduce both suspense and surprise.  In sports  elimination tournaments like March Madness are seeded so that the top two teams are expected to meet in the final. But top seeds may be eliminated early on. That’s exciting when it happens  but that excitement comes at the cost of a less dramatic final. Could it be more exciting to have the top seeds play in the first round  then let the other teams compete for a chance to unseat the victor? Our analysis shows that this rule change would increase the overall surprise value of the tournament but would have ambiguous effects on suspense.  Playoff series in baseball feature an intriguing trade-off. The longer the series  the less consequential each individual game is. Imagine the tedium of a best-of-99 series. On the other hand  if the series is too short  then there is too little time for the suspense to build.  We found that the typical five- or seven-game series works well because it allows uncertainty about the eventual winner as well as large swings in the likely outcome with each passing game. In general  the more evenly the teams are matched  the longer is the optimal series. Academic analysis of the determinants of entertainment is in its infancy. Future work  whether built on information theory or not  should help us better understand why we are moved by certain sports  novels and games. This might help us design better entertainment. More important  it will lead us to better understand the human psyche. Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/arts/design/detroit-institute-of-arts-copes-with-threat-of-art-selloff.html,The Agony of Suspense in Detroit Advertisement Supported by None None For months now  the institute has found itself confronting a threat never experienced by another American museum of its size and not of its own making: the possibility that parts of its world-class collection will be forcibly sold off to help pay billions in debt owed by the city  now in federal bankruptcy. None But these days  the sense of peril surrounding this 128-year-old museum is real and unrelenting. Only a day before the protest  the institute had to close unexpectedly because of a power loss in the area caused partly by city equipment failures. Its registrars and art handlers are hauling hundreds of artworks out of storage in preparation for an appraisal now under way by Christie’s auction house  which was hired by Detroit’s emergency manager to determine how much the museum is worth as a city asset. Board members worry about a prolonged hiatus in gifts of art and money as donors wait out the bankruptcy case.  None And in addition to the time  there is the money drawn from a rainy-day repair fund to pay for lawyers who are exploring legal options  should a sale of art be demanded Appropriating a quotation from the actor John Cleese in the 1986 movie “Clockwise” — “It’s not the despair  Laura. I can stand the despair. It’s the hope.” — Mr. Beal said: “We can take the threat. It’s the uncertainty we can’t stand. It’s the uncertainty that is clouding everything we do.” None But the worry among many of the institute’s board members and supporters is that as the bankruptcy case drags on  and hard choices have to be made  sharper ideological battle lines — art versus pensions — will begin to be drawn  putting the institute into a deeply uncomfortable public position. “I’m an old European socialist ” said Mr. Beal  who was born in Britain. “I would do anything I could for pension-holders and their problems. But those problems have nothing to do with the D.I.A.” Board members are particularly worried about a prolonged interruption in donations toward building the institute’s relatively small operating endowment  now at just over $100 million. And while gifts of art still seem to be coming  “donor comfort has been seriously eroded by the current apparent threat to the integrity of the collection ” the museum’s press office said. The institution is in a particularly vulnerable situation because it  unlike many other large art museums around the country  is owned by the city. But the threat to the collection  which some experts speculate could be worth more than $2 billion  has alarmed museum and nonprofit officials around the country. “In the world of the great museums  this is unprecedented as far as I know ” said Ford W. Bell  president of the American Alliance of Museums. “It just doesn’t happen.” He added: “Our tradition in this country is that artworks are held in trust for the public good  and you can’t have it both ways. You can’t say the works are held in trust until we decide they’re an asset  and we need to sell them. If it worked that way  no one would ever give works to museums  and we wouldn’t have the great collections.” Detroit’s collection  built during the city’s economic heyday as the world’s automotive capital  is particularly strong in American paintings and includes several masterpieces by artists like Bruegel  van Gogh and Diego Rivera. The intense attention drawn by the institute during the upheaval has yielded some unexpected benefits. Attendance during the summer was up  73 610 in July and August compared with 66 057 in the same months last year  there is no direct evidence that the bump was caused by the publicity  but museum officials said they believe at least some of it was. Philanthropic sponsorship of exhibitions has also remained strong  and the shadow of the bankruptcy case has not altered the museum’s calendar of exhibitions  which extends several years into the future. But after so many decades of dissolution in Detroit  a kind of fatalism about the museum’s chances prevails among many. Ray Stanczak  a longtime city resident who showed up to watch the start of the dragon-and-fire protest at an industrial garage north of downtown  said he hoped the museum remained intact.  But he added: “The public trust was betrayed in so many ways here a long time ago. This is going to sound really cynical  but I think maybe the best thing that could happen would be for some of the D.I.A. to be sold off  so it would wake people up to how completely out of whack the priorities are here and in a lot of the rest of this country.” Museums regularly sell minor artworks in a curatorial culling process  using the proceeds to acquire other pieces. But a forced sale of even a portion of the institute holdings to help pay off city debts would do more than leave a hole in the collection.  None “Any sale would start what I describe as a nonprofit controlled liquidation ” Mr. Beal said. None “People need to understand that this is so much more than a Matisse in a museum ” he said. “It’s a piece of American history.” Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/13/heisman-suspense/,"Heisman Suspense None None Comments are no longer being accepted. For my family in Gainesville – I’m rooting for Tebow. Tim Tebow is clearly the lead here. He has proven to stand tall in the saddle in the toughest and most diverse conference. Just to stay healthy in such a competitively defensive conference speaks for itself. His
                                            maturity on and off the field is also to be noted. Tim Tebow is obviously the best choice for this much desired Heisman Trophy. All three are worthy. No matters who wins  there shouldn’t be any complaints. As my father is a former blocking back for the Sooners…I would have to say Bradford all the way. The offensive stats piled up by OU with Bradford at the helm will be a very important factor. Sam Bradford has got to win the award. He leads the best offense in the country and has put up more Touchdown and more Yards than either of his competitors. To me the choice is pretty clear cut. None Tebow will get the most first place votes  but will not win. It is too bad because he is clearly the one with the most impact. There is only one deserving winner: Shonn Greene of the University of Iowa. This young man of great talent and character has been sadly overlooked. He by far outclasses the celebrities from flashier schools. I feel dubious about the final three. Too many times it recognizes the performance of a team and at least two of the candidates are basically riding on the success of there team. Based on how some of these winners
                                            have performed in the pros  it may be better not to win it. I am a big fan of the Gators and i am rooting for Tebow Colt McCoy beat Oklahoma on a neutral field and his stats both running  passing (yards  rating and completion percentage) trump Tim Tebow=the Heisman. Both Tebow and Bradford are great quarterbacks  but this year 
                                            Colt “the Gunslinger” McCoy helped his team in every offensive category to a 12-1 record. None The quarterback led the team in rushing yards. It is that a tribute to the quarterback. Or an indication of an offensive deficiency. Don’t get me wrong  he was impressive. But the rushing stat did not impress. I think Bradford will win it and then be humbled in the BCS title game by the Florida defense and what Tebow does to the Sooner defense. Bradford had two 1 000 yard rushers to open up the passing game and the big stats for him. McCoy led his team in rushing and led his team to victory over OU. Tebow is great  but his stats are mediocre and he already
                                            has a Heisman. Easy choice  McCoy. My vote goes to Texas  thanks to the collective efforts of Colt McCoy and Colleen Cody  the gorgeous blond cheerleader who has led the entire season in rushing – that’s blood rushing through the hearts
                                            of a million guys  the most touchdowns – every time she catches her pom-poms she scores  and the highest rated player with a 13 out of a possible 10. Yay McCoy! – given her skills and your QBi-ng 
                                            how can you possibly lose? Tebow for the HE15MAN! Boomer Sooner! Congratulations to Sam Bradford. He did really good this season. I do however feel as if Tim got messed over. He was highest in first place votes but was not able to win. that makes a WHOLE lot of sense.  It will all be okay though  he is a wonderful role model and a great person that everyone should look up to him. hopefully UF will be able to pull out for the National Championship!! None Tim Tebow by not winning the Heisman this year  will be motivated enough to de-bone the Sooners in the BCS Championship Game.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/books/review/ruth-ware-the-lying-game-guilt-suspense.html,Suspense Fiction That Mines the Terrain of Female Guilt Advertisement Supported by The Shortlist None None Pretty  clever  restless and ethically blank  Natalie hits on a scheme to pilfer from the customers of NuLine Telecommunications  where she registers payments behind a “frosted partition.” All she needs to do is marry someone whose last name starts with a T and she can sign over all the checks made out to “N.T.” to herself. And so Moggach’s marvelously tricky novel embarks on its exploration of this ruse’s many surprising repercussions — for Natalie and others  including the hapless momma’s boy she weds because he has the right initial and the various victims of her seemingly victimless crime. Moggach offers the twists of a proper suspense thriller  but she knows that her job is also to entertain along the way. So she peoples her story with complex characters and witty observations on their cramped  disappointing lives in the industrial English city of Leeds. A sad highlight of Natalie’s previous 32 years was a one-night stand in the ’90s with a rock ’n’ roller who misspelled her name on a morning-after publicity photo. “The guy might be dyslexic ” she shrugged. Now she’s moved on to bigger things  and thrills — to “the buzz of crime  the kick of it. She felt fizzingly alive to her fingertips.” The novel’s sharply drawn characters bring another payoff. While some thrillers tick off a checklist of red herrings on a predictable march to the finish  Moggach’s creations  with their layered personalities and shifting motivations  throw more guesswork into the mix. And something to ponder  too: matters of morality  complicity and fate. None The prologue serves notice that one of two sisters will die in the course of Ellwood’s novel. Beyond that  all is gloom and confusion under the sway of a narrative voice muddled by drink  drugs and post-traumatic stress disorder. Kate Rafter suffers from the effects of all three after a horrifying stint as a war reporter in Syria. She’s returning to her childhood home on the coast of England with enough baggage to fill a beat-up rucksack and at least two or three thrillers. Within a few chapters  Kate undergoes a psychiatric evaluation after harassing a neighbor she suspects of harming a little boy no one else can see. Meanwhile  she ruminates over the wreckage of her life: the demise of a romantic relationship  an unhinged attack on a coworker  the death of her mother  a family history of domestic abuse  a sister’s paralyzing alcoholism  the mysterious long-ago drowning of a baby brother. And then there’s the suspicion that something creepy is going on in the garden shed next door. Unless Kate’s imagining it. The only certainty is that everything can’t possibly be as it seems. “I am on the edge of it all ” Kate concludes  “a ghost with no foundations  no roots.” While Ellwood serves up some action  most of the revelations emerge from memories that eventually crystalize amid the fog. They proceed from an intriguing central motif: that PTSD can render a narrator unreliable and deliver the confusion necessary to tangle a plot. None Ephron’s mystery is surprisingly gentle  considering the potentially disturbing subject matter at its core. A 4-year-old girl vanished 40 years ago from a town on the South Carolina coast. Three generations of women unite to search for her when a clue resurfaces — a damaged porcelain doll  possibly one that had been handcrafted as a portrait of the child and went missing along with her. Miss Sorel  the girl’s mother  is the master crafter who made the original doll. Now her elder daughter  Lis  and granddaughter  Vanessa  join her to sort through leads while tending the layers of guilt and sorrow that burden their family. The setting promises some Southern gothic atmosphere — Ephron describes the odor along the Bonsecours River  “thick with the pungent  slick  gooey pluff mud that was exposed by a receding tide” — but there’s little sense of menace or imminent danger. Fans of zingier thrillers might wish the big moments in this one popped with more drama. A ceramic kiln for dollmaking explodes  but we learn about it second-hand  after the fact. A valuable doll collection disappears when no one is home. Some tires may have been deflated. Ephron aims for readers who favor milder entertainment  leaning toward novels in which the writing is straightforward and the plot spools out at measured pace. The appeal here lies in her portraits of the women  who rely on their doggedness and emotional bonds on a mission to restore the family peace. None A single cryptic text  “I need you ” reunites four friends in the stippled light of an English seaside village just as surely as it signals readers that they’re in the hands of a pro. Ware sets her psychological puzzle in a crumbling old mill on the Reach  where a marshy river meets the glimmering sea. It’s the home of Kate  who summons her old friends Isa  Thea and Fatima when the discovery of a human bone in the shifting sand threatens to reveal misdeeds from their boarding-school days 17 years earlier. Ware further complicates the guessing game with the disclosure that the teenagers once played a game of their own invention  awarding points for telling convincing lies to taunt their classmates. Now the former clique must separate truth from deception as the stakes ratchet higher amid the growing possibility that someone close to them has committed murder. “A lie ” says the narrator  Isa  no slouch at the game. “I’d almost forgotten how they feel on my tongue  slick and sickening.” Capable as she is  Ware hasn’t worked out all the kinks of believability. Would Isa  a hyperprotective new mother  keep returning to the creepy mill with her baby as threats mount  the electricity fails and the sea threatens to swallow any route of escape? But for the most part  “The Lying Game” makes good on its premise that tall tales have consequences  especially when they’re exposed to the glare of truth. Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/garden/shopping-for-chandeliers-with-sara-story.html,Master of Suspense Advertisement Supported by Shopping With Sara Story None WHEN Sara Story is looking for light fixtures  her feeling is  the bolder  the better.  “I’m always willing to take more of a risk with a light fixture than I am with a fabric color or wallpaper ” she said  noting that her clients often tell her that the fixtures she chooses for them are their favorite thing about her work.  And when it comes to chandeliers  drama is even more important.  Ms. Story  40  an interior designer in Manhattan  likened a chandelier to “a piece of sculpture or jewelry” for a room that also happens to provide illumination and ambience. “You could do a really quiet room and just have this spectacular chandelier ” she said. “And the balance will work very well.” In Ms. Story’s world  chandeliers aren’t limited to the traditional cluster of crystal. There are many other materials  colors and shapes that offer a variety of looks. But choose carefully: a chandelier “gives a place so much character ” she said  and invariably has a major impact on a room. At Artemide in SoHo  she pointed out the Mercury LED suspension lamp by Ross Lovegrove  which appeared to dangle a handful of silvery pebbles in midair. Describing its futuristic look as “very spaceship ” Ms. Story said it would be an unexpected choice for a dining room  and would be particularly well suited to a large space. Just up the street  at Design Within Reach  she picked out the Modo 10-globe chandelier by Jason Miller for Roll & Hill. “It’s edgy and chic ” she said  admiring the way its sticklike frame spreads out horizontally to give it a strong presence in a room. At Flos  she stood transfixed by the Nebula fixture by Joris Laarman  made with 10 blown-glass cones of varying sizes that “almost look like big speakers ” she said. “I just want to stare at it.” Ms. Story often uses vintage chandeliers in her projects  so she also stopped at Bernd Goeckler Antiques in Greenwich Village  where she admired the many midcentury fixtures before settling on a favorite: a 1950s brass suspension light by Angelo Lelii for Arredoluce  with bright red  blue and yellow shades on adjustable gooseneck arms.  But not everyone  she acknowledged  is ready for such unconventional chandeliers. For those who are hesitant about committing to an ultramodern fixture  Ms. Story recommended the Veronique Linear 14 by Steven Sclaroff  at Remains Lighting.  “It’s a contemporary take on the traditional chandelier ” she said. In other words  a dramatic choice  but not a risky one.  TIM McKEOUGH Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/style/possessed-trousers-with-a-sense-of-suspense.html,POSSESSED  Trousers With a Sense of Suspense Advertisement Supported by POSSESSED None IT'S not often that a turn at go-go dancing helps pave the way to fame  usually it's a step on the road to ruin. But the infectiously brazen show Jake Shears puts on as the lead singer of Scissor Sisters puts quite the dent in that wisdom. During a stint stripping in a New York nightclub  Mr. Shears learned something that most of his peers have not: when it comes to getting a crowd going  a ragged T-shirt -- the default setting of today's rock costume department -- does not go far. Taking a page from over-the-top styles like punk  glitter and heavy metal  Mr. Shears dresses up  not down  to go on. ''I wouldn't be comfortable going onstage in a T-shirt and baseball cap '' he said. ''I wouldn't be Jake Shears.'' Actually  the 25-year-old singer  whose real name is Jason Sellards  rarely wears anything at all above the waist. But wait  there's less. Mr. Shears's 27-inch waist  reminiscent of Iggy Pop's lean form  dares even pants to stay on. At a performance this spring  a tartan toga  which had been inching precariously toward catastrophe  finally came off during the band's bows. Oops  how'd that happen? ''I'm a total exhibitionist '' Mr. Shears explained happily. His style has even taken him to that final frontier where most men will never boldly go: the women's racks  where there are not only smaller sizes but often more interesting clothes. A Los Angeles thrift shop yielded a pair of women's leather patchwork hip-huggers that  trim as they are  have to fight valiantly to stay up. With his favorite trousers  Mr. Shears does not take any chances. ''If I didn't wear suspenders  my bits would be falling out '' he said. The garment  a pair of women's striped knee-length pants  which are held together  barely  with leather straps up the sides  was unearthed at the London headquarters of Vivienne Westwood  who designed them. (Ms. Westwood had invited the five band members to pilfer the archive.) ''They were kind of hidden on a little rack '' Mr. Shears said. ''I pulled them off  and it was love it at first sight. They are totally me. I feel very strapped in. It's a great feeling  like I can do anything.'' While they expose plenty  the pants  which look like the breeches of a very racy pirate  have held their own on tour this summer. ''They're totally linked in with it all '' he said  ''with stripping and go-going  that urge to jump around and say look at me and act like a fool and just get my ya-ya's out.'' Though they were designed for the last spring collection  the pants are not especially feminine. ''What I look for in clothes is something that celebrates sex '' said Mr. Shears  who wears jeans and a T-shirt offstage. ''I revel in male sexuality  and I don't think men put themselves out there as sex objects.'' If they did  he suggests  shopping would be easier. ''I am not crazy about trying on women's clothes '' he said. ''I love when I find a great pair of men's pants. The problem is  men's clothes are usually really boring.'' This month  the band's debut album  ''Scissor Sisters '' reached the No. 1 spot on the Billboard electronic and ''heatseeker'' charts. And as Mr. Shears becomes known less for his body than for his voice  a synthesis of Elton John  Mick Jagger and a Gibb  he is shopping for more demure trousers  even a shirt or two. '' 'Mary ' the next single  is being released here '' he said  speaking from London  where the band  though American -- Mr. Shears grew up in Seattle -- has its biggest following. ''And I'm hardly going to sing it on ''Top of the Pops'' in my slutty shorts.'' It doesn't matter what he wears. Sooner or later  as his fans know  it's coming off. Advertisement ,articles/movies

Kind of a harrowing premise already  right? Noah has always been a handful. He throws epic tantrums to avoid bathing  wakes up screaming at night and panics at the idea of being left with a babysitter. “It was just part of Noah’s uniqueness.” Like any mother  Janie is a little slow on the uptake when it comes to the apple of her eye. The thing is: He’s creepy. The kid spouts facts on subjects he hasn’t learned about and knows things about places he hasn’t been. “When is my other mother coming?” he asks Janie. Noah’s preschool is so freaked out by his increasingly bizarre behavior that Janie is forced to get him professional help. After visits to many doctors  Noah is offered a mental health diagnosis and medication. But Janie turns to a higher power: Google. And she comes across a theory that might explain everything. Could it be that her son is remembering a past life? Desperate  she reaches out to an eminent researcher  Dr. Jerome Anderson. This sounds ludicrous. And it shouldn’t work. But Guskin pulls off the silly premise with a gripping  deft and moving mystery. Did Noah have a previous life? Was he murdered? And where is his “other mother”? Anderson has his own motives for studying Noah. Recently given a diagnosis of aphasia  he’s racing to finish a book of case studies before the dementia takes hold. Noah remembers more than he should  Anderson less and less. They’re both learning to let go. None Husbands can be the source of a lot of stress. Take Jean’s husband  Glen  who just got knocked down by a bus outside Sainsbury’s. “Head injuries  they said. Dead  anyway.” But being a widow rather than a wife suits Jean just fine. And no wonder. Turns out Glen was the prime suspect in a missing child case that captivated all of England. Glen insisted he was innocent. Jean stood by him. Much tea was consumed. The detective assigned to the case — “a straight up-and-down copper. . . . One of the last” — believed Jean knew more than she let on. So naturally  the reporters “sitting outside the house in their cars  Big Macs in their fists ” have been scrambling to get her story. What did Jean know  and when did she know it? Kate Waters  one of those reporters  thinks she’s finally going to get to the truth when Jean agrees to an interview  a “perfect womb trembler.” These days  nothing makes a publisher’s heart go pitter-patter quite like an unreliable narrator who happens to be female. Women! We’re a mystery! Jean is full of contradictions. She’s a fascinating puzzle. “I tried not to blame Glen. I knew it wasn’t his fault. We were both victims of the situation  he said  and tried to keep me cheerful.” She’s both checked-out and calculating. “What else happened that day? . . . They wanted me to make a mistake  but I didn’t. I stuck to the story. I didn’t want to make any trouble for Glen.” Barton knows how to ramp up tension  but when she leaves Jean to focus on the detective and the reporter  the story loses some steam. All three have secrets  and they all lie  but Jean is lying to herself  which makes her far more interesting. None Women fall for the wrong guy even in very nice places like Sweden. They just do it with red wine  long dinners and poems by Mayakovsky. Ester is an aspiring intellectual who finds herself enthralled by an artist/provocateur named Hugo Rask. (“He had made his name combining moving images and text in a way that was considered both magnificent and singular.”) Rask is a big deal. He gives public lectures to adoring fans. His art has made him a celebrity. (It’s Sweden. Just go with it.) He also has the best pickup line ever. “No outsider has ever understood me so profoundly and precisely ” he tells Ester  who falls hard for this poppycock since she’s long on philosophizing and short on sense. Cue intense conversations about the “unifying principles of existence” and the works of Camus. That’s like getting to third base in her crowd  so obviously Ester thinks it’s serious. She’s smitten. There’s some indoor smoking and sex (guess which is more shocking)  but then Rask stops returning Ester’s calls. She doesn’t take the hint. “She was absolutely not going to call him today. She called. He didn’t answer.” Is Rask a cad  or is Ester a stalker? Perhaps the two aren’t mutually exclusive. Andersson (translated by the fantastically named Sarah Death) does a masterly job reeling in the reader. Abstract thinking may make for good philosophizing  but it’s a buzzkill when it comes to relationships. Added bonus: The novel comes with long passages of brainy debate that you can memorize and use to impress friends at parties. None Bohman’s heroine never tells us her name. But we know that she’s young  attractive and underemployed as a hospital cafeteria worker. And that she wants to be a writer. (“I had recently read Dostoyevsky’s ‘Notes From Underground’ and Thomas Mann’s ‘Death in Venice.’ ”) Although she’s taking a break from college for financial reasons  you shouldn’t feel sorry for her. “I found most subjects easy in school ” she explains  “because I am intelligent and have never needed to work all that hard.” She has a plan. In no time  our girl has seduced (or  rather  allowed herself to be seduced by) Carl Malmberg  “Senior Consultant ” a man with both a name and a name tag. Carl is a doctor. He drives a Volvo and serves his wine in expensive Finnish glasses. Our girl is a townie  “programmed by generation after generation of workers” to settle for a menial job. She practically vibrates with class resentment. Let’s just say the relationship gets messy. “If nothing is happening ” she declares  “then you have to make sure something does happen  so that you have something to write about.” The girl might have a book in her yet.

Unhurried  calmly self-possessed  he drifted through “In the Evening (When the Sun Goes Down) ” in an arrangement that subtly acknowledged Big Bill Broonzy and Lightnin’ Hopkins  among other stewards of that song. “It’s so lonesome when your lover’s not around ” he sang in a soft  clear voice  trusting that pitiful line to do its own work. None Mr. Clark  who at 29 is easily the most heralded bluesman of his generation  is a soft-spoken beanpole of a guitarist possessed of rare dynamic powers  including the ability to make a solo feel both effortless and feverish. Over the course of this two-hour show he kept putting together improvised seminars on the importance of pacing  typically overwhelming not with intricacy or velocity but rather something like narrative suspense. His rapport with a growly  in-the-pocket band — the guitarist Eric Zapata  the bassist Johnny Bradley and the drummer Johnny Radelat — was lean and casually deep.

https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/movies/21gate.html,Sex  Blood and Exotica in an Anti-Thriller Thriller Advertisement Supported by Movie Review None I’m fairly certain one reason that the French director Olivier Assayas made “Boarding Gate” is that he wanted to watch the Italian actress Asia Argento strut around in black underwear and punishing heels. And why not? Ms. Argento looks delectable if somewhat demented in “Boarding Gate ” in which she comes across as a postmodern Pearl White  who starred in silent adventure serials like “The Perils of Pauline.” Ms. Argento seems to invite trouble  and Mr. Assayas  who has a way of capturing the seemingly ineffable  has a thing for troubled  troubling women.  “Boarding Gate ” a casually beautiful  preposterously plotted  elliptical thriller  earned little love last year when it played at the Cannes Film Festival  where it was shown out of competition. It didn’t do much for Mr. Assayas’s reputation  at least among some critics  who had been just as eager to dismiss his other recent films  among them “Clean” (2004) and the much-maligned “demonlover” (2002). What “Boarding Gate” did do was reconfirm Ms. Argento as one of contemporary cinema’s most fascinating creatures. Her on-screen ferocity is now generating as much interest as her tattoos  an angel hovers above her pubic bone  and an eye stares out from one shoulder  or the ease with which she sheds her clothes  which explains why I can describe those tattoos with confidence.  In truth  thriller is a convenient but imprecise descriptor for “Boarding Gate ” which resists categorization despite Mr. Assayas’s stated insistence that he was trying (really) to make a B movie in English. Much like “demonlover” this new film plays with various genre codes and conventions  the femme fatale  violence  murder  an atmosphere of danger and dread  but plays with them very differently than most run-of-the-mill modern thrillers. Indeed both films depend on your having at least a passing familiarity with the kind of anonymously produced slick flicks  slickly packaged  slicked with blood  that are an industry staple from Hollywood to Hong Kong. You may not remember the names of these industrial entertainments  but they’re invariably playing on a screen near you.  Despite Mr. Assayas’s interest in genre there is something in him that either rebels against the obvious or is simply incapable of delivering the same-old  same-old movie-packaged fun and death. It seems fitting then that the first and final images in “Boarding Gate” are so blurred you can’t tell what you’re looking at. Yet even after the opening image comes into focus  two men fire guns at an indoor shooting range  you realize you still don’t know what you’re watching. Seeing is believing (something  sometimes)  but seeing isn’t knowing  Mr. Assayas likes to remind us. And so in “Boarding Gate” he racks up one eye-catching incident after another (involving sadomasochistic sex  pooling blood and smuggled drugs) that swirl on screen with little apparent connection. It’s actually easy to make story sense of “Boarding Gate” if you go with Mr. Assayas’s oblique strategies. Ms. Argento is Sandra  the former lover of a shifty  financially struggling American businessman  Miles (Michael Madsen)  who lives  works and plays rough in Paris. An ex-prostitute  Sandra wants to make a new life running a club in Beijing  but she needs money  which leads her back to Miles as well as to a shady couple  Lester and Sue (Carl Ng and Kelly Lin). Murder and mystery lead Sandra to Hong Kong where guns are drawn and discharged. At one point Kim Gordon  the frontwoman for Sonic Youth  shows up  barking orders in Cantonese  a moment of delirium in what has become an increasingly unhinged enterprise. In “demonlover ” which involves corporate intrigue and pornography  sex is a commodity and a spectacle  a means of control and a weapon of power. Business transactions resemble mating rituals  and sexual encounters are as erotic as watching traders skirmish at the Stock Exchange. The sex in “Boarding Gate” is more complicated  partly because Sandra isn’t just a conduit for Mr. Assayas’s ideas  she isn’t simply another of cinema’s overdetermined whores  but also an identifiably real  cringingly human character. “Demonlover ” with its sleek surfaces  slippery ideas and pulp flourishes  is a perfect critical object. But “Boarding Gate ” despite its periodic and self-conscious outlandishness  feels much more tethered to lived experience  which is Mr. Assayas’s great subject.  It can be easy to overlook this investment in real life  but only because the shiny surfaces of his films  with their excesses and putatively exotic locales  are so beguiling and even distracting. “Boarding Gate” certainly offers plenty of visual distractions  the image of Ms. Argento getting down and dirty with Mr. Madsen included. And there is no question that Mr. Assayas  a former film critic for Cahiers du Cinéma  knows full well the commercial value of female nudity and not just its aesthetic charm. That said  even in “Boarding Gate ” a modestly scaled  self-consciously tawdry exercise in genre appropriation  Mr. Assayas manages to say more about what it is to be human  to desire  to fear  to be alone  than most filmmakers say in a lifetime.  As always  it’s easy to be dazzled by Mr. Assayas’s camerawork  the way he catches a person’s movement as well as the volition behind that movement  but watching “Boarding Gate” I was again struck by how he uses music to amplify reality  almost as if he were inviting you to listen to the songs playing in other people’s heads. His use of Brian Eno here is particularly potent. Mr. Eno creates music that drifts around you  enveloping you in moods and waves of feeling  which is precisely what Mr. Assayas does as a filmmaker. Mr. Eno has said that for him making popular music is about “creating new  imaginary worlds and inviting people to join them ” a sentiment that Mr. Assayas no doubt understands. “Boarding Gate” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Rough sex  rougher death.  BOARDING GATE Opens in Manhattan on Friday.

https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/books/review/harriet-lanes-her-and-more.html,Thrillers Advertisement Supported by The Shortlist None None The action in this icicle-sharp British chiller kicks in with an act of civic kindness: A stranger returns a dropped wallet to its owner. Unbeknown to the grateful recipient  an overwhelmed homemaker and toddler’s mom named Emma  the wallet was not in fact mislaid. What’s more  Emma shares a distant history with the well-heeled and effortlessly urbane good Samaritan  Nina  which apparently only Nina recalls. A mother herself (of a drifting teenager) as well as the neglected daughter of a successful composer  Nina acutely intuits Emma’s vulnerability  attributing it to the anxieties and “flat-out invisible drudgery of family maintenance  the vanishing of personality as everyone else’s accrues ” and exploits those tensions with a breathtaking vengeance. The stray wallet is but the first in an alarming series of infelicities that will plague Emma as Nina insinuates herself further into her life  orchestrating domestic chaos under the camouflage of serving as an altruistic friend.  The author proves as crafty as her diabolical Nina  seesawing between the two women’s points of view in a tucked-in manner that sustains and ratchets up an atmosphere of things about to spill. If Lane tends to oversell the Sisyphean moil and toil of maternal responsibilities  that may be a decoy  calculated to allay our suspicion that the beleaguered Emma represents for her stalker something quite other than she initially seemed. This is psychological bait-and-switchery to put on the shelf alongside Patricia Highsmith and Georges Simenon. None When a teenage girl  early in Johnston’s debut thriller  voices sympathy for the cannibalistic fate of the snowbound Donner party  would it be presumptuous to suspect that in due time she’ll be compelled to make some pretty unsavory survival choices of her own? The speaker  a recent high school graduate and champion runner named Caitlin  seems primed for adversity. One feels less sanguine about the self-preservation abilities of her addiction-prone family after Caitlin’s disappearance during a vacation in the Rockies  an event that occurs in plain sight of her kid brother  Sean. Caitlin’s mother descends into pills  while her father  a carpenter hobbled by missing fingers from a drinking mishap  abandons his family to keep vigil at the Colorado ranch of an elderly friend. Sean  palpably traumatized by his failure to keep his sister from harm’s way  develops a rescue complex that gets him into trouble of his own and  together with many other characters  inhales enough cigarette smoke to fog up all seven seasons of “Mad Men.”  Johnston’s descriptive prose attains a level of visceral brio  despite a self-conscious piling on of heartbeat imagery that seems weirdly at odds with all those smoldering cigarettes. While the author periodically checks in on Caitlin’s desperate plight  it’s the men — bullies and stymied heroes alike — who power this engulfing thriller-cum-western  which is at its most potent in the adversarial banter of a couple of guys  sniffing around each other like pit bulls. None Emily and Ben were once tethered at the hip  forming a couple their friends referred to as “Bemily.” Why then  we are compelled to ask in this meandering British aspirant to “Gone Girl” status  did Emily suddenly abandon her adoring husband  their beloved little Charlie and her foursquare life as a lawyer in Manchester to reinvent herself as Cat  a debauched London advertising executive? Could it have anything to do with her emotionally unstable twin sister  Caroline  who slammed a plate glass door in Emily’s face as a child and acts out at weddings like a character in a Lars von Trier movie? Or perhaps it’s fallout from dubious role models: an apathetic  womanizing dad and a mom who simply walked away?  Whatever dark memory is at play  the once decorous Emily is becoming more like her reckless sister with every passing day. Weary readers will root for the inevitable crash: Even after her bad-girl makeover  Emily remains something of a priss. Our patience is further tested by Seskis’s manipulatively zigzagging chronology and chorus of flat-footed narrative voices  tick-tocking between first and third person and freighted with armchair psychologizing and extraneous ­secondary-character back stories. Once the concoction of indiscretions and calamities boils over  laying bare the “Mary Worth” cartoon at the book’s heart  it’s hard not to feel a little giddy. None “Being a mother is like being held hostage ” posits the title character in this thinly veiled riff on the story of Amanda Knox  the Seattle exchange student twice convicted by the Italian courts in the murder of her English roommate  Meredith Kercher. The question driving Darnton’s brisk  goal-oriented chronicle of one mother’s rude awakening is: Who exactly is doing the hostage-taking? Darnton reworks the particulars of the Knox case with a “Law and Order”-style toolbox  moving the locale to Spain and switching the gender of her victim.  When Jennifer Lewis’s 20-year-old daughter  Emma  is implicated in the stabbing death of a male student from the Spanish city of Almería during her junior year abroad  this ex-actress and stay-at-home mother launches into full-throttle defense mode. In the process  she gradually comes to terms with her daughter’s moral shortcomings and the maternal myopia that may have unintentionally contributed to them. Darnton’s dialogue and dramatic devices (which include a would-be romance with an empathetic Spanish private detective) often feel as rote and hard-wired as Jennifer’s supermom reflex. More problematically  Darnton so blurs the line between fact and fiction in reworking choice details of the Knox case (the European boyfriend  the caught-in-the-act-of-kissing photo) that one might be tempted to interpret this fictional reimagining as Knox’s third trial and conviction.

https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/books/review/thrillers.html,Thrillers Advertisement Supported by None There are a lot of ways for a novelist to create suspense  but also really only two: one a trick  one an art. The trick is to keep a secret. Or many secrets  even. In Lee Child’s books  Jack Reacher always has a big mystery to crack  but there are a series of smaller mysteries in the meantime  too  a new one appearing as soon as the last is resolved. J. K. Rowling is another master of this technique — Who gave Harry that Firebolt? How is Rita Skeeter getting her info? The art  meanwhile  the thing that makes “Pride and Prejudice” so superbly suspenseful  more suspenseful than the slickest spy novel  is to write stories in which characters must make decisions. “Breaking Bad” kept a few secrets from its audience  but for the most part it was fantastically adept at forcing Walter and Jesse into choice  into action. The same is true of “Freedom ” or “My Brilliant Friend ” or “Anna Karenina ” all novels that are hard to stop reading even when it seems as if it should be easy. None As far as beach reads go  though  Coben’s are among the best. In “The Stranger” he again takes a happy suburban family and destroys it  which  judging by his sales  is just the frisson that a lot of the members of those families are looking for. This time around his victim is Adam Price  a New Jersey lawyer  one evening  a man approaches Adam with the devastating news that his wife  Corinne  faked her last pregnancy  and worse still that their two sons may not be his. Coben describes Adam’s search for the truth behind these allegations — and the identity of the person who made them — with masterly skill  springing surprises  raising stakes  seamlessly integrating other victims of the “stranger” into Adam’s tale. He’s also a smooth  funny writer. James Patterson chivies his reader along toward his next plot point  but Coben likes to pause and make the kind of ephemeral observation that Ian McEwan so accurately called “one of the writer’s great pleasures” — at a lacrosse game  for instance  Adam thinks of how “we pretend otherwise  but we watch only our own child ” or at another moment  contemplating tragedy  how “the world moves on  which is an outrage.” Still  the real point is the chase. After Adam confronts her  Corinne leaves  and he tries with increasing desperation to pull her back  hoping to salvage their life together. The book’s denouement is enough to make you later to bed than you wanted. And yet throughout  both he and we are more happened-to than happening  waiting on those secrets. When they arrive  of course  they seem diminished in importance  and a day or two after I finished “The Stranger ” I found I had already forgotten many of its particulars. Coben  Child — they get accused of writing the same books over and over. But if each new book makes the reader amnesiac  does it matter? None There’s an enormous technical difficulty with this kind of book: The author must hold the husband in a state of weird suspension throughout  since he’s either (a) a murderer or (b) the victim of terrible circumstances. (Not surprisingly  it was Gillian Flynn who most adroitly solved this difficulty  just one of the innumerable brilliancies of “Gone Girl.”) At the same time  it’s a perfect microscope with which to examine the inexhaustible fascinations of marriage  and as Pitlor flashes between the day of Hannah’s disappearance and Lovell’s uneasy consideration of their past resentments  she finds a nice voice — thoughtful  lyrical  unforced. Because of this  and because it’s a quick  light-footed read  “The Daylight Marriage” ends up just about surmounting its flaws of construction  even its unsatisfying solution. “Oh  my whole life feels like an epilogue right now ” Hannah says in the last fight she and Lovell have before she vanishes  and it’s ambiguous clues like this that keep the reader curious — and perhaps also clarify the popularity of this style of book. Culturally  we’re at a strange moment halfway between the old notions of what a woman’s life can be  and the new ones. Marriage  children  suburbia: Is escape from these things a dream  or a nightmare? None The story tracks James Bond’s creator from Cairo to Tehran across an eight-day period in 1943  when Churchill  Roosevelt and Stalin met  in part to plot the invasion of Normandy. It’s an inspired setting — an astonishing array of historical figures cross the page  from Alan Turing to Averell Harriman to Lavrenti Beria. Fleming  though  is the star. Handsome  sharp and patriotic  he also seems irretrievably wounded by the isolation of his youth at boarding school and the early death of his father. In the book’s crackerjack cold open  which captures an entire certain field of Britishness in a few pages  he gets the news of that death from a sympathetic headmaster  who nevertheless proceeds to beat him with a slipper for a minor infraction. It seems convincing  thereafter  when Mathews has Fleming constantly escape into half-formed daydreams about a spy with a license to kill. None The genre that Bond helped pioneer is at a down moment. As John Updike wrote in 2005  “the spy thriller still pines for the Soviet Union ” and at least from a distance  these days  spying seems to have turned into one more desk job  with fewer dead drops  less chicanery at border crossings  and our country’s murky  awful  transnational enemies perhaps too elusive to provide a foil as compelling as Karla. None At moments  particularly in his depiction of George  a coked-up publicist shanghaied into cahoots with the baddies  Zander handles this material well. He’s a smart  fluid observer — but of what? Like so much spy fiction  “The Swimmer” seems to be a pastiche of a pastiche  its stylishness (as translated from the Swedish by Elizabeth Clark Wessel) borrowed from other authors’ guesswork. A character “lacks the deadly  quicksilver intelligence of a Navy SEAL  so he’s probably Special Forces.” Um  O.K.? If the world of “The Swimmer” is unearned  its twists are nevertheless half engrossing  promising enough that Zander may join the league of novelists currently writing decent espionage stories of the new century  like Olen Steinhauer and Alex Berenson. But it’s hard to care when all of them work so definitely within the same etiolated tradition — epigones of Deighton  le Carré  McCarry. Some genius needs to come along and dissolve this genre  then build it again on the ruins. It was fine when the old spymasters who inspired Zander did it  but I have an appeal to make to the authors of scientific thrillers: Please stop saving the world. For once just save Seattle  or something. None The book’s premise concerns a complex algorithm that can predict global conflicts. The algorithm’s inventor  Jeremy Stillwater  was a brash Silicon Valley wunderkind  now disgraced because his program’s predictions failed. He’s still brash  however  which has cost him the two people he really loves  his girlfriend and her son. It’s them he considers when his program suddenly warns him about a massive impending catastrophe. Could it be right this time? The way Richtel sets up Jeremy’s impossible task  as well as his possible redemption  is good. It’s his enemies that let us down. The fatal moment comes after about a hundred pages: “Of course ” one of the bad guys ruminates  “there is only one book  the Bible  the word.” So  Dan Brown territory. Jeremy pursues these zealots  who are supposed to be tech-savvy  invincible  invisible and legion  though apparently they’re also stupid enough to set up a secret passcode that’s simply an exchange of lyrics from one of Bob Marley’s best-known songs. The book proceeds toward its showdown without the result in doubt. Instead it’s liveliest in small moments — a few brief acidities about start-up culture and many insightful thoughts on technology  for instance the Internet’s power to create “such a huge sample size of language that it betrays what we  the human race  think.” The strong setup and sharp elbows of “The Doomsday Equation” prove that Richtel has the potential to write a blockbuster one day. He might just have to go smaller to do it. None These are so ubiquitous now that writers are obliged to offer some slight wrinkle to the formula  Emily St. John Mandel made “Station Eleven” about a troupe of Shakespearean actors  and drew them so persuasively that they overcame their stale backdrop. (Precisely what good actors should do.) Percy’s idea  too  is agreeably loaded with signifiers: Starting out from a heavily fortified St. Louis  a man and a woman who happen to be named Lewis and Clark go on a long journey toward a possible fresh beginning for mankind. After its portentous start  “The Dead Lands” picks up some speed  and Percy creates sharp  memorable characters  in particular St. Louis’s malevolent mayor. The problem is how waterlogged the whole enterprise is by seriousness. Once you’ve killed off more or less everyone alive  it’s all right to write a brisk story and let the implications of the situation look after themselves. There will be fans of the post-apocalyptic who adore the solemnity of “The Dead Lands ” but to me it seemed — like our planet in the future  it would appear — mostly lifeless. None The diary is convincingly mad  alternatively even-­tempered  hallucinatory and cackling  and complementing it are the retrospective reports of “Jeb ” a sardonic music writer on Jack’s trail. Both characters are too eager to offer the pat reflection that the murders represent a decisive turn toward “modernity ” whatever that is  but the book’s characters are great  its race to capture the murderer is beautifully tense  and it has one of the best twists I can remember in any recent historical thriller. The only reason to avoid “I  Ripper” would be its unforgiving brutality. Some lines  among hundreds of similar ones: “My gloves were heavy with blood and smeared with near-liquid fat. . . . I sawed. I jabbed. I cut off her nose  cheeks  eyebrows and ears.” Is there a utility to this  beyond voyeurism? Looking something horrific directly in the face  I suppose. There’s a common observation that we read thrillers in order to explore the darkness of life safely  thereby negating it. This  rather than mere bloodletting  is probably Hunter’s purpose. He wants to know how humans can do what humans can do  down to the worst of it. Those thrillers that truly transcend their debt to momentum often have that spirit  and it may be that the news of the world these days — the beheadings  the violence against women — has yet to superannuate our need for their bleak exorcisms.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/books/review/night-school-lee-child-and-more-thrillers.html,Six New Thrillers for Fall Advertisement Supported by Fiction None Is there any excuse for a thriller to be well written? A good sentence and a good thriller exist at cross purposes — the sentence making us pause to think or notice  the thriller dissolving our awareness of anything but its narrative  the genre that most wants to make us forget we’re reading. You can find plenty of terrible lines in “The Firm ” but try to track down a boring one. There aren’t any. The field’s current standard-bearer  Lee Child  writes clean  hard and fast. (I once heard at third hand that he aims his prose at a reader of 10 years old  which is one of those things that should be true  whether it is or not.) There’s something genuinely admirable about his style: He’s prominent on his covers  square-jawed and bomber-jacketed  but once the action starts he vanishes  an invisible and discreet servant to his story  indulging in none of the clever asides or descriptions of weather that are so gratifying to a writer’s ego. His books are a little silly  and completely addictive. None “Night School” is the third prequel Child has written with Reacher still in the Army. Fresh off a successful mission  he’s called into a secret meeting by the office of the national security adviser. A tantalizing scrap of intelligence has come into their possession  a phrase that can be plausibly linked to a terrorist cell: “The American wants a hundred million dollars.” Reacher goes to Hamburg to investigate  and for 100 pages or so the book careens forward  drawing the death of a local prostitute and a group of German nationalists into its engaging search. There  however  it stumbles. Child gives away too much  too soon  a rare unforced error for this series  and more significantly Reacher seems strangely out of place in a military investigation. His defining characteristic is his itinerant vigilante solitude  and here  teamed up with elite agents from the C.I.A. and the F.B.I.  handling matters with complicated geopolitical implications  he really feels like the character we know only when he takes a few minutes of me-time to rough up those nationalists. Reacher is a fantasy  of course. When he’s battling a corrupt private military firm  the terse  forceful prose with which Child describes him serves to confirm Reacher’s toughness and credibility. But when he’s battling a jihadist group  that same tone seems (as Theodor Adorno observed that such bids for authenticity often do) like little more than a shrewder variety of fakeness  a subtler posturing. “Night School” is dedicated to “the men and women around the world who do this stuff for real.” If only they existed. None He’s an unhappy fellow  Stephen: He expected Oxford to open new doors for him  but instead found that it only showed him the locked ones more closely. At least his boss  Rollo Buckingham (a name that makes him sound  perhaps a little too blatantly  like Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright’s best chum from sixth form)  has invited him to work on a sensitive internal investigation  the only difficulty is that Stephen has fallen in love with Helen  one of its subjects. None None Their names are Charlie and Matthew  and they are cousins whose friendship dates to their London school days  though both now live in New York. Charlie is rich and married  Matthew poor and at loose ends  obsessively reading his dead father’s copy of Pascal’s “Pensées ” trying to figure out where things went wrong  and so Charlie and his wife  Chloe  invite Matthew to stay for the summer in the guesthouse of their wooded mountainside retreat. From the start there’s a febrile mood to this ad hoc household  languorous poolside mornings  friends coming over to drink a bit too much. Matthew has a secret feeling of closeness with Chloe  not even precisely sexual  which makes her sacred to him  “an idealized composite in whom daughter  sister  cousin  mother  mistress  friend and mystical other half were all miraculously commingled.” When he discovers that she’s being unfaithful  then  he’s bereft. Does he confront her? Charlie? Both of them? There’s something reptilian in Lasdun’s gaze  a coldblooded interest in furtiveness  in the lithe selfishness of the genteel. “The Fall Guy” reads like early Ian McEwan or late Patricia Highsmith  and while often novelists who write as finely as he does seem to feel above what Jonathan Franzen once called the “stoop work” of narrative  Lasdun is masterly in his story’s construction. His clues never seem like clues until they bind tightly around one of the three leads. This is exactly what a literary thriller should be: intelligent  careful  swift  unsettling. Its author deserves to find more readers on these shores. None It begins when he finds a girl floating in the water. Her name is Giulia  “imperious  with straight hair and a sharp chin ” from a rich Venetian family and considerably less dead than Cenzo initially suspects. The Nazis are after her  and very reluctantly the fisherman finds himself conspiring in her concealment. He’s been burned before: His dashing brother Giorgio  a famous actor with friends among the Fascists  stole Cenzo’s wife  who was immediately killed  denying Cenzo even the right to hate her properly. Soon it becomes clear that to save Giulia  Cenzo may have to reconcile with his brother. “The Girl From Venice” is a classy  lightweight affair  agile in its handling of action  smooth in its writing  thoroughly professional. For a long time I couldn’t decide whether it was a passable novel or a very  very bad one. I think  alas  that it’s the latter. The problem is its bone-deep complacency. It’s a book that has completely internalized the lessons of popular war fiction: Heroes are laconic and world-weary  women are redemptive  only nature is “real ” a biplane is always close by to escape on. (There’s an article to be written about the incalculable damage Hemingway has wrought on this genre.) Cenzo falls in love with Giulia  and before long she is “transformed into a fierce little sea nymph ” words are “insufficient” to describe her. “You have no idea how beautiful you are ” Cenzo says. There’s more weight of thought in his feelings about fish than about his new lover  but otherwise they seem roughly equivalent: “Fish were mysterious  more a race than a species  and an invitation to another world.” Of course women can be redemptive. But every gesture of midcentury Romanticism in “The Girl From Venice” is a received one  repackaged and presented as the most profound wisdom. These books come out fairly often — a panful of warm treacle called “Everyone Brave Is Forgiven ” by Chris Cleave  is a recent example — and they make it seem as if popular novelists are just about done actually thinking through World War II  its terrible reality giving way to a comforting set of filmic clichés  sazeracs  desperate train journeys  narrow outwittings. It feels cheap. The Nazis were so cruel individually and in aggregate  so astonishingly malicious  that we owe them our best imaginations. A writer should have to earn them. Anything less is disrespectful to their victims. None In fact  though  the antecedents of “The Vanishing Year” are far older and in a sense more innocent  less laceratingly modern  than Flynn’s magnificent “Gone Girl.” It’s a tale of lost twins  amnesia  agoraphobia  adoption — most indebted  in other words  to melodramas like “Rebecca” and “Wuthering Heights” and “The Moonstone.” (There’s even a Mrs. Danvers clone.) The writing is lively and atrocious. Two instances of the word “harrumph” in a six-page span are at least one and probably two too many. “The picture slides from my mind  slippery as wet spaghetti ” Zoe exclaims at one point  which is a simile with as much literary merit as wet spaghetti. But there can be a great deal of charm in this kind of looseness — “The Vanishing Year” is intimate  conversational company  and its plot is strong  its closing twists superb. In Zoe’s past  we learn  she testified against a dangerous criminal  and before long her new world of fund-raisers and couture is punctured by an attempt on her life. Her husband  who should be her first refuge  grows only more controlling. Instead she turns to a journalist named Cash  who lives in an East Village studio and takes her to his mother’s down-at-heels Queens neighborhood  as so often in tales like this one  status anxiety  the sense that rising in the world must inevitably invite punishment  lurks behind the histrionics. The most human and memorable scenes Moretti writes have little to do with these mysteries  however. They’re the ones that recall Zoe’s childhood adoration of her mother  a loving  fragile person  Sally Bowles in California. The depiction of their relationship seems to come from a different  more tender and less outlandish novel. It would be interesting if Moretti were to write it one day. None “Livia Lone” is divided into chapters labeled “Then” and “Now.” Those in the past are about Livia and her sister  Nason  whose parents sell them to a gang of Thai traffickers. The sexual assaults begin almost immediately  Livia volunteers herself  to protect her little sister. These sections are hard to read  but never gratuitous  and  like the whole book  feel emotionally true at each beat. “She knew she would die if she stopped eating. The thought was immediately appealing.” She forces herself to carry on. Shipped to America  the sisters are separated  and the “Now” sections of Eisler’s book revolve around Livia’s attempts to track down Nason  as well as the men who initially abused them. These have more of the conventional contours of a thriller  verging at moments on the ridiculous  but even here the novel is careful to grant Livia the full complexity of her awful history  the murderousness  the helplessness  the sorrow and the self-loathing that underlie her adult strength. Eisler is an earnest author  kind of nerdy. He likes detail. Almost every thriller has a lead who’s a master of jujitsu  but this one  in some of its finest scenes  actually traces Livia’s slow acquisition of the art  the appeal of the power and surprising friendships it brings her. This is a nice change from the norm  and it’s emblematic of Eisler’s humane and grounded approach to writing a tall tale. His language is clear  unpretentious  a little clunky  a little hammy. Caught up in Livia’s journey  you barely notice it’s there. Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/mo-hayders-wolf-and-more.html,Thrillers Advertisement Supported by Summer Reading None I had the wrong idea about beach books. It came from “Goodbye  Columbus ” where Neil Klugman tells Brenda Patimkin that his cousin Doris always has “War and Peace” by the pool: “That’s how I know it’s the summer  when Doris is reading ‘War and Peace.’ ” Pool and beach being the same to me back then — an idiot kid forced to sit outside with no TV  uncomfortable with my shirt off as my grandfather paraded around to show off he still had a body — I didn’t see that Philip Roth was mocking Doris  and so for years protected myself from the water and sand I resented and feared by lugging along a classic. This is how I read “Swann’s Way” at the Mamaroneck Beach Club as a guest of Uncle Marty and Aunt Lee. It took many visits. Here I would like to thank them personally. But I was ahead of the curve  too. Beach books have gotten bigger  thicker and whompier  no longer such a disposable genre that we’re expected to chuck them in the waves until the day the sea gives up its wretched books. Today  we accept that dark and cursed thrillers  even those suffused with the wintriest of premises  are not antithetical to lying on stolen hotel towels and bragging about where you were accepted to college but decided not to attend. Happily  this summer there are a couple of destined-to-be classics  somewhat fresher than “Buddenbrooks”: Mo Hayder’s “Wolf” and Jo Nesbo’s “The Son.” None Over time  Jack has determined that the Walking Man’s only activity is combing the Somerset countryside in expanding circles whose perimeter he marks with crocuses  their center the spot where the Walking Man’s daughter was abducted years ago. “When he finds an immovable object in his way — a road  a house  a city — he assesses it. If it was there before his daughter went missing  he skirts it. If it was built afterward he does what he can to tear it away and check it hasn’t been built over a grave. He doesn’t care how often he breaks the law to achieve this.” What links Jack to the Walking Man is that both are unable to bury their dead  or their pasts. But when the Walking Man allows Jack to discover his campsite  it is to seal a bargain: If Jack will find the owners of a stray dog with a note reading help us taped to its collar  the Walking Man will provide an important puzzle piece about his brother. Doing endless door-to-doors — “Do you recognize this dog?” — Jack becomes his own walking man  eventually chancing across a home invasion that might connect to the community’s “Wolf murders” years earlier (when 60 feet of intestines were removed from teenagers trapped mid-sex  then used “to decorate the trees above the corpses in the shape of a heart”). “So I did some research ” one home invader comments later  “and what I discovered is that some people are unnaturally attached to the sight and smell and feel of viscera. They love the slime and the blood.” That same gentleman carries an antibacterial spritz everywhere in the huge house they’ve invaded  because “he could smell the accumulation of months and years of badly wiped surfaces.” It should be clear this book gives good grizzle  but it can also be swiftly hilarious. We laugh because we bleed. Anyone who finds the story repugnant is too easily repugged. Hayder’s work and characters are worth the unending nightmares they will inspire. None Of Chief Inspector Simon Kefas  the ostensibly moral center of this stand-alone novel (a break from the esteemed Harry Hole series)  it is said that “he loved Oslo in the summer holidays . . . when it returned to being the slightly overgrown village of his childhood where nothing much ever happened and anything that did happen meant something. A city he understood.” Even the director of the local rehab center suffers from unthinkably Norwegian “compassion fatigue” — until she meets an escaped prisoner named Sonny  anyway  whose police officer father killed himself rather than stand exposed of corruption. That suicide initiates the great trail of confession that engulfs this novel  as the strangely pacific Sonny turns to drugs and starts confessing to crimes he didn’t commit in exchange for money and heroin: “Yes  I killed her. Yes  I’ll read up on how I did it.” (This wry tone is one of the pleasures of the book  or at least of Charlotte Barslund’s translation.) Eventually  though  Sonny learns something about his father that impels him to break out and exact revenge as “the Buddha with the Sword.” Buddha because he had no enemies inside — prisoners used to confess their sins to him. There is no sword. There is Sonny and another man crossing a field hearing the “furious and increasingly loud barking” of caged Argentine mastiffs: “ ‘They think they’re about to be fed ’ said Fidel  but didn’t add: with you.” (Eventually  an answer is posited to a question I’ve always wondered about: What if Jesus got away?) Simon used to be devoted to police work. He even explained once to his much younger wife  Else  how “a crime scene could be beautiful” — how  for instance  “the blood spatter formed a pattern that resembled a teardrop.” Now  though  Else is going blind  and that consumes him: “Last night he had dreamed that he could give up his sight for her. And when he had woken up and not been able to see  he had — for a second before he realized that it was due to the eye mask he wore to block out the early-morning sun in summer — been a happy man.” We like Simon more here than elsewhere. But even this moment of grace has an underside that echoes the detective’s curse: Inevitably  you are almost too willing to un-see what you’ve seen  yet resentful of those who can’t see what you’ve seen for them. In a novel of elaborate  shifting father-son relationships — real and assumed — Nesbo’s most complicated characters seek redemption by spanning their private Vaterland Bridge between old and new Oslo  and their old and new selves. Thrillers are increasingly breaking loose from their genrefication  if that’s a word (and if it isn’t  it should be). This progress mirrors a similar trend in television  where for years now the quality of writing has matched — or vastly exceeded — that of theater and movies. Debased  once-derided genres rule. If F. Scott Fitzgerald were drinking himself to death in Hollywood today  he’d be doing it on the staff of “Justified.” None The best sections of the book take place at the Siberian orphanage where  seeing the baby for the first time  Holly grabs her husband so hard she leaves bruises. It’s a good ominous mom moment. The book is gutsy enough to acknowledge that adoption is not always a gift from the angels and that parents can be as selfish as anyone. When Holly pats her husband’s place in bed beside her and thinks: “Please  God  let him be gone. Let him be gone so I can have a few minutes alone to write ” she is so indiscreetly repellent it’s hard to dislike her. It gets easier once Kasischke starts breaking down the boundaries between reality and illusion  and Holly starts spouting lines comparing Tatty’s “sweet breath” to “fruit? Fruit that had softened under a warm lamp?” It brings to mind Ezra Pound’s advice to T. S. Eliot: “Son  don’t get too poet-y.” Well  that’s what he meant to say  anyway. None Luckily Kestin  a Brooklyn-raised former foreign correspondent  engages us with authentic detail. Special squads of Orthodox Jews carefully comb the area after a terrorist bombing  seeking “bits of brain  an ear  the odd finger  lest these pieces go unburied.” A squadron of Palestinian gliders prepares to approach Israel from a Lebanese cliff. The phones in the police headquarters are all pink — doubtless because someone’s brother-in-law had a crate to unload: I can get your antiterrorism for you wholesale! It may help to be pro-Israel to embrace this book fully. Perhaps some time spent with Matt Rees’s four moving mysteries about the inherited sadness and joy of the Palestinian Omar Yussuf will provide a useful counterbalance. Even so  Kestin’s image of Beirut families in apartment buildings gathered around shimmering big-screen TV’s — “the Westernized equivalent of the Bedouin fire pit” — will stay with you. None Ignatius  a foreign affairs columnist at The Washington Post  has written impressive spy novels for 25 years — eight of them in all  including “Agents of Innocence” and (my favorite) “A Firing Offense ” a newsroom book about a journalist enmeshed with the C.I.A. that rang especially true because Ignatius is a journalist. He has probably never been a hacker  which may explain why “The Director” — about the possibility that the C.I.A.’s computers have been breached — feels more researched than lived  and vaguely cobbled together with materials from his previous  better  book  “Bloodmoney.” The C.I.A. director himself  Graham Weber  is a good guy but a half-putz. His early decision to put the agency’s Internet operations into the hands of a hacker called the Pownzor (“It means  ‘I own you.’ . . . You ‘pown’ someone when you take down his system”) — well  that’s dumb. Hackers hack. When we catch up to the Pownzor strutting around the grounds at Bletchley Park  where Alan Turing and the code breaking lads powned the Nazi’s Enigma machine  we know something bad’s brewing. Here and there  amid occasional hints that hackers are messianic sexual deviants  it’s worth remembering that their culture originally started as a way to copy software the hackers couldn’t afford. In college  I was invited to a dorm room to behold four blind kids making international calls for free just by whistling tones into a phone. It was thrilling. I wish this book had delighted me that way  but I’ll still read anything Ignatius writes. Even Graham Greene didn’t get it right every time. None Quirk is at his best writing about Mike’s family psychology: “As we approached the Fed  Jack looked at me. He always projected a galling confidence  the certainty that no matter how far he went  or what he did wrong  he’d make it through unscathed. But in that moment  after all these years  it had disappeared. I’m ashamed at how satisfying it felt for me to watch it go.” If any theme unites all these books  it’s that we’re all on the run from our fathers and our families  though if we run long enough and far enough we can meet them coming toward us.

https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/14/opinion/thrillers.html,Thrillers Advertisement Supported by On Tuesday night the American Film Institute revealed its list of the 100 most thrilling American movies  selected from 400 nominations by some 1 800 people in the movie business. What those numbers boil down to is the intensely subjective experience of the individual moviegoer  who gladly forks over the price of a ticket and popcorn to sit in a darkened theater and enjoy the esthetic version of a defibrillator's shock. Nearly everyone who loves movies knows the worrisome feeling that begins with the opening credits of ''Alien '' which placed sixth on the list  or the almost unbearable level of tension in ''The Silence of the Lambs '' which placed fifth  or even the need to look away from the screen at the two crucial moments in ''Psycho '' which came in first. In fact  it would not be surprising if most moviegoers found that they had seen more of the movies on this list than on the American Film Institute's lists of greatest movies and greatest comedies. You do not have to be La Rochefoucauld to know that humans love to witness the distress of others when it is being simulated by beautiful women and handsome men under impeccable lighting. But when watching a thriller like ''Rosemary's Baby'' (No. 9) or ''Carrie'' (46)  it is really our own distress that becomes pleasurable. All the emotions we try to keep out of day-to-day living -- tension  anxiety  fear  loathing -- come crowding into the theater with us  and the more we suffer from them while the plot unfolds  the better we can laugh at them when the lights come up. There is no balm quite like the balm of knowing that no matter how scary things get  it will all be over in two hours tops. Yet you can see a movie for the first time only once. That is one of the sad facts of life  especially when it comes to watching thrillers. The next time  you know that the shark in ''Jaws'' (No. 2) eats Quint like a canapé. If there is no recovering that original frisson  there is still such a thing as nostalgic suspense  an affection for the memory of the fresh thrill these movies delivered the first time around. Some of these pictures seem greater in their afterglow than they did when you had to watch them from the edge of your seat. Nearly all the excitement of ''North by Northwest'' (4) has long since vanished. But many of us will go on watching it year after year  if only to be reminded how to wear a suit and how to order dinner on a train and how to flirt in deadly earnest. Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/books/review/thrillers.html,Thrillers Advertisement Supported by None None With that opener  Toyne grabs our attention  and he keeps it. Every answer leads to another question. The amnesiac discovers his name  Solomon Creed  from the inscription in a book he carries  a book apparently given to him by the dead man and written by the town’s founder  a religious prophet. Its enigmatic pages are slowly revealed to the reader  and so is Creed himself. He has encyclopedic knowledge of airplanes  languages  horses  guns  drugs  the physics of a crash site. He can fight like a ninja and diagnose like a doctor. “For a man with no memory  you sure seem to know a lot of stuff ” the sheriff says to Creed. Think of him as Jason Bourne’s weirdo cousin. The book moves so swiftly in part because it’s told roughly in the span of a day  and in part because we’re left hanging and hanging and hanging  the stakes escalating while mysteries pile on top of mysteries. Here’s a sampling of the many cliffhangers that close the chapters: “She . . . stepped into the sanctuary of her home — and stopped dead when she saw what was inside.” “I found blood.” “ ‘Come with me ’ she said. ‘There’s something you should probably see.’ ” “Then the phone clicked and went dead.” Virtually every chapter concludes with some tease of a revelation only to be followed by a chapter from a different point of view  forcing the reader to wait  maddeningly  for an answer. Is Creed an angel or a cartel assassin? Are the sheriff and the mayor in on a scheme to control the town’s trust funds? Who is Papa Tío  the villain who remains offstage for much of the novel’s first half  and why does everyone fear him as though he were the Devil himself? If it’s a familiar setup  it’s also a winning one. This book is almost 500 pages long  and I read it in a two-day fever. None Hawke  as Bell repeatedly reminds us  is the sixth-­richest man in England. He’s also an MI6 troublemaker. He loves Bermudian rum and American cigarettes. He stays cool in a fight and in the torture chamber. He has a yacht  a loyal butler he trades quips with and a sprawling vacation pad in the Caribbean. If it’s not already clear  let me spell it out for you: This novel is a lot of fun  an Ian Fleming-esque romp of a spy thriller. It’s also a bit cheesy. For every stunning jungle ambush and perilous barroom seduction and lightning-lit battle  there are lines like this: “Hold on. There might actually be a way . . . an escape hatch!” And this: “The whole damn world would feel his wrath  his terrible vengeance.” These push the novel out of real-world semi-seriousness and into the cartoonish. The strongest scenes here are the most immediate  written in the first person or from a close third-person point of view. Consider the voice of the retired colonel  Brett Beau­regard  who runs a security company akin to Blackwater: “You see  the whole damn business started with the U.S.S. Cole. The Cole is a serious U.S. Navy warship  mind you. Think billion-dollar baby. . . . She carries a vast array of advanced radar equipment  not to mention her torpedoes  machine guns  Tomahawk missiles and  well — you get the picture. Bad mammajamma.” This is one of many old American male yahoos who bring a rough music to the prose and a strong sense of character to the novel. Strangely  it’s the hero who feels most distant. While the reader is directly housed in the minds of other characters  the psychic distance often pulls back with Alex Hawke. The novel goes into omniscient mode: “Hawke was not a man one could simply glance at and ignore. It was not just his size  his armory of biceps  musculature  rock hardness and the vast reserves of strength these suggested. . . . His blue eyes were startling and had a range from merriment to charm to profound earnestness. Cross him  and he could fire a searing flash of blue across an entire room. . . . Attractive  yes  but it was his What the hell? grin  a look so freighted with charm that no woman  and even few men  could resist  that made him the man he was.” These sections feel like a sales pitch more than a consciousness: I really  really  really want you to buy into Alex Hawke as the new James Bond. Hawke’s world is ours  with the volume turned up. His portly and brainy sidekick  Ambrose Congreve  tells him: “I’m uneasy about the position our American cousins seem to be finding themselves in lately. . . . The military is practically being dismantled  Alex. The borders to the south are nonexistent . . . . China is ascendant  Russia is on a real estate acquisition binge  the Middle East is aflame  and the Americans are setting free the worst of the worst Al Qaeda commanders from Guantánamo.” On this politically sensitive stage  important people are dying: the former director of the C.I.A.  the C.I.A. station chief in Paris  other spies from around the world. Someone is hunting them  making their deaths out to be accidents  and now they’re after Alex Hawke. The investigation and the showdown that follow are only the beginning of the novel’s trouble. The shirtless horseback rider himself  Vladimir Putin  is a character  a onetime frenemy of Hawke’s intent on once more making Russia a superpower. He’s redrawing the map of Europe and developing a new weapon that will change warfare and establish his dominance. There’s good reason to fear Putin’s Russia: the state-­sanctioned attacks on LGBT citizens  the missile-­blasted jet that fell from the sky  the tanks that rolled into the Crimean Peninsula as Putin questioned the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Pundits wonder where he might show military force next — maybe Estonia  maybe Kazakhstan — and how NATO will respond. Storytellers have taken note. If you look at books like Bell’s  shows like “The Americans ” and movies like “Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol” and “A Good Day to Die Hard ” it appears our old familiar baddie is back. Writers are celebrating our move toward a second Cold War with a polar vortex of storytelling. None Sweatshops spring up all across California  since big Chinese corporations find it cheaper to make goods on American soil now that their own workers cost so much. On the roads are convoys of military vehicles branded with the yellow-and-red star of the People’s Liberation Army. At clubs you’ll see corner booths full of “the pampered sons of the Chinese ruling elite who  thanks to the garrison and the attached military academy  had become a fixture of L.A. high society.” Madison (Maddy) Webb is an award-winning writer at The Los Angeles Times. The line between reporter and detective is thin — both jobs putting characters on the streets to seek out the truth — but even more so here  since Maddy is chasing down information about her younger sister  Abigail  who dies suspiciously of a heroin overdose. Think of this novel as a gritty  noirish crossbreed of “Blade Runner” and “L.A. Confidential.” We’re in a future where police badges can be knocked off by 3-D printers  where everyone wears smog masks  where certain cars can drive only on certain days of the week  but the shadowed alleys of Los Angeles are negotiated the way they are in any old-fashioned mystery. Like so many gumshoes before her  Maddy is professionally driven and emotionally cut off. “You’re meant to be this great investigator ” her older sister says  “so brilliant at finding out the truth. But you don’t even know the people right in front of you  do you?” She certainly doesn’t know Abigail. The seemingly innocent elementary-school teacher has high-end clothes in her closet she never could have afforded. And a security video reveals her at a bar with differently styled hair and a strange  pursuant man. Maddy eventually learns that Abigail had ties to the Opium Den  a strip club above a landmark restaurant called the Great Hall of the People  its entrance guarded by green-uniformed sentries in oversize peaked caps and retro People’s Liberation Army fatigues. Other women  all blond like Abigail  appear to have been murdered in a similar fashion  leading Maddy to believe this is the work of a serial killer. It’s appropriate that she has devoted her career to exposing lies and corruption  because this investigation takes her deep into a conspiracy that implicates the rich and powerful. This is an intelligent  finely crafted mystery  a speculative thriller that brilliantly channels the anxieties of our time. None Slim worked as a pimp before becoming the best-selling black American author of his time. His novels — and his memoir  “Pimp: The Story of My Life” — sold millions and helped create a genre known as “street fiction” that gave voice to those who occupied the ghettos and prisons and alleyways. He’s been cited by rappers like Snoop Dogg and the Notorious B.I.G.  as well as Ice Cube and Ice-T (who chose their stage names in tribute). This novel — which he is said to have chosen not to publish because of a disagreement with his former publisher  Holloway House — never stops moving. Cars crash  guns blast  sirens wail  pockets get picked and drugs get snorted. There are lines that made me want to cheer as they capture the sly cornball fun of blaxploitation movies  like this one: “Peace of mind and sound sleep would have been impossible had he known that a psychotic black master pimp would soon arrive in Hollywood.” But there is a fine line between cornball fun and comically bad writing. A pimp refers to his bedroom as a “mirrored ho-trap.” One of his favorite hookers whispers in his ear  “Sweet Master  can I have some bye-bye candy?” He then sucks “scarlet skin berries on her throat” and calls her a “one-track-minded freak-dog bitch” before she unzips his fly and unleashes his “wombstroker.” Can you make a case for Slim as a revolutionary who wrote wild  risky  racially subversive stories? Absolutely. And will some readers try to excuse the ubiquitous misogyny by saying Slim was a brutal truth-teller who wanted to share the ugliness of pimping? Probably. But folks  there’s no excusing “wombstroker.” That said  Iceberg Slim is an important but forgotten writer  and I found “Shetani’s Sister” especially compelling as a historical artifact. He brought a marginalized street vernacular onto the page  and his gritty poetry set the stage for so many writers  filmmakers and musicians. None Dobyns’s sentences make me pause and reread just to roll the words in my mouth  relishing the sound. He’s also very  very funny. “They found the head  but they’re not sure who it belongs to ” a cop named Manny says. “I mean  they know it belongs to the dead guy  but they’re not sure of the dead guy’s name.” And Dobyns is so good at bringing to life the misfits and ne’er-do-wells who populate his pages. Here’s one: “He wears several gold chains and looks like a former bouncer who saved his pennies and bought the bar where he once worked.” And another: “She has too many teeth. He finds them too aggressive  or what he likes to call proactive. And he can’t get past her mustache. It scares him. Women like that throw things.” Yet maybe because humor is difficult to sustain — or maybe because I am an enormous grump — the novel didn’t hold my attention. I marveled at its language and attention to detail  but the constant gags made the story hard to take  well  seriously. Elmore Leonard used comedy to relieve the tension in his crime fiction  but here  as even the title suggests  the jokes feel too much like the hook to hang the narrative on. None “My name is Sebastian Rudd ” the novel opens  “and though I am a well-known street lawyer  you will not see my name on billboards  on bus benches or screaming at you from the Yellow Pages.” Rudd carries a gun. His office is a bulletproof van driven by one of his former clients  a beefy giant once accused of killing an undercover narc. He gets thrown in jail regularly for contempt. He cheats to win cases. He used to be a boxer and now sponsors cage-fighters. He shoots pool and drinks bourbon to unwind. He was a lousy husband  and he’s a lousy father. He takes on the clients nobody else will touch and makes certain they get a fair trial. I’m a sucker for courtroom drama: a cross-examination that leaves a witness babbling through tears  last-minute back-room deals between the defense and the prosecution  surprise revelations  crooked jurors  shouted objections  the high-stakes battle of wits. There are many such scenes here  offset by the action outside the courthouse  including one unforgettable set piece involving a prison riot and execution chamber escape. Sebastian Rudd is a kind of social justice warrior  and Grisham uses him to take jabs at the legal system. “The presumption of innocence is now the presumption of guilt ” he says. He points out the mass incarceration of black men. He dresses down trigger-happy cops who come armed with tanks and assault rifles. He damns the judges and district attorneys who want to secure their legacy  even if that means putting away the wrong person. And this is all expressed with a blunt  rude  gravelly poetic wiseguy voice that makes Rudd come across as a kind of 21st-century Philip Marlowe (he even wears a fedora). The book is divided into six novella-like parts that grow gradually more braided. We move from a backwater case involving a brain-damaged teenager accused of murder to a story about a police unit that kicks down the wrong door to a section about a crime boss on death row. People often say  upon setting down a novel  “I can see this making a great movie ” but “Rogue Lawyer” bears more resemblance to some of the best serial narratives on television. In a few years  if it shows up on FX or HBO  I’ll be the first to tune in  just as I’ll be the first to pick up any future novels starring Rudd. None Michael Hendricks is a ghost. He survived an ambush when fighting overseas  but nobody knows it — not the military  not his former fiancée — no one except his bomb-blasted buddy who works as his tech adviser. But now he’s being hunted. First by a fed named Charlotte Thompson  who believes Hendricks is responsible for 35 hits over the past two years alone. And also by the Council  a secret organization of several major American crime families. They want him dead for interfering with their business  so they put a million-dollar bounty on his head and hire a silk-smooth European assassin named Engelmann  who experiences a kind of orgasmic release with every bullet fired  every blade thrusted. “You are telling me you’ve a hit man killing hit men  and now you’re hiring a hit man to hit him back?” Engelmann says  and the representative from the Council says  “I’m telling you I’ve got a problem  and you’ve got one million reasons to fix it.” The cat-and-mouse game that follows is pure joy. And a set piece in which the rival forces converge at a Kansas City casino has the operatic magnificence of the famous stairway shootout in “The Untouchables.” The deadly blur of movement that comes when a soldier field strips  cleans and reassembles a rifle reminds me of the way Holm puts together a plot. This novel is so fast-moving  so expertly arranged  every piece fitting together with a well-oiled snap  that it feels weaponized. Read it. Or else. Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/books/chapters/0218-1st-ande.html,"‘The Triumph of the Thriller’ Advertisement Supported by First Chapter None  In 2000  Marie Arana  the editor of The Washington Post Book World  put me on the thriller beat. I had for years reviewed both fiction and nonfiction for Book World  but now Marie wanted me to focus on the crime-related novels that have come to dominate the best-seller lists. Soon I began reviewing a new book each Monday in the Post's freewheeling Style section.   Over the years  reading purely for pleasure  I'd become a fan of such writers as John D. MacDonald  Lawrence Sanders  Elmore Leonard  Ross Thomas  Ed McBain  James Lee Burke  Thomas Harris  and Michael Connelly. Now  reading thrillers on a regular basis  I learned how much more talent was out there. I discovered people like Dennis Lehane  Ian Rankin  Donna Leon  Robert Littell  George Pelecanos  John Lescroart  and Alan Furst. I reviewed best sellers by John Grisham  Tom Clancy  Sue Grafton  John Sandford  James Patterson  and Patricia Cornwell  some I admired  some I deplored  but their success says something about our popular culture. I've had the pleasure of telling our readers about new talent like Karin Slaughter  David Corbett  Robert Reuland  and Charlie Huston.   The more I read  the more I was struck by the transformation in America's reading habits. I grew up with the blockbuster novels of the 1950s and 1960s  written by people like James Michener  Harold Robbins  John O'Hara  Jacqueline Susann  Herman Wouk  and Irving Stone. They explored sex  money  movie stars  war  religion  and exotic foreign lands but rarely concerned themselves with crime. In those days  crime novels were trapped in the genre ghetto  often published as paperback originals  and rarely won a mass audience.   Today  those blockbuster novelists have been replaced on the best-seller lists by the crime-related fiction we loosely call thrillers  which includes hard-core noir  in the Hammett-Chandler private-eye tradition  as well as a bigger  broader universe of books that includes spy thrillers  legal thrillers  political thrillers  military thrillers  medical thrillers  and even literary thrillers. I have a copy of the December 25  1966  Book World-incredibly enough  I had a review in it. Starting at the top  the ten authors on the fiction best-seller list are Robert Crichton  Allen Drury  Jacqueline Susann  Rebecca West  Mary Renault  Edwin   O'Connor  James Clavell  Bernard Malamud  Harold Robbins  and Harry Mark Petrakis. Two political novelists  two or three literary writers  two grand masters of sex and schlock-but no crime fiction.   Compare that with a Book World list in February of 2006. By my count  nine of the ten books listed were thrillers  including Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code  Sue Grafton's S Is for Silence  and John Lescroart's The Hunt Club. Another Sunday that month  The New York Times Book Review had fifteen thrillers among its sixteen hardback best sellers  including those on the Post's list plus Greg Iles's Turning Angel  and various lesser works. The transformation between the lists in 1966 and 2006 could not be more dramatic. To oversimplify a bit  John Grisham is the new James Michener and The Da Vinci Code is our Gone with the Wind.   In this book  I'll look back to the origins of modern crime fiction- to writers like Edgar Allan Poe  Arthur Conan Doyle  and Agatha Christie-to examine how the modern thriller has evolved. The triumph of the thriller  I call this transformation. We will grapple with questions of definition. Just what is a thriller? How is it different from a mystery or a crime novel? The terminology is far from precise  but let me suggest a few guidelines.   Agatha Christie and her imitators wrote mysteries that stressed intellectual solutions to crimes. Her tradition continues in so- called cozies  which appeal to readers who want no violence  and in more ingenious novels by writers like the American Martha Grimes.   In this country  around 1930  Dashiell Hammett invented the American crime novel  also known as the detective or private-eye novel  and Raymond Chandler built on Hammett's work. Their hard-boiled tradition prevailed for several decades  but by the 1970s the crime novel began to mutate into something that was bigger  darker  more imaginative  and more violent: the modern thriller. Certain novels have been milestones in expanding the boundaries of the thriller-among them Lawrence Sanders's The First Deadly Sin  Frederick Forsyth's The Day of the Jackal  Scott Turow's Presumed Innocent  Tom Clancy's The Hunt for Red October  John Grisham's The Firm  Thomas Harris's The Silence of the Lambs  and Dennis Lehane's Mystic River.   John Updike said this while reviewing Robert Littell's surreal spy novel Legends in The New Yorker in 2005: ""The slippery difference between a thriller and a non-thriller would hardly be worth groping for did not the thriller-writers themselves seem to be restive- chafing to escape  yearning for a less restrictive contract with the reader. They write longer than they used to  with more flourishes."" Updike notes that Agatha Christie's ambitions never extended past the lean  efficient mysteries she wrote  but ""Littell and le CarrÈ and the estimable P. D. James give signs of wanting to be 'real' novelists  free to follow character where it takes them and to display their knowledge of the world without the obligation to provide a thrill in every chapter.""   The estimable Updike might have gone further and added a number of other thriller writers to his list of restive souls  many of whom have gone beyond wanting to be real writers to doing it. Novels like Bangkok 8  Hard Revolution  Tropic of Night  Done for a Dime  Red Dragon  Lost Light  and The Way the Crow Flies are simply some of the best fiction being written today.   I had misgivings when Marie put me on the thriller beat. I was an English major in the uptight 1950s  when the high modernists-T. S. Eliot  James Joyce  William Faulkner-were force-fed to undergraduates  and for years I felt a tremor of guilt when I stooped to popular fiction and certainly to thrillers. A lot of people of my generation felt that way. When my political thriller The President's Mistress was published in 1976  The Washington Post's reviewer declared that she locked herself in her office until she finished it. It was  she said  ""a Mt. Everest among cliff-hangers."" I was feeling pretty good until she sandbagged me at the end: ""Of course  I always did like Chinese food.""   In other words  I'd given her a few hours of guilty pleasure  but I wasn't a serious writer providing solid sustenance. I was guilty as charged  of course  but consoled by a $250 000 paperback sale and a movie deal. A few years later I saw another review in which that same writer confessed that  after much soul-searching  she had decided it was all right to enjoy popular fiction. I was happy for her.   A lot of people have a hard time making the leap from officially approved ""literary"" fiction to novels that are fun  and they aren't all refugees from the fifties. I received an e-mail recently from a college student in Houston  an English major  asking what thrillers he should read-or whether he should read them at all. ""I am racked with guilt if I read any of this stuff. Life is short. I haven't finished all of Dickens or Shakespeare. Do I have time for detective novels?"" I could only advise him that life is a lot longer than he at present understands and there is time for  say  Elmore Leonard and Dennis Lehane along with Dickens and Shakespeare.   The more I read  the more I saw that Marie  in putting me on the thriller beat  had given me the new mainstream of American popular fiction to splash about in. I want to examine this new mainstream and how it came about. I want to show who the good writers are and why- and  to a lesser degree  who some bad ones are and why. It seems to me beyond dispute that the level of talent at work today in thrillers and crime fiction is superior to anything that has previously existed in America or Great Britain. I say this having recently reread a number of acclaimed crime novels that I first read several decades ago. Alas  the books we loved in our youth  like the sweet young things we dallied with  have not always aged well. Our memories play tricks on us and often we have been misled by movies that vastly improved the original material. Nostalgia is the sweetest of drugs  but it will cloud our minds  distort our memories  and lead us into error if we let it.   We must ask why thrillers have become increasingly popular. Of course  stories of danger and suspense have always had visceral appeal. Lee Child  author of the Jack Reacher series  once summed this up nicely:   In human evolution we developed language  we developed storytelling  and that must have been for a serious purpose. I think right from the caveman days  we had stories that involved danger and peril  and eventually safety and resolution. To me that is the story. And that's what we're still telling today  100 000 years later. That's what a page-turner is.   But there are contemporary reasons for the triumph of the thriller as well. One is the transformation of the book business. Once hailed as a ""gentleman's profession "" publishing today is more like a barroom brawl as corporate takeovers have intensified bottom-line pressures on editors. And the bottom line is that thrillers sell  which means there is a continuing scramble to find the writers who can produce books that translate into corporate profits. There are other social and cultural factors  of course. Decades of war  recession  and political and corporate corruption have made Americans more cynical- or realistic-and thus more open to novels that examine the dark side of our society. And yet most thrillers manage some sort of happy ending. They have it both ways  reminding us how ugly and dangerous our society can be and yet offering hope in the end. Thrillers provide the illusion of order and justice in a world that often seems to have none.   Of course  we read for fun too. We love the excitement of suspense. We want to know whodunit. Indeed  these days  we love suspense more than sex  at least in books. In the fifties and sixties  sex was a huge element in popular fiction  from I  the Jury to Peyton Place to Portnoy's Complaint and countless others. Today  we're up to our ears in sex. Who wants to read about it? The books I'm discussing contain relatively little sex and dirty talk  nothing like what we endure on HBO. In the modern thriller  suspense has replaced sex as the engine that drives popular fiction.   As thrillers have become more popular and their potential rewards greater  more of the most talented young writers  those who a generation ago would have produced anguished novels about their unhappy childhoods  are instead trying to become the next Grisham or Grafton. The level of their work has risen until the best of today's thrillers are the white-hot center of American fiction. We hear talk about this or that ""golden age"" of yesteryear. Forget it. Right here  right now  is the golden age of thrillers  some of which transcend genre. The Silence of the Lambs and Mystic River are excellent examples. Both novels-and the Oscar-winning movies made from them-are vastly more sophisticated and powerful than their counterparts from earlier eras.   This book is not about me-often a vital point for a writer to grasp- but it is indisputably by me  so I think it reasonable to say a little about my background  preferences  and prejudices. The central fact is that  as reader and reviewer  I fall into three related categories: bookworm  middlebrow  and writer.   The turning point in my life came when I was four and spent a year living with my maternal grandparents. My grandmother was a fussy little woman who decided it was high time I learned to read. I remember sitting on the floor as she stood at a blackboard and taught me my ABCs. Soon I was reading the Sunday comics and then books. I still have the copy of Huckleberry Finn she gave me the Christmas I was six. I was never much of a student-I was bored in the early grades and rebellious in high school-but I read a lot and could always write an essay or book report  in a pinch I would make up the book. Most of what I learned in my early years resulted from taking the bus to the Fort Worth Public Library each Saturday morning  checking out the maximum five books  reading them  and going back the next Saturday for five more. The Hardy Boys were my first crime series  if you don't count the Dick Tracy comic strip.   My mother kept best sellers around the house. The first grown-up novel I remember reading  at twelve or so  was The Robe  which featured one hell of an exciting sword fight. I loved George Orwell's Animal Farm without having a clue about its political message. I devoured the short stories of Mark Twain  who did a great deal to corrupt my young mind. When I was a teenager  you could feel awfully isolated in Texas if you weren't part of its dominant culture  which worshipped football  oil  Cadillacs  and country clubs. You were always listening for faint signals from afar  evidence that others out there shared your discontent. By high school I was deep into Somerset Maugham  whose views were decidedly un-Texan  and Sinclair Lewis  who encouraged me to scorn the George Babbitts and Elmer Gantrys I saw around me.   I spent two years at North Texas State  in nearby Denton  where my fellow students included Pat Boone  who joined my fraternity before he dashed off to stardom  and Bill Moyers  whom I would meet again a decade later in the White House. Larry McMurtry arrived on campus just after I left  we both took a writing course from Dr. James Brown. Life was good at North Texas-except that  like many an impressionable lad of that era  I had come under the spell of F. Scott Fitzgerald. I dreamed of Princeton's ivory towers. Alas  I lacked the money-not to mention the grades-to enter that distant paradise. But I had a friend at the University of the South  in Sewanee  Tennessee  and I managed to scrape together the wherewithal to enroll there.   Until then I had read at random. At Sewanee  people were actually teaching me. I took a good course on Shakespeare and a great one on the Renaissance poets  taught by an incomparable Alabaman  Dr. Charles Trawick Harrison. It was the most important course in my college career. Once you begin to appreciate the majesty of Andrew Marvell's ""But at my back I always hear / Time's wingËd chariot hurrying near"" and the music of Robert Herrick's ""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may  / Old Time is still a-flying "" you start to grasp the potential of our language. I also took a course on Romantic poets that bored me and one on literary criticism that baffled me. I was starting to realize that there were highbrows in the world and there were middlebrows  and I was among the latter. . . .  None None None Advertisement ",articles/movies

The police called his death a suicide. None Sushant Singh Rajput  a prominent actor in Indian films and television programs  was found dead on Sunday in his home in Mumbai. He was 34. His family announced the death in a statement but did not give a cause. The police in Mumbai said that the death was a suicide and that an investigation was underway. “It pains us to share that Sushant Singh Rajput is no longer with us ” the family statement read. “We request his fans to keep him in their thoughts and celebrate his life and his work like they have done so far.” Mr. Rajput started his acting career on television  where he was best known for his role as a car mechanic  Manav Deshmukh  in “Pavitra Rishta ” a soap opera that debuted in 2009. None None “His rise in the world of entertainment inspired many  and he leaves behind several memorable performances ” Mr. Modi wrote. None None Sushant Singh Rajput was born on Jan. 21  1986  in Patna  in the Indian state of Bihar. His father  Krishna Kumar Singh  was an engineer  and his mother  Usha Singh  was a homemaker. Sushant was the youngest of their five children and the only boy. None He took acting and dancing classes in college  eventually dropping out to become a dancer for the choreographer Shiamak Davar.

https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/26/movies/film-in-review-bollywood-hollywood.html,FILM IN REVIEW  'Bollywood/Hollywood' Advertisement Supported by FILM IN REVIEW None Directed by Deepa Mehta PG-13  103 minutes The Canadian filmmaker Deepa Mehta has made a pair of striking films  ''Fire'' (1996) and ''Earth'' (1998)  about pressing social issues (sex and religion  specifically) in her native India. Now  back in Toronto  she has made ''Bollywood/Hollywood '' a disappointingly shallow and not terribly funny romantic comedy opening today in New York that seems to be making yet another bid for the public that packed its way into ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding.'' Ms. Mehta's protagonist is Rahul Seth (Rahul Khanna  who played a small role in ''Earth'')  a son of wealthy East Indian parents who has made a fortune for himself in computer technology. He has been unable to find a suitable Indian bride to take home to his mother (Moushumi Chatterjee) and grandmother (Dina Pathak  a beloved Bollywood star who died last year and who specialized in nagging mothers-in-law). With his sister's marriage coming up  he has to find a date who can pass the grueling examination process  so he hires Sue (Lisa Ray)  a beautiful but ethnically vague young woman (she lets Rahul believe she is Spanish) he has met in a bar. Believing her to be a prostitute  he pays her to take a crash course in Indian authenticity and pretend to be his fiancée at the upcoming nuptials. Dressed up in a sari  Sue turns out to be a hit with all of the female relatives  but she has a few surprises up her sleeve: she is neither Spanish nor a prostitute nor entirely uninterested in Rahul as a life partner. The script  by Ms. Mehta  wants to be self-conscious in its frequent use of cliché and coincidence  inviting comparison to both the contrived romantic comedies of Hollywood and Bollywood's grandly artificial musicals (hence the title). But the dialogue and situations have little in the way of genuine wit  and the pseudo-Bollywood production numbers that punctuate the action (often with explanatory subtitles  like ''Romantic Couple Song'') are never as extravagant or entertaining as the real thing. ''Bollywood/Hollywood'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some strong language and mildly suggestive situations. DAVE KEHR Advertisement ,articles/movies

The standoff began in early April when Mumbai producers said they would stop making new movies if they did not receive a larger share of the profits earned from films shown at India’s multiplex theaters  which account for 60 to 65 percent of the nation’s ticket revenue. The theater owners said they would seek films they could distribute on their own. Talks between the two sides broke down on Tuesday. Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/opinion/bollywood-padmavati-ranveer-singh.html,Fear and Prejudice in Bollywood Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None MUMBAI  India — On Dec. 1  Sanjay Leela Bhansali  one of the most opulent and operatic filmmakers in Bollywood  was releasing his movie “Padmavati ” which is based on a mythical Hindu queen. Two weeks before the theatrical release  some Hindu activists from the Rajput warrior caste declared that the movie hurt the sentiments of their community by depicting a Muslim king lusting after a Rajput queen. And they could not permit that to be shown under any circumstance. None None None None Alauddin Khilji did fight and defeat the Rajput king of Chittor in Rajasthan in the early 14th century. Queen Padmavati  however  never existed. The legend of Padmavati was born more than two centuries after Khilji’s death. Malik Muhammad Jayasi  a Sufi Muslim poet  created the character of Padmavati in an epic poem he wrote in the mid-16th century. None None The trailer of the movie suggests that Mr. Bhansali has portrayed Khilji as a savage despite historians’ rather complimentary assessments. Mr. Bhansali’s Khilji has shoulder-length hair  eyes lined with black kohl  and several scars adding menace to his face. He rides furiously ahead of a mighty invading army  pounds men to dust in wrestling matches  bares his teeth after psychopathic laughter and lustily chomps on a massive chunk of meat. None None None The protests around the movie helped create the myth of Hindu sentiments being under siege. Even a fictional queen and a Muslim king have become tools to garner Hindu votes. Fabricating a hostile “other” helps retain power. The methodology has been transparent — generate fear and hatred  and use those to legitimate violence. None Because Bollywood movies are widely publicized and occupy a significant place in everyday conversation  they become perfect targets to generate instant publicity for the groups or individuals attacking them. Bollywood has developed a justifiable sense of being left to the wolves  the state has almost never shown any inclination to prevent or curb violence against films. The film industry itself has failed to offer a unified  collective response. The biggest stars and the most influential filmmakers have stayed silent. There have been no calls for strikes and protests  no appeals for boycotts or shutdowns. They see such attacks as specific to the film  its actors and filmmaker. It doesn’t concern itself about the broader principles of creative freedom. The fear of a mob at their glamorous gates is a factor in their silence but Bollywood stars and producers also have a long history of acquiescence and cowardice in their dealings with power. The assault on Mr. Bhansali’s movie illustrates a bleak scenario where Bollywood’s anxiety about extraconstitutional censorship will weigh heavily on its creative choices. It might just fall back on the old formula of romances and comedies with song and dance routines. Advertisement ,articles/movies

https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/28/opinion/hurray-for-bollywood.html,Hurray for Bollywood Advertisement Supported by None Last week this city's film industry  called Bollywood  held its own version of the Oscars. There were well-rehearsed jokes and solemn speeches  and somewhat more spontaneous hugs and tears. Soon after it ended  most of the prize winners left for Dubai to attend yet another awards ceremony  their fourth in less than a month. Bollywood tends to congratulate itself even more frequently and fulsomely than Hollywood. And  perhaps  it has good reasons for doing so: India makes around 800 films each year  more than any country in the world. Bollywood produces up to 200 films in Hindi and Urdu alone. Little of what comes out of this $1.3 billion-a-year industry is of much quality  and few films make a profit. Yet India  where approximately 12 million people go to the movies every day  remains culturally a world unto itself  immune to the films emerging from Hollywood  which have captured only 6 percent of the largest domestic movie market in the world. Moreover  Bollywood's films reach up to 3.6 billion people around the world -- a billion more than the audience for Hollywood. Egyptians  South Africans and Fijians joined Indians in electing Amitabh Bachchan -- a name unknown to most people in Europe and America -- as the ''actor of the millennium'' in a BBC online poll. Mr. Bachchan gained his reputation by repeatedly playing the role of the poor  resentful young man who makes it in the big city -- often through crime and violence. But Bollywood films do more than sell garish dreams of a better life to the poor. To people struggling for emotional and material security within their increasingly modern and fragmented societies  they offer the consolations of tradition  especially of family values. Mr. Bachchan's angry young man usually dies in the arms of his mother or father  having realized the folly of his ways. In this sense  an absurdly melodramatic extravaganza from Bollywood may speak more directly to a third-world audience than even the most politically sensitive Hollywood film. Bollywood films are popular even in countries like Egypt and Indonesia that have strong cultures that resist the American barrage. It is not uncommon for Iraqis and Afghans to greet the Indian aid workers and technical consultants helping rebuild their nations with snatches of half-remembered Hindi songs and names of Bollywood stars from the 1970's. And now  after decades of recycling the same melodramatic plots and extravagant dance numbers  Bollywood is having a youth movement. A new generation of filmmakers is appealing not just to the traditional lower-middle class and poor audience. It is also reaching members of the educated urban elite who had looked down on Bollywood films  and also to the millions of Indians living in Britain and America. The highest-profile effort is ''Kal Ho Na Ho'' (''Tomorrow May Never Come'') by Karan Johar. The movie is set entirely in New York  yet it doesn't stray far from Bollywood's usual version of the romantic triangle. It does bring a new slickness to Bollywood dreams of affluence and style -- while singing  the characters combine Hindi lyrics with the rhythms of disco  rap and gospel -- but it simultaneously reaffirms family through a gregarious cast of brothers  sisters  parents  grandmothers and grandfathers. Mr. Johar's films  along with more realistic and sober movies by young directors like Ram Gopal Varma  are becoming the echo chamber of middle-class India as it tries to bend -- without breaking -- its old  austere culture of underdevelopment. Some Bollywood directors see a great opportunity to score over Hollywood. Certainly  the global village seems to need a more complex moral code than that offered by Rambo and the Terminator  and Bollywood  even with all its apparently absurd sentimentality  may be better placed to provide it than the cynically  if slickly  retailed violence of Hollywood.

Viraj (Mr. Kumar) is a stuntman  Sim (Ms. Kapoor) a model/surgeon. When they meet  it’s aversion at first sight.  Slick and fast and set to a thumping techno soundtrack by Anu Malik  “Kambakkht Ishq” (“Damn Love”) is Bollywood  21st-century style: kissing  women (American women  that is) stripping down to their skivvies  swearing (in English  at least)  and South Asians everywhere (but India nowhere in sight). The film  written and directed by Sabbir Khan  has only one frantic desire: to entertain. It spottily succeeds  despite its frequently crude humor  relentless pace and a few unpalatable racial bits. Viraj sports black face in one scene  and in another  during an airport search  he is violated by a large African-American woman.  Also along for the ride are some Americans  playing themselves. Sylvester Stallone (“the man  the legend”) gives Viraj a stuntman of the year award and later materializes out of thin air to save Sim from a cartoonish pack of miscreants. And Denise Richards plays one of Mr. Kumar’s many girlfriends. (“I want to have golden babies with you.”) Viraj and Sim’s “I hate you  I hate you  I love you” plot breaks no new ground in the gender wars. But “Kambakkht Ishq” is aspirational in another sense. To end the opening montage of Hollywood sights and glossy American stars  Mr. Kumar comes flying through a window on a motorcycle.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/movies/joel-schumacher-batman.html,Don’t Forget That Joel Schumacher Briefly Saved Batman Advertisement Supported by Schumacher’s flash and style may well have rescued the franchise. (And then  two years later  nearly sank it.) None None That’s putting it mildly. The overt campiness and winking theatricality of Schumacher’s “Batman Forever” and “Batman & Robin” have long been a point of polarization among fans of comic book movies  particularly as a darker aesthetic  first established by Tim Burton and then cemented on movie screens by Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder  has come to define the character. But Schumacher’s approach may well have saved the franchise. (And then  two years later  nearly sank it.) Schumacher seemed  to some  like an unlikely candidate to take the Bat-baton (Baton?) from Burton. But throughout his career  there was rarely a specific idea of a “Joel Schumacher film”  he was closer to the filmmakers of the classic studio system  a journeyman who could take on just about any assignment he was tossed  deliver it on time and on budget  and generate a profit. So he dabbled in rowdy comedy (“D.C. Cab”)  touchy-feely dramedy (“St. Elmo’s Fire”)  romantic comedy (“Cousins”)  horror (“The Lost Boys”) and sci-fi (“Flatliners”). Warner Bros. handed him Batman based on the success of his adaptation of John Grisham’s legal thriller “The Client.” None None Schumacher’s critics (and there were many) often gleefully noted that his training was not in filmmaking but fashion  entering the film industry as a costume designer. But that eye for flash and style was clearly what Warner Bros. felt the franchise needed at the time  after the bleak and borderline monochromatic look of Burton’s Batmen — which were less comic-book movies than graphic-novel movies  taking visible pains to separate themselves from the campy and colorful 1960s television series that still loomed large in the popular imagination. “Batman Forever ” on the other hand  opened its arms to that influence. The screenplay — credited to Lee Batchler  Janet Scott Batchler  and Akiva Goldsman — is gleefully goofy  filled with corny one-liners and leering double entendres. Schumacher and his cinematographer  Stephen Goldblatt (nominated for an Oscar  one of the film’s three nominations)  cram their Dutch-angled frames with candy-coated colors  neon lights and billowing dry ice  while Elliot Goldenthal’s musical score takes the orchestral pomposity of Danny Elfman’s earlier “Batman” themes and cranks it up to 11. The performers similarly go for the gusto: Jim Carrey is at his most unhinged (no small achievement)  Tommy Lee Jones chews scenery like it’s his first meal in weeks  and Nicole Kidman vamps it up like the daughter Dietrich didn’t know she had. None That failure caused a bit of retroactive conflation of the two Schumacher pictures  which is unfortunate. “Batman Forever” may not have proven a bellwether of big-screen superhero entertainment  though a dose of self-aware silliness wouldn’t hurt the Very Serious Filmmakers at both Marvel and DC one bit. But it may be the most succinct encapsulation of the Schumacher style: a big and gaudy  colorful and stylish  cheerfully unapologetic crowd-pleaser. Advertisement ,articles/movies

His father  Joseph  owned a grocery store  his mother  Ruth (Noonan) O’Neil  was a homemaker. As a child Denny was a fan of comic books  movies and radio shows like “The Adventures of Superman” and “Jack Armstrong  the All-American Boy.” But comic books had faded in his life by the time he graduated  in 1961  from Saint Louis University  where he studied English literature  creative writing and philosophy.

None None The cause was cancer  with which he had been struggling for about a year  Bebe Lerner  a spokeswoman for his family  said in a statement. After satiating a youthful appetite for illicit drugs  Mr. Schumacher found more constructive outlets as a window designer for New York department stores like Henri Bendel. And after arriving in Los Angeles in the early 1970s  he worked as a costume designer on films like the crime drama “The Last of Sheila” and Woody Allen’s “Sleeper” (both from 1973)  then graduated to directorial assignments for television and motion pictures. None He made bold sartorial choices in his films as well. Some  like the punk-rock outfits of his young vampires in “The Lost Boys” (1987)  advanced fashion trends  others  like the articulated nipples on the Batsuit in “Batman and Robin” (1997)  did not. Mr. Schumacher worked steadily for decades  directing thrillers like “A Time to Kill” (1996)  “Phone Booth” (2002) and “Trespass” (2011). Yet he saw himself as dispensable in the eyes of the industry he served  where a single perceived misstep can end a career. None Joel Schumacher was born on Aug. 29  1939  to Francis and Marian Schumacher. His father  a Baptist from Knoxville  Tenn.  died when Joel was 4  and he was raised in Long Island City  Queens  by his mother  who was Jewish and had come from Sweden. (As Joel Schumacher said of himself  “I’m an American mongrel.”) Mr. Schumacher said he began drinking at the age of 9 and spent his formative years abusing L.S.D.  methedrine and other drugs. But he found steady work as a window dresser (Macy’s  Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue also hired him) and studied for a time at the Fashion Institute of Technology. He later graduated with honors from the Parsons School of Design. When his mother died in 1965  Mr. Schumacher felt he had hit bottom. “My life seemed like a joke ” he told The Times. “I was living in this criminal environment. I was $50 000 in debt. I had lost six teeth. I weighed 130 pounds.” Yet by 1970 he had stopped taking drugs and was employed at Bendel  the luxury goods emporium then on West 57th Street  where  he said  he rebuilt his life. “I got my self-respect back getting a good day’s pay for a good day’s work ” he said. In Hollywood  his costume-design work  beginning with the 1972 drama “Play It as It Lays” (directed by Frank Perry  and written by Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne)  gave him a foothold in filmmaking and screenwriting. He went on to write the screenplays for the musical drama “Sparkle” and the comedy “Car Wash ” both released in 1976  and for Sidney Lumet’s 1978 adaptation of the musical “The Wiz.” Mr. Schumacher earned his first directorial credits with TV movies: “Virginia Hill” (1974)  starring Dyan Cannon as the title character and Harvey Keitel as her gangster boyfriend  Bugsy Siegel  and “Amateur Night at the Dixie Bar and Grill” (1979)  an ensemble comedy-drama set at a country-western roadhouse. None None So  too  was “The Lost Boys ” which pit Jason Patric and Corey Haim against a gang of young bloodsuckers led by Kiefer Sutherland. Still other hits included the supernatural thriller “Flatliners” (1990)  which starred Mr. Sutherland and Julia Roberts  and his 1991 romantic drama “Dying Young ” which starred Roberts and Campbell Scott. After directing “Falling Down” (1993) with Michael Douglas and “The Client” (1994)  adapted from the John Grisham novel  Mr. Schumacher was chosen to take over Warner Brothers’ then-nascent Batman franchise from the director Tim Burton  who was perceived to have taken the superhero movies in an increasingly gothic (and hence  uncommercial) direction. None None At his death Mr. Schumacher lived in Greenwich Village. Information on his survivors was not immediately available. None “My other films were much smaller and had just found success with the audience and not often with the critics  which is really why we wrote them ” he said. “And then after ‘Batman and Robin ’ I was scum. It was like I had murdered a baby.” Even so  Mr. Schumacher was not ostracized from filmmaking  his output remained constant  as did his passion for the movies he made. “I spent so much time as a kid in the movies in Long Island City ” he told The Times in 1993. “There’s something about being that kid in a dark theater and growing up and cutting these films in dark editing rooms and putting them out in dark theaters where people can connect to them. I somehow feel connected with humanity when I create humanity on that screen.” Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/podcasts/the-daily/val-kilmer.html,The Sunday Read: ‘The Iceman in Winter’ Advertisement transcript Hi  It’s Taffy Brodesser-Akner  and I’m a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine. I have been trying to write a story about Val Kilmer for about five years. He was the quintessential blockbuster matinee movie idol of my youth. He was in — You guys really are cowboys. What’s your problem  Kazansky? — “Top Gun.” I don’t like you because you’re dangerous. That’s right! Ice ... man. Let’s just say I was testing the bounds of reality. He starred as Jim Morrison in “The Doors.” He was Batman! The bat-signal is not a beeper. Well  I wish I could say that my interest in you was ... purely professional. And then one day he stopped showing up in movies. All of a sudden  I realized it had been a really long time since I’d seen Val Kilmer on a big screen. So I thought I was telling a story about where Val Kilmer was. But by the time he finally agreed to speak with me earlier this year  I found a completely different story there. It turns out that Val Kilmer is a man of extraordinary faith. And the reason that that matters is because in the years since I had started asking to speak with him  a lot of things had changed and so had I. I had been raised in a house of tremendous religious observance beyond just kind of traditional Judaism  there was a lot of Kabbalistic mysticism. And along with that  a belief that was instilled in me that no matter what  everything was going to be OK. And in the last five years  I have really lost track of that. I no longer believe it. And so the story about Val Kilmer went from being a story about where he went and turned into a story about someone who still believes that. I don’t know if it could change anybody from being terrified about the state of the world  but I know that it will not hurt anybody to spend a few minutes remembering that there are other ways to look at things. So here’s my story  “The Iceman in Winter ” read for you by Julia Whelan. It’s hard to believe now  as I write this  but just two months ago  when we were allowed to roam free  when we could board planes and alight from them and wander into rental cars and check into hotels — when we could chase down and replenish the beauty and wonder our very cells need to survive — I went to Los Angeles  where I was asked this question by Val Kilmer: “Do you think South by Southwest will be canceled?” But Val Kilmer no longer sounds like Val Kilmer  the movie star of the ‘80s and ‘90s who has mostly vanished from screens. He hasn’t since his tracheostomy. He can still squeeze air up through his windpipe  however  and past the hole that was cut into his throat and the tracheostomy tube  in a way that makes him somewhat understood — not very  but somewhat. The sound is something between a squeak and a voiceless roar. He says the fact that I can understand him is a result of the endless vocal exercises that he was trained to do when he went to Juilliard after high school  that he was taught to work his voice “like it was a trumpet.” He hated the authoritarian rule at Juilliard while he was there  he hated those stupid vocal exercises. Now look at him  still using his most beloved instrument when really  by all rights  it should be useless. See how it all turned out for the best? All Val Kilmer’s stories are like that  told with that same dash of preordained kismet. He was traveling in Africa in 1994 when he decided to spend a morning exploring a bat cave  later that day  literally seriously that day  he was inspired to call his agent  who had been trying to contact Kilmer for weeks to see if he was interested in playing the role of Batman  now that Michael Keaton was hanging it up. Another story: In the days before he set eyes for the first time on his (now ex-) wife  Joanne Whalley  he dreamed that he met the woman he was destined for and woke up and immediately wrote a poem called  “We’ve Just Met but Marry Me Please.” Then right after that  he went to London  and while he was there  he saw a play  and Whalley was in it. He was so taken with her that he followed her to the pub after-party just so he could look at her. This was crazy even for him  so he made no move. But two years later  in 1987  she would be randomly coincidentally serendipitously cast opposite him in “Willow ” and they would end up married. So yes  he can talk  and it’s such a miracle that he has these abilities  because if you have enough faith  you’ll see how every part of your life is just a piece of a bigger part of your life  and nothing is an accident  and everything is good. We were in his office at HelMel  an office space/art gallery/artists’ studio/retail museum for Val Kilmer’s movie career that takes up several storefronts and more than half the block of Melrose Avenue between Edgemont Street and Heliotrope Drive in Hollywood. Officially  according to Brad Koepenick  his childhood friend and adult business associate  who was in the room to help me better understand Kilmer  HelMel’s mission is to serve as “a fun  sacred space where eclectic artists gather with novices to collaborate  and through new technology  inspire change and spark giving in our local underserved community.” One is a traditional art gallery. Another is a dark window display with three black cubes that say GOD stenciled in white paint  behind which is an inventory of merch from Kilmer’s long and storied movie career — socks that featured his “Tombstone” character  Doc Holliday  and Jim Morrison coasters from his role in “The Doors” and some paintings that Kilmer himself created  some of which are about his film career (a rendering of his “Top Gun” character  Iceman  with the word “LOVE” stenciled across it) and some that aren’t (a hummingbird in a forest). The final storefront is a door that leads to the Willy Wonka core of HelMel. Inside there’s a podcasting studio  a cafe area and a screening room. HelMel also houses a foundation Val and Koepenick created called TwainMania  which aims to send its Mark Twain curriculum into schools. Twice a week  high school students from South Central Los Angeles practice “Hamlet” and other plays there as part of a program called Inner City Shakespeare. HelMel started holding events last February: a screening of “Tombstone ” an Echo in the Canyon concert. It is the creative incubator of Kilmer’s dreams — the fruition of a vision he had always hoped his 6 000-acre New Mexico ranch would be before he lost most of it in the 2008 housing crash. “The idea is to create kind of a life that’s active ” Kilmer told me. “It’s active. It’s alive. I want the feel of it being alive. You feel the electricity.” He sat at his desk. Behind him was a replica of a painting he had sold to Robert Downey Jr. and  on the other side  a maybe two-foot-tall Batman figure with a Mark Twain head. Elsewhere were Apple computers from the 1980s and 1990s dipped in glossy red paint  a tumbleweed bathed in gold paint. There was a box of newly shipped hardcovers of his new memoir  “I’m Your Huckleberry ” which debuted on the best-seller list in April  a brooding photo of the Val Kilmer of your 1990s matinee memories on its cover. On the walls were more of his paintings  swishes of paint and resin and oil (and sometimes spray paint) on sheets of repurposed aluminum. He makes them by swirling around the chemicals and paint until they look like an emotion or an element to him  at which point he adds a photograph  solidifying his theory into fact. I stood and admired a rectangle of blue-gray haze that he had determined looked like ocean waves  and so he had added photos of swimmers  diving into the waves  one after another. Of all the projects going on inside the studio at that minute  it was a short animated film about Mark Twain that concerned him most. In it  Mark Twain falls asleep and dreams of the resurrection of Jesus Christ  resulting in his waking up and realizing that Mary Baker Eddy  the founder of Christian Science — Val Kilmer is a lifelong Christian Scientist — was correct about God’s eminent perfection and the theories of Mrs. Eddy  as Kilmer calls her  about God’s capacity to heal. Kilmer loves a lot of things  but two of the tops are Mark Twain and Mrs. Eddy. Kilmer wanted to debut the short at South by Southwest in a few weeks. It was early March. There were rumors that festivals and concerts and even air travel might be canceled. Kilmer believed that even if he and his team couldn’t take an airplane  they could just drive to Austin and still screen “Mark Twain Dreams of the Resurrection” and  I don’t know  will the festival into existence. He was undaunted by all the signs and portents that made it feel as if the world were dropping to its knees  he believed if he could get the film done and over to Austin  the rest would take care of itself. So when he asked me if South by Southwest would be canceled  I told him I didn’t know. The surgeon general had started asking the public not to hoard surgical masks  and just that morning  Los Angeles had declared a state of emergency. “You don’t think we will be going to Cannes?” Kilmer asked. “How about the Olympics? The Olympics has never been canceled except in time of world war.” You can’t cancel the world  right? Bad things happen  but you still need art. Right? Right! You still need art. You still need forward momentum. You still need to believe that all your effort wasn’t for nothing  that we could — we will — survive a dark moment in history and that when that happens  we won’t be left without the things that made those moments decipherable and meaningful and therefore tolerable. The world outside had seemed to be getting so  so bad for so  so long  and this was the first whiff of overarching hope and positivity that I’d witnessed in I couldn’t remember how many months or years now — so much so that I almost couldn’t identify it when I saw it. The last glowing embers of hope coming from Val Kilmer? The movie hunk of my youth  who disappeared unceremoniously and now presented with an entirely different appearance and a bizarre accounting of where he’d been? But there was something familiar about it  like a faint knocking that came from inside me: It was the special kind of optimism that maybe only the faithful have  the enduring belief that some force will come along and save us from the centrifuge of despair we’ve found ourselves in. When is the last time you saw that up close? Before you can understand the story of what happened to Val Kilmer  you have to determine for yourself who he was in the first place. Trying to compare him to any movie star working either now or then will fry your mental circuit board: He was an upwardly mobile conventional movie star  he was equally a fringe weirdo who would soon disappear. His first movie  “Top Secret!” (1984)  about a rock star in East Berlin  was the follow-up to “Airplane!” by its creative team  and it was so funny  and such a strange thing to see this extraordinarily handsome young kid — a jaw like the sharp-cut bottom half of a stop sign  that true-Swede golden hair  a Cupid’s bow that lays in shadow of the plump convex swoop of his upper lip — who also seemed to be in on the joke. The ‘80s were a time when a handsome young man with blond hair was mostly the butt of it. He’d been on the road to something slightly more  say  classical when he was at Juilliard. He starred in “Orestes” and in “The Wood Demon.” He wrote a play with his classmates called “How It All Began ” which went on to run for a month at the Public Theater after Joe Papp himself saw it at the school. He starred in “Slab Boys” with Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon. He did “As You Like It” in Minneapolis with Patti LuPone. But once Hollywood got a look at him  he was on too-fast a conveyor belt to safely step off. The success of “Top Secret!” begat a somewhat-starring role in “Real Genius ” meaning that his Chris Knight  the apathetic  irresistible prodigy who helps something laser chemical transmitter radio something  is the guy on the poster  but he’s not the character with the clearest narrative arc  he’s more of a wise fool in the Shakespeare tradition. Another hit. Then in 1986 came “Top Gun ” and after that  everyone knew who Val Kilmer was. Because how could you not? Iceman  the fighter pilot Tom Cruise’s Maverick is trying to best for the “best of the best” of the best position  has maybe 17 words in the whole movie  but it is there that you can see Val Kilmer’s greatest gift  which is to make something out of nothing — to breathe real life into a character who was only there to set the volleyball so that Maverick could spike it. If you asked me then what beguiled me about Val Kilmer  I wouldn’t have had the words for it. Instead  I would have pictured a man without a shirt (I am still hard-pressed to picture young Val Kilmer in a regular shirt)  but it wasn’t his body that stuck with me when the lights came on. No  it was his awesome physicality  him spinning that volleyball on his finger  him offering the most fraught ‘80s masculinity-soaked condolences ever when Maverick’s radar intercept officer  Goose  buys it during a flight exercise — there was something in his immense focus and his full-bodied commitment to just plain Being-in-the-Scene that took my breath away. I read somewhere that Kilmer was so dedicated to inhabiting the role that he created Team Iceman and Team Maverick factions in the “Top Gun” movie cast. What I also remember is Iceman’s snapping his gum with his mighty jaw in nonresponse to Maverick’s admitting that yes  he’s dangerous. In that jaw snap — which is my absolute favorite GIF to send to people — there’s so much more than a weird way to end a conversation: It’s arrogance and pathos  frustration and whatever the emotion is where you know that laughing at someone will hurt them more than insulting them. The next few jobs came relatively quickly: the crazed  greedy  delightful Madmartigan in “Willow ” shouting epithets at the hero of the story with a vitality and electricity that makes you somehow root for him  “Kill Me Again ” in which he plays a dumb investigator who becomes the mark of a con woman (played by his wife at the time  Joanne Whalley)  “The Doors ” an Oliver Stone movie made extremely watchable by Kilmer’s Method performance as Jim Morrison  so Methody and deep in the role  it’s not so long into any kind of rewatching of that movie that I realize I can no longer remember what real Jim Morrison sounded or looked like. Then the beloved “Tombstone ” in which he once again went deep Method on the tubercular dentist  Doc Holliday  sweaty and yellow  gasping for breath through his puffs on his cigarette. It was around this time that both Kilmer and his viewing public ran into a problem. If you’re good at acting  and you’re superhunky  and you look good with your shirt off and also are willing to take it off  you are an excellent candidate for a promotion  and so Val Kilmer leveled up. Pretty soon  he was cast as pure leads of what were or were designed to be blockbusters: “Batman Forever ” “The Island of Dr. Moreau ” “The Saint.” He didn’t do badly in any of those roles  exactly. It’s more as if all the elements were there  but they couldn’t unite to make a real person — the whole was less than the sum of its parts. His Jack Andrews in “Kill Me Again” is supposed to be some kind of Everyman  but he’s really the absence of a person  a body without a soul. In “Thunderheart ” Kilmer plays a regular-guy F.B.I. agent with some Native American lineage  and I couldn’t really get through the rest. In “Batman Forever ” he barely moves his face  and well  here were the reviews: Janet Maslin in this newspaper said Kilmer was “hamstrung by the straight-man aspects of the role ” while Roger Ebert raved that he was “completely acceptable.” There came reports of problems on sets — that he was complaining constantly and making impossible demands  that he was rude to his co-stars and stayed in character all the time  never bothering with even small courtesies to the other people on set. That he fought with Oliver Stone about glorifying substance abuse in a movie that was literally about Jim Morrison  that Kilmer  committed to the Method even through casting  became too aggressive with a woman during an audition in front of Stone and the casting director as he became swept up in an emotionally charged moment. (The incident resulted in a settlement  though he maintains it was the actress who attacked him  and the casting director has said that both actors were physical with each other in the heat of this moment.) Joel Schumacher called him “psychotic” in an interview after directing him in “Batman Forever ” whose sequels Kilmer was supposed to star in. There are several different versions of why George Clooney replaced him — Kilmer says it was because of scheduling difficulties with the other movie he had a contract for  “The Saint” — but one factor was surely this assessment by its director. Multiple sources have claimed that on the set of “The Island of Doctor Moreau ” Kilmer touched his lit cigarette to a crew member’s sideburn. (He claims this was an accident that resulted from the cinematographer’s asking him to blow smoke from off camera very close to where a member of the camera crew was standing. “What kind of person would singe a fellow worker he spends 15 hours a day with  often less than a foot apart? Madness.“) This all begins to explain why it’s hard to make sense of who exactly Val Kilmer was. His whole thing is telling stories  but at this point he didn’t yet know which story he was telling. He can put it all together now far better than he ever could back then. He’d had his pick of roles  he was being offered lucrative franchises. His talent was in doubt by absolutely no one. His gift was both so overt and so subtle that he was the most memorable part of the movies he merely supported. And yet suddenly he was radioactive. He didn’t know how to handle what was happening to him. He’d gotten into acting because he wanted to perform serious roles  but the bigger they came  the more empty and cavernous too. “It was all silly to me ” he said to me in his office. “I’d been preparing to do ‘Hamlet’ for 10 years.” He always thought of himself as a character actor. He could do “a hundred different voices” and a million different impressions. “I would’ve loved to have been on ‘Saturday Night Live’ as a regular ” Kilmer said. “Fame wasn’t my priority  and I had it.” If you read his press around the time of “Batman ” all those interviews are mostly just him complaining about the suit  he liked to say it was “a battering experience” because he loves wordplay. In interviews  he brought up Tom Cruise often  particularly his inclination for movies where instead of running from their oiled  volleyball-playing forms of yesterday  Cruise ran back toward them. “I have very definitely had a different kind of career than Tom. You never know if a job has commercial success written all over it. I just think life’s too short to worry about that.” — The Los Angeles Times  Dec. 31  1993 “I have nothing against Tom Cruise  but he must have a large capacity to deal with the business side of movies.” — Details  June 1995 Interviewer: “How about Tom Cruise. You make fun of him sometimes?” Kilmer: “You can’t make fun of Tom Cruise. Poor thing.” — Interview  March 24  2011 Maybe he was jealous that Cruise was getting all those leads. Maybe he really couldn’t take the leading-man pressure. Maybe he was burned out already from all that Methoding. But that doesn’t seem right. The burnout theory ignores that he was still doing smaller roles on the side in the same magnetic way he had before: his Elvis-inspired cameo in “True Romance ” a movie in which he shines in a tiny role where they don’t even show his face  his bank robber in “Heat.” Forget that amazing shootout sequence that everyone talks about  the movie’s most mesmerizing moment is the 40-second microscene in which he watches a clerk verify that his fake license is real. No  the problem was that he had been trained to inhabit any role he could find himself in  he just couldn’t find himself in a normie  and by the time Kilmer came online as a movie star  normie roles were all there were  the ‘90s standard-issue regular guy in extraordinary circumstances. Kilmer’s greatest roles were always supporting characters. The roles of troubled men with broken souls went to the other guys because who would believe that a guy who looked like him had real troubles or a broken soul? But he couldn’t reverse course and bow out  either. By then  he had been seduced by a lifestyle. Look at his face in a tabloid photo of him and Cher circa 1984. Look at the pride  look how much he enjoyed being on Cher’s arm. It reminds him of something he heard once: “God wants us to walk  but the devil sends a limo.” He was invited to go to Toga by Tadashi Suzuki  whom he calls “the Japanese Stanislavski ” but he turned it down. He didn’t want to say yes to Hollywood  but look at that picture again: How could you say no? By the time he realized how miserable he was  it was too late. He tried to supplement these movies with other artistic endeavors that nourished his soul. He began working on a documentary about nuclear disarmament in 1983  when he was doing “Real Genius.” When he was filming “Wonderland” in 2003  as the porn star John Holmes  he holed up with Ali Alborzi  who had been a protégé of Kilmer’s friend the wildlife photographer Peter Beard  to photograph the set and then make collages of the photographs and pages from the film’s script all over the walls of the Chateau Marmont  and also spill blood all over them  a complex art project I don’t fully understand. He took the roles  always imagining that when he had enough money  he could get out with enough to support both that giant Santa Fe ranch  with its animals and staff  and the artists he wanted to invite to it. “I was gambling with being able to maintain the status  and I would’ve won my gamble  except for 2008.” Not only did he lose his status in Hollywood  but the one spoil he escaped with  his ranch  lost half its value  and he was forced to sell most of it away. “I just lost my home like a million other people. It was pretty awful.” His casting problem was solved for him when no one wanted to work with him anymore. The roles went to people who  presumably  were not known for unkindness toward movie crews  the phone stopped ringing. In his book  he sums up this period like this: “In an unflinching attempt to empower directors  actors and other collaborators to honor the truth and essence of each project  an attempt to breathe Suzukian life into a myriad of Hollywood moments  I had been deemed difficult and alienated the head of every major studio.” He says this in an attempt not to apologize (clearly) but to make clear why he behaved the way he did. “Everyone has to work out their own salvation ” he told me. “How to live and by what morality  and I found that the part that I feel bad about is hurting somebody in the process.” He remembered a story from his time as Batman. One day he was filming and about to take off the Batsuit when Warren Buffett and his grandkids came by. They wanted to see Batman  so Kilmer stuck around in the suit  but they didn’t want to talk to him. They wanted to try on the mask and ride in the Batmobile. He understood then that Batman isn’t meant to be a real guy. Batman is meant to be so anonymous that the person who is looking at him can see himself in him. “That’s why it’s so easy to have five or six Batmans ” he says now. “It’s not about Batman. There is no Batman.” And so what kind of thing is that to play  a person whose job is to be as nonspecific as possible. He looked good in the Batsuit  but wearing it was torture. When he took it off  he was finally free. See what he did there? See how it all worked out? That’s a pretty happy ending to a sad story. The lesson here is Val Kilmer’s perpetual lesson  that if you have enough faith — if you can take the long view and remember that things will work out — destiny takes over. I say that to prepare you for the story of what happened to his body  because if you think that turning the story of a blown-up career into a best-case scenario is impressive  wait till you see what the Val Kilmer story-optimizer does with cancer. So: By 2014  he was living a life he loved. He was no longer under contract for franchises he couldn’t put his heart into. He had some money  he had a place in Malibu  his kids nearby  and he could finally do what he wanted. He began to pick the projects that mattered to him. It so happens that the animated short “Mark Twain Dreams of the Resurrection” is not the first movie Kilmer has made about Mark Twain. It’s not even the second  and I’ve heard there’s an additional screenplay for a feature-length script out there  too. But the main Mark Twain event is a film called “Citizen Twain ” and it was conceived as a live performance in which Val Kilmer dresses up as Mark Twain and does Mark Twain- and Christian Science-related stand-up comedy. Take a minute with that sentence. I went to see “Citizen Twain” one rainy Friday night at the College of Staten Island  a half-filled theater  which I remember a little like a fever dream. There’s not a lot of marketing copy that can prepare you for its strangeness  and also its elaborateness  and also its sincerity  and also the delightful warmth of Val Kilmer  whom you will never see happier than when he is presenting this film of his — though it started out as a half-filmed  half-live performance  it is now  in light of his vocal condition  a totally filmed performance that Kilmer merely introduces. The subjects of “Citizen Twain” range from sarsaparilla to congressional representatives being idiots  from Mark Twain quotes to Mrs. Eddy quotes to quotes Val Kilmer only wishes either of them had said. Here he was  using his celebrity and his talent  along with some heavy rubber prosthetics — Mark Twain was many things  but he was not a person who looked like Val Kilmer — to finally do something he wanted  which was to work out for himself the relationship of two people he absolutely worshiped but who were at odds in almost every way. Samuel Clemens was a Christian and a rational man who seemed fairly appalled at Mrs. Eddy’s interpretation of the Bible and its assumptions that healing from illness was something resulting from prayer  rather than medical treatment. He wrote a book about it called “Christian Science ” in which he clearly mocks all of it. But Kilmer believes he did this only because he was so drawn to it. With each project  Kilmer gets a little closer to making the universe conform a little bit more to what he wishes it were: a place where the two historical figures he loves most  Mark Twain and Mrs. Eddy  are finally no longer polar opposites but magnetically aligned. Val Kilmer can’t remember when it was that Mark Twain first re-entered his life. And he certainly doesn’t know when he first realized that his life’s work would be about trying to meld the visions of Mark Twain and Mrs. Eddy into one. And he certainly can’t remember the year he started having symptoms of what other people (the ones with medical degrees who evaluated him) called throat cancer. Partly this is because he gets tired when he talks now  but mostly it’s because it’s hard to track time and mark space when you don’t believe in them. As near as I can tell  in 2014  as he was touring with “Citizen Twain ” Kilmer found himself in Nashville with a big lump in his throat. He was having a hard time swallowing. He canceled the show. He’d been having symptoms for a while and had woken up in a pool of his own blood a time or two back in Malibu. A doctor eventually told him it was throat cancer  or as Kilmer told me Christian Science calls it  the “suggestion of throat cancer.” Meaning that in Christian Science  “the idea is rather than say I have it or possess it  there is a claim  there’s a suggestion that this is a fact.” He knew the cure for him would be to work with his practitioner  Christian Science’s version of a spiritual adviser  to pray his fear away so that his body would no longer “manifest outwardly what can be diagnosed as a malady.” Meaning it’s not really cancer. It’s just his fear expressing itself — think of what he’d just been through losing all his land  reckoning with his career. He had to go away and pray to relocate his faith within himself. But it wasn’t so easy. He has kids  a grown son and daughter he had while he was still married to Joanne Whalley  and they’re not Christian Scientists. His family couldn’t let him go heal by himself  cancer  as they know it  is a thing that spreads. He relented. “I just didn’t want to experience their fear  which was profound ” Kilmer said. “I would’ve had to go away  and I just didn’t want to be without them.” He had surgery that year  which was followed by chemotherapy and radiation “that zapped my whole throat  and it’s still dry as a bone” and left him with the tracheostomy tube and a feeding tube. Shortly after  Kilmer was spotted wearing scarves  his head slightly askew  as if his neck couldn’t properly hold it up. In 2016  Michael Douglas was doing a press junket after his own bout of cancer  and a reporter asked him about “The Ghost and the Darkness.” Douglas mentioned that Kilmer  his co-star in that movie  was suffering from the same illness he had suffered from. Kilmer denied this  posting on Facebook that he had “no cancer whatsoever.” I asked Kilmer why he said he didn’t have cancer  when it seemed to me  judging by the fact that the thing he described is absolutely the treatment for throat cancer  that he perhaps definitely did. He said  “Because I didn’t have cancer.” I blinked a few times. “They said I was denying that I had cancer  and when they asked me  I didn’t have cancer. It was a bit like do you have a broken bone? And if you broke it in high school  you would say no.” He continued: “Suddenly suspect. I have had a bone broken  but why are you being so aggressive? I had a bone broken. It was broken in my leg. ‘Oh  so you have a broken leg.’ ‘No  no  I don’t ’ I say. I did have a broken leg.” It’s not exactly mind over matter. It is  he tells me  the lost art of Christian healing. ”‘There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so ’” he said  quoting Mrs. Eddy quoting “Hamlet.” “I prayed  and that was my form of treatment.” The doctors did those other things  but it was the prayer that worked  he’s sure. He is no longer suffering from cancer  he said. Or rather  he never was. No  he’s suffering from something quite different. He pointed at his trach tube. “That’s from radiation and chemotherapy. It’s not from cancer.” His prayer  he said  was the true treatment  the medical response to cancer was the thing that hurt him. “That ‘treatment’ caused my suffering.” The next day  Kilmer sat at a conference table in HelMel and opened up a red Igloo cooler and began to mix liquids together from various canisters before putting them into a syringe. He opened his shirt  uncapped his feeding port and injected the food into a tube. It was lunchtime. He has no vices anymore. He watches all the food shows — “Top Chef ” “Chef’s Table ” “Ugly Delicious” — yearning for the time he’ll be able to eat again  though it has been years and he’s not sure how much longer it will be. When it is  though  he said  making his arms into a food-shoveling gesture  “I’m going to look like Orson Welles.” He’s 61 now. He is still so handsome. His hair is still blond. His eyes are still the unimaginable green of Oregon grass right after the rain. His jaw is still the main event — the nasolabial area of his cheek bookending the inferior jowl so that his superior jowl appears sunken and his face takes on romantic geological proportions. He was wearing a very heavy turquoise and coral necklace that his mother  who died last year  wore for 20 years straight  along with her turquoise bracelet. He was never scared during his medical treatment  he told me  he never panicked. Right as he was graduating from high school  his younger brother  Wesley  who had received a diagnosis of epilepsy  drowned in the family’s Jacuzzi. Wesley had been a “supergenius ” he said  a gifted filmmaker who made stop-motion animation ahead of his time. But Kilmer still talks to Wesley. Wesley shows up in his office  and they hash things out or trade ideas. His mother has appeared to him lately  too  as if “she’s at a party  saying how happy she is to be with her husband again and Wesley  my little brother  so happy.” Death isn’t death in Christian Science. It’s simply that humans have limitations  and one of them is that we perceive people only through our five senses. When a person dies  they aren’t gone. They are just not showing up in our senses anymore. So if a Christian Scientist prays and still dies (according to standard definitions of death)  it doesn’t mean the prayer didn’t work. As Kilmer said when he was dressed up as Mark Twain  all prayers work: “It’s just that sometimes we don’t like the answer.” So how can you be scared of cancer when there’s no such thing as cancer? How can you fear death when there’s no such thing as death? The answer is you can’t. “Someone comes up to you and says you have only four months to live  and the concept of time is a human one. So  if you describe the divine concept of time  there is no time.” He’s been off the trach tube a couple of times  though each time  he has a setback: a cough  a cold  a fever. But why all this talk about the time that fear manifested in his body? He addressed it. He made it through that  and now he’s on the other side  and his life is finally what he wanted it to be. By the time I met him  he had taken “Citizen Twain” to more than 30 cities. “I feel like I could not possibly be in a better place for attracting better and better roles ” he said. “If an actor is fortunate enough to do so  to steer their own course and own their own material  they control their own destiny  creating their own products.” He talked about how Irwin Winkler and Francis Ford Coppola had each leveraged their wealth to get projects made. His slate these days is no different. “I haven’t picked subjects such as boxing  jealousy or uncontrollable madness. Mark Twain and Mary Baker Eddy are the subjects of the film I’ve dedicated 20 years of my life to  on and off.” He told me he’s filmed five roles so far this year. The opportunities are coming in the way they do only when you’re peaceful and not desperate about them. There’s a “Top Gun” sequel coming out this year. Kilmer is in it. He’s not allowed to say anything about the new “Top Gun” except that he’s in it. And that instead of being enemies with Maverick  their relationship has changed. “We’re friends ” he said. “This time we’re friends.” As I walked out of HelMel that day  Kilmer presented me with a gift: It was the abstract painting I admired the day before  with the swimmers diving into the waves. I told him I couldn’t take it — that Times policy was that I couldn’t accept anything even close to this. I put it down. He picked it up. I put it on a desk. He told Brad Koepenick  who stayed with us until the end of the interviews  to carry it out to my car and not let me leave without it. So I took it and put it in the passenger seat with a seatbelt around it  just me and Val Kilmer’s abstract swimmer art driving down Melrose  and honestly  I felt so good and so weightless — spending the day with someone who doesn’t believe in death is as fine an antidote to hearing all the stories of fear that were coming through the radio now as any — that instead of passing Cahuenga Boulevard back to my hotel  I hung a right and went to the movies  the way I used to when I was young. I sat in the movie theater  watching “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” and thinking of stories Kilmer told me: about an accident his daughter was in  how she was walking and got hit by a car on Little Santa Monica and then thrown through a storefront window  but the storefront had been evacuated and so was empty  and even though she’d gone through the glass  she emerged unscathed  about a time he was driving to the airport from his ranch and a car wandered through the median  and he was going too fast to stop  and so his car went through this other car without colliding with it. He can still see the mole on the driver’s neck as he went through him without causing material disturbance to either of their bodies or vehicles. These things happened because he’d been praying his whole life. But the other thing he’d been doing his whole life was telling these stories  turning the way we are constantly walking along the edge of our imminent demise — sure  imminent if you believe in time  demise if you believe in death — and trying to make sense of what could happen to a person at any given moment: a religious person  a person who is trying to be good in the world. That his daughter could be hit by a car? That he could die on the way to the airport? That his reputation could be shattered? That he could have a hole in his throat? Who could blame a person who needed to make sense of the chaotic turns of his life with a story? But even more: What else was he supposed to do? When he told me those stories  I told him it was hard for me to imagine that a person could heal themselves or prevent certain disaster with prayer. He said  “It’s not that difficult.” When he said that  I realized that as the days had gone on  it had become easier to understand him. The Times was calling for staff members to return to base and begin working from home  so I headed to the airport the next morning with my suitcase and my painting  which I promised myself I would mail back to Kilmer when I arrived at home. People were wearing masks on my flight and sanitizing the cups of soda they received during in-flight service  and I drifted off to sleep feeling bad for them. South by Southwest was canceled before I even landed. Cannes was postponed. Eventually  the Olympics were too. In the coming weeks  everything was canceled: school  outside  hugs. Peter Beard went missing  and Kilmer took a walk with Ali Alborzi  who was distraught. It was the longest walk Kilmer had taken in a long time  and he realized that two hummingbirds had been following him  had been following them for three days. “Birds have always been a part of my family ” Kilmer texted me. “Being the harbingers of life and the story of death.” He believed the hummingbirds had a message for them about Beard. By then  I thought  “How beautiful.” Perhaps we had created the coronavirus out of our fear and wickedness — children in cages  the rich hoarding wealth  perhaps we had only the suggestion of a virus. I grew up with too many messianics in my household. I found this kind of thing too easy to believe  if only because it was more believable than the fact that in 2020  my young  healthy colleagues were in the hospital  the streets were bare  I was stuck inside my house and nobody knew how long that might go on for. For a few days  I stared at my beautiful painting  which I will absolutely return when it’s safe to take a nonessential trip to the post office. It was so hard to parse all the fear that permeated society now — what was real and what had come as a result of our own hysteria. During the day I’d think that it was the fear that was hurting us most. But at night my husband would shake me to wake me up because I’d been crying in my sleep. More quickly than I could have imagined  the world took on the hallucinogenic quality of right before you fall asleep  when everything is outsize and nothing makes sense. The margins on my suspension of disbelief started to close in on themselves  and the borders of things began to diminish  and now the world seemed like a word you stare at so long that it becomes nonsense. I watched all the Val Kilmer movies again  but this time they struck me as representations of a world that never existed  that couldn’t possibly exist: What is sweaty shirtless fighter pilot? What is dentist with tuberculosis? What is Downtown L.A. shootout? What is Batmobile? What is Lizard King? Amid all this  I received a phone call. One of my closest and oldest friends  Lydia  called me to tell me she had throat cancer. I had seen her a few weeks before  and she told me she had been having bouts of laryngitis. But now she had a diagnosis. It was Stage 0 — it had not yet spread. I cried into the phone with her. But also here I was  finding this out while writing an article about a man who had throat cancer. I called up Kilmer and told him about Lydia. I asked if he had any advice to give her. He did. Kilmer told me she could “have a healing at any minute. It could happen right now  or when she’s on her way to the hospital  or even while a doctor is operating on her.” I called her and told her this  and it made us both giddy for some reason. But then  a few days later  her surgery was postponed because of the coronavirus  and we aren’t sure  even as of this writing  when it will happen  and now her cancer might spread. I felt stupid for trying to find meaning and hope in what was happening to Lydia  I felt stupid for trying to make this into a story for her and for us. In just two weeks  the palm trees against the bright blue sky that hung over HelMel seemed like something I made up  as weird to think about as a Batman figure with a Mark Twain head. (Was that even real? I searched my phone and found a picture of it. Phew.) By now I understood that the story I was telling about Val Kilmer  which I’d thought had been about a man’s relentless faith and optimism  was really about reconciliation: the squaring of two opposing things into something we swear is true despite all evidence to the contrary. Your beauty can sentence you to misery  Val Kilmer uses a tracheostomy tube  but he can talk  his brother is dead but only to our senses. Mark Twain despised Mary Baker Eddy  until you can will him into a dream where he doesn’t. God is good  and there are no ventilators. My beautiful friend has cancer  and the treatment exists  but it’s unavailable to her right now. Here’s the thing: Mark Twain  Kilmer’s favorite storyteller  thought that storytelling couldn’t (and shouldn’t) try to capture an entire life  to draw its arc  to determine its meaning. He was suspicious of the kind of autobiography that Ben Franklin had done. He thought it should just be a mishmash of remembrances told not even in the right order lest a person be tempted to force a story into a certain direction and make themselves a more sympathetic character than they deserve. Here’s another thing: I spoke to his daughter  Mercedes  who told me that she did have a miraculous recovery  but that a bone in her face had been broken and that she was in a wheelchair for a month and required major surgery. I spoke to Val Kilmer one more time. While we were on the phone  I stared at my painting  the divers diving in over and over — What is HelMel? What is ocean? — and I tried to remember how I felt when it was beside me in Los Angeles  in the passenger seat of the rental car. Kilmer told me that he and Alborzi were going to get in a car and drive to New Mexico  where he still has 160 acres of land. Meanwhile  Tom Cruise tweeted that the “Top Gun” sequel was moving to December  two of my colleagues were in the hospital and another’s husband lay in his bed gasping for breath. I attended a Zoom shiva for a friend’s mother  who was buried alone. Peter Beard lay in the woods  weeks away from being found. The Val Kilmer GIF snapped its jaw over and over forever in a text message. Lydia waited by the phone though she had not been told to expect a call  and Val Kilmer planned his road trip into the desert. transcript Hi  It’s Taffy Brodesser-Akner  and I’m a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine. I have been trying to write a story about Val Kilmer for about five years. He was the quintessential blockbuster matinee movie idol of my youth. He was in — You guys really are cowboys. What’s your problem  Kazansky? — “Top Gun.” I don’t like you because you’re dangerous. That’s right! Ice ... man. Let’s just say I was testing the bounds of reality. He starred as Jim Morrison in “The Doors.” He was Batman! The bat-signal is not a beeper. Well  I wish I could say that my interest in you was ... purely professional. And then one day he stopped showing up in movies. All of a sudden  I realized it had been a really long time since I’d seen Val Kilmer on a big screen. So I thought I was telling a story about where Val Kilmer was. But by the time he finally agreed to speak with me earlier this year  I found a completely different story there. It turns out that Val Kilmer is a man of extraordinary faith. And the reason that that matters is because in the years since I had started asking to speak with him  a lot of things had changed and so had I. I had been raised in a house of tremendous religious observance beyond just kind of traditional Judaism  there was a lot of Kabbalistic mysticism. And along with that  a belief that was instilled in me that no matter what  everything was going to be OK. And in the last five years  I have really lost track of that. I no longer believe it. And so the story about Val Kilmer went from being a story about where he went and turned into a story about someone who still believes that. I don’t know if it could change anybody from being terrified about the state of the world  but I know that it will not hurt anybody to spend a few minutes remembering that there are other ways to look at things. So here’s my story  “The Iceman in Winter ” read for you by Julia Whelan. It’s hard to believe now  as I write this  but just two months ago  when we were allowed to roam free  when we could board planes and alight from them and wander into rental cars and check into hotels — when we could chase down and replenish the beauty and wonder our very cells need to survive — I went to Los Angeles  where I was asked this question by Val Kilmer: “Do you think South by Southwest will be canceled?” But Val Kilmer no longer sounds like Val Kilmer  the movie star of the ‘80s and ‘90s who has mostly vanished from screens. He hasn’t since his tracheostomy. He can still squeeze air up through his windpipe  however  and past the hole that was cut into his throat and the tracheostomy tube  in a way that makes him somewhat understood — not very  but somewhat. The sound is something between a squeak and a voiceless roar. He says the fact that I can understand him is a result of the endless vocal exercises that he was trained to do when he went to Juilliard after high school  that he was taught to work his voice “like it was a trumpet.” He hated the authoritarian rule at Juilliard while he was there  he hated those stupid vocal exercises. Now look at him  still using his most beloved instrument when really  by all rights  it should be useless. See how it all turned out for the best? All Val Kilmer’s stories are like that  told with that same dash of preordained kismet. He was traveling in Africa in 1994 when he decided to spend a morning exploring a bat cave  later that day  literally seriously that day  he was inspired to call his agent  who had been trying to contact Kilmer for weeks to see if he was interested in playing the role of Batman  now that Michael Keaton was hanging it up. Another story: In the days before he set eyes for the first time on his (now ex-) wife  Joanne Whalley  he dreamed that he met the woman he was destined for and woke up and immediately wrote a poem called  “We’ve Just Met but Marry Me Please.” Then right after that  he went to London  and while he was there  he saw a play  and Whalley was in it. He was so taken with her that he followed her to the pub after-party just so he could look at her. This was crazy even for him  so he made no move. But two years later  in 1987  she would be randomly coincidentally serendipitously cast opposite him in “Willow ” and they would end up married. So yes  he can talk  and it’s such a miracle that he has these abilities  because if you have enough faith  you’ll see how every part of your life is just a piece of a bigger part of your life  and nothing is an accident  and everything is good. We were in his office at HelMel  an office space/art gallery/artists’ studio/retail museum for Val Kilmer’s movie career that takes up several storefronts and more than half the block of Melrose Avenue between Edgemont Street and Heliotrope Drive in Hollywood. Officially  according to Brad Koepenick  his childhood friend and adult business associate  who was in the room to help me better understand Kilmer  HelMel’s mission is to serve as “a fun  sacred space where eclectic artists gather with novices to collaborate  and through new technology  inspire change and spark giving in our local underserved community.” One is a traditional art gallery. Another is a dark window display with three black cubes that say GOD stenciled in white paint  behind which is an inventory of merch from Kilmer’s long and storied movie career — socks that featured his “Tombstone” character  Doc Holliday  and Jim Morrison coasters from his role in “The Doors” and some paintings that Kilmer himself created  some of which are about his film career (a rendering of his “Top Gun” character  Iceman  with the word “LOVE” stenciled across it) and some that aren’t (a hummingbird in a forest). The final storefront is a door that leads to the Willy Wonka core of HelMel. Inside there’s a podcasting studio  a cafe area and a screening room. HelMel also houses a foundation Val and Koepenick created called TwainMania  which aims to send its Mark Twain curriculum into schools. Twice a week  high school students from South Central Los Angeles practice “Hamlet” and other plays there as part of a program called Inner City Shakespeare. HelMel started holding events last February: a screening of “Tombstone ” an Echo in the Canyon concert. It is the creative incubator of Kilmer’s dreams — the fruition of a vision he had always hoped his 6 000-acre New Mexico ranch would be before he lost most of it in the 2008 housing crash. “The idea is to create kind of a life that’s active ” Kilmer told me. “It’s active. It’s alive. I want the feel of it being alive. You feel the electricity.” He sat at his desk. Behind him was a replica of a painting he had sold to Robert Downey Jr. and  on the other side  a maybe two-foot-tall Batman figure with a Mark Twain head. Elsewhere were Apple computers from the 1980s and 1990s dipped in glossy red paint  a tumbleweed bathed in gold paint. There was a box of newly shipped hardcovers of his new memoir  “I’m Your Huckleberry ” which debuted on the best-seller list in April  a brooding photo of the Val Kilmer of your 1990s matinee memories on its cover. On the walls were more of his paintings  swishes of paint and resin and oil (and sometimes spray paint) on sheets of repurposed aluminum. He makes them by swirling around the chemicals and paint until they look like an emotion or an element to him  at which point he adds a photograph  solidifying his theory into fact. I stood and admired a rectangle of blue-gray haze that he had determined looked like ocean waves  and so he had added photos of swimmers  diving into the waves  one after another. Of all the projects going on inside the studio at that minute  it was a short animated film about Mark Twain that concerned him most. In it  Mark Twain falls asleep and dreams of the resurrection of Jesus Christ  resulting in his waking up and realizing that Mary Baker Eddy  the founder of Christian Science — Val Kilmer is a lifelong Christian Scientist — was correct about God’s eminent perfection and the theories of Mrs. Eddy  as Kilmer calls her  about God’s capacity to heal. Kilmer loves a lot of things  but two of the tops are Mark Twain and Mrs. Eddy. Kilmer wanted to debut the short at South by Southwest in a few weeks. It was early March. There were rumors that festivals and concerts and even air travel might be canceled. Kilmer believed that even if he and his team couldn’t take an airplane  they could just drive to Austin and still screen “Mark Twain Dreams of the Resurrection” and  I don’t know  will the festival into existence. He was undaunted by all the signs and portents that made it feel as if the world were dropping to its knees  he believed if he could get the film done and over to Austin  the rest would take care of itself. So when he asked me if South by Southwest would be canceled  I told him I didn’t know. The surgeon general had started asking the public not to hoard surgical masks  and just that morning  Los Angeles had declared a state of emergency. “You don’t think we will be going to Cannes?” Kilmer asked. “How about the Olympics? The Olympics has never been canceled except in time of world war.” You can’t cancel the world  right? Bad things happen  but you still need art. Right? Right! You still need art. You still need forward momentum. You still need to believe that all your effort wasn’t for nothing  that we could — we will — survive a dark moment in history and that when that happens  we won’t be left without the things that made those moments decipherable and meaningful and therefore tolerable. The world outside had seemed to be getting so  so bad for so  so long  and this was the first whiff of overarching hope and positivity that I’d witnessed in I couldn’t remember how many months or years now — so much so that I almost couldn’t identify it when I saw it. The last glowing embers of hope coming from Val Kilmer? The movie hunk of my youth  who disappeared unceremoniously and now presented with an entirely different appearance and a bizarre accounting of where he’d been? But there was something familiar about it  like a faint knocking that came from inside me: It was the special kind of optimism that maybe only the faithful have  the enduring belief that some force will come along and save us from the centrifuge of despair we’ve found ourselves in. When is the last time you saw that up close? Before you can understand the story of what happened to Val Kilmer  you have to determine for yourself who he was in the first place. Trying to compare him to any movie star working either now or then will fry your mental circuit board: He was an upwardly mobile conventional movie star  he was equally a fringe weirdo who would soon disappear. His first movie  “Top Secret!” (1984)  about a rock star in East Berlin  was the follow-up to “Airplane!” by its creative team  and it was so funny  and such a strange thing to see this extraordinarily handsome young kid — a jaw like the sharp-cut bottom half of a stop sign  that true-Swede golden hair  a Cupid’s bow that lays in shadow of the plump convex swoop of his upper lip — who also seemed to be in on the joke. The ‘80s were a time when a handsome young man with blond hair was mostly the butt of it. He’d been on the road to something slightly more  say  classical when he was at Juilliard. He starred in “Orestes” and in “The Wood Demon.” He wrote a play with his classmates called “How It All Began ” which went on to run for a month at the Public Theater after Joe Papp himself saw it at the school. He starred in “Slab Boys” with Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon. He did “As You Like It” in Minneapolis with Patti LuPone. But once Hollywood got a look at him  he was on too-fast a conveyor belt to safely step off. The success of “Top Secret!” begat a somewhat-starring role in “Real Genius ” meaning that his Chris Knight  the apathetic  irresistible prodigy who helps something laser chemical transmitter radio something  is the guy on the poster  but he’s not the character with the clearest narrative arc  he’s more of a wise fool in the Shakespeare tradition. Another hit. Then in 1986 came “Top Gun ” and after that  everyone knew who Val Kilmer was. Because how could you not? Iceman  the fighter pilot Tom Cruise’s Maverick is trying to best for the “best of the best” of the best position  has maybe 17 words in the whole movie  but it is there that you can see Val Kilmer’s greatest gift  which is to make something out of nothing — to breathe real life into a character who was only there to set the volleyball so that Maverick could spike it. If you asked me then what beguiled me about Val Kilmer  I wouldn’t have had the words for it. Instead  I would have pictured a man without a shirt (I am still hard-pressed to picture young Val Kilmer in a regular shirt)  but it wasn’t his body that stuck with me when the lights came on. No  it was his awesome physicality  him spinning that volleyball on his finger  him offering the most fraught ‘80s masculinity-soaked condolences ever when Maverick’s radar intercept officer  Goose  buys it during a flight exercise — there was something in his immense focus and his full-bodied commitment to just plain Being-in-the-Scene that took my breath away. I read somewhere that Kilmer was so dedicated to inhabiting the role that he created Team Iceman and Team Maverick factions in the “Top Gun” movie cast. What I also remember is Iceman’s snapping his gum with his mighty jaw in nonresponse to Maverick’s admitting that yes  he’s dangerous. In that jaw snap — which is my absolute favorite GIF to send to people — there’s so much more than a weird way to end a conversation: It’s arrogance and pathos  frustration and whatever the emotion is where you know that laughing at someone will hurt them more than insulting them. The next few jobs came relatively quickly: the crazed  greedy  delightful Madmartigan in “Willow ” shouting epithets at the hero of the story with a vitality and electricity that makes you somehow root for him  “Kill Me Again ” in which he plays a dumb investigator who becomes the mark of a con woman (played by his wife at the time  Joanne Whalley)  “The Doors ” an Oliver Stone movie made extremely watchable by Kilmer’s Method performance as Jim Morrison  so Methody and deep in the role  it’s not so long into any kind of rewatching of that movie that I realize I can no longer remember what real Jim Morrison sounded or looked like. Then the beloved “Tombstone ” in which he once again went deep Method on the tubercular dentist  Doc Holliday  sweaty and yellow  gasping for breath through his puffs on his cigarette. It was around this time that both Kilmer and his viewing public ran into a problem. If you’re good at acting  and you’re superhunky  and you look good with your shirt off and also are willing to take it off  you are an excellent candidate for a promotion  and so Val Kilmer leveled up. Pretty soon  he was cast as pure leads of what were or were designed to be blockbusters: “Batman Forever ” “The Island of Dr. Moreau ” “The Saint.” He didn’t do badly in any of those roles  exactly. It’s more as if all the elements were there  but they couldn’t unite to make a real person — the whole was less than the sum of its parts. His Jack Andrews in “Kill Me Again” is supposed to be some kind of Everyman  but he’s really the absence of a person  a body without a soul. In “Thunderheart ” Kilmer plays a regular-guy F.B.I. agent with some Native American lineage  and I couldn’t really get through the rest. In “Batman Forever ” he barely moves his face  and well  here were the reviews: Janet Maslin in this newspaper said Kilmer was “hamstrung by the straight-man aspects of the role ” while Roger Ebert raved that he was “completely acceptable.” There came reports of problems on sets — that he was complaining constantly and making impossible demands  that he was rude to his co-stars and stayed in character all the time  never bothering with even small courtesies to the other people on set. That he fought with Oliver Stone about glorifying substance abuse in a movie that was literally about Jim Morrison  that Kilmer  committed to the Method even through casting  became too aggressive with a woman during an audition in front of Stone and the casting director as he became swept up in an emotionally charged moment. (The incident resulted in a settlement  though he maintains it was the actress who attacked him  and the casting director has said that both actors were physical with each other in the heat of this moment.) Joel Schumacher called him “psychotic” in an interview after directing him in “Batman Forever ” whose sequels Kilmer was supposed to star in. There are several different versions of why George Clooney replaced him — Kilmer says it was because of scheduling difficulties with the other movie he had a contract for  “The Saint” — but one factor was surely this assessment by its director. Multiple sources have claimed that on the set of “The Island of Doctor Moreau ” Kilmer touched his lit cigarette to a crew member’s sideburn. (He claims this was an accident that resulted from the cinematographer’s asking him to blow smoke from off camera very close to where a member of the camera crew was standing. “What kind of person would singe a fellow worker he spends 15 hours a day with  often less than a foot apart? Madness.“) This all begins to explain why it’s hard to make sense of who exactly Val Kilmer was. His whole thing is telling stories  but at this point he didn’t yet know which story he was telling. He can put it all together now far better than he ever could back then. He’d had his pick of roles  he was being offered lucrative franchises. His talent was in doubt by absolutely no one. His gift was both so overt and so subtle that he was the most memorable part of the movies he merely supported. And yet suddenly he was radioactive. He didn’t know how to handle what was happening to him. He’d gotten into acting because he wanted to perform serious roles  but the bigger they came  the more empty and cavernous too. “It was all silly to me ” he said to me in his office. “I’d been preparing to do ‘Hamlet’ for 10 years.” He always thought of himself as a character actor. He could do “a hundred different voices” and a million different impressions. “I would’ve loved to have been on ‘Saturday Night Live’ as a regular ” Kilmer said. “Fame wasn’t my priority  and I had it.” If you read his press around the time of “Batman ” all those interviews are mostly just him complaining about the suit  he liked to say it was “a battering experience” because he loves wordplay. In interviews  he brought up Tom Cruise often  particularly his inclination for movies where instead of running from their oiled  volleyball-playing forms of yesterday  Cruise ran back toward them. “I have very definitely had a different kind of career than Tom. You never know if a job has commercial success written all over it. I just think life’s too short to worry about that.” — The Los Angeles Times  Dec. 31  1993 “I have nothing against Tom Cruise  but he must have a large capacity to deal with the business side of movies.” — Details  June 1995 Interviewer: “How about Tom Cruise. You make fun of him sometimes?” Kilmer: “You can’t make fun of Tom Cruise. Poor thing.” — Interview  March 24  2011 Maybe he was jealous that Cruise was getting all those leads. Maybe he really couldn’t take the leading-man pressure. Maybe he was burned out already from all that Methoding. But that doesn’t seem right. The burnout theory ignores that he was still doing smaller roles on the side in the same magnetic way he had before: his Elvis-inspired cameo in “True Romance ” a movie in which he shines in a tiny role where they don’t even show his face  his bank robber in “Heat.” Forget that amazing shootout sequence that everyone talks about  the movie’s most mesmerizing moment is the 40-second microscene in which he watches a clerk verify that his fake license is real. No  the problem was that he had been trained to inhabit any role he could find himself in  he just couldn’t find himself in a normie  and by the time Kilmer came online as a movie star  normie roles were all there were  the ‘90s standard-issue regular guy in extraordinary circumstances. Kilmer’s greatest roles were always supporting characters. The roles of troubled men with broken souls went to the other guys because who would believe that a guy who looked like him had real troubles or a broken soul? But he couldn’t reverse course and bow out  either. By then  he had been seduced by a lifestyle. Look at his face in a tabloid photo of him and Cher circa 1984. Look at the pride  look how much he enjoyed being on Cher’s arm. It reminds him of something he heard once: “God wants us to walk  but the devil sends a limo.” He was invited to go to Toga by Tadashi Suzuki  whom he calls “the Japanese Stanislavski ” but he turned it down. He didn’t want to say yes to Hollywood  but look at that picture again: How could you say no? By the time he realized how miserable he was  it was too late. He tried to supplement these movies with other artistic endeavors that nourished his soul. He began working on a documentary about nuclear disarmament in 1983  when he was doing “Real Genius.” When he was filming “Wonderland” in 2003  as the porn star John Holmes  he holed up with Ali Alborzi  who had been a protégé of Kilmer’s friend the wildlife photographer Peter Beard  to photograph the set and then make collages of the photographs and pages from the film’s script all over the walls of the Chateau Marmont  and also spill blood all over them  a complex art project I don’t fully understand. He took the roles  always imagining that when he had enough money  he could get out with enough to support both that giant Santa Fe ranch  with its animals and staff  and the artists he wanted to invite to it. “I was gambling with being able to maintain the status  and I would’ve won my gamble  except for 2008.” Not only did he lose his status in Hollywood  but the one spoil he escaped with  his ranch  lost half its value  and he was forced to sell most of it away. “I just lost my home like a million other people. It was pretty awful.” His casting problem was solved for him when no one wanted to work with him anymore. The roles went to people who  presumably  were not known for unkindness toward movie crews  the phone stopped ringing. In his book  he sums up this period like this: “In an unflinching attempt to empower directors  actors and other collaborators to honor the truth and essence of each project  an attempt to breathe Suzukian life into a myriad of Hollywood moments  I had been deemed difficult and alienated the head of every major studio.” He says this in an attempt not to apologize (clearly) but to make clear why he behaved the way he did. “Everyone has to work out their own salvation ” he told me. “How to live and by what morality  and I found that the part that I feel bad about is hurting somebody in the process.” He remembered a story from his time as Batman. One day he was filming and about to take off the Batsuit when Warren Buffett and his grandkids came by. They wanted to see Batman  so Kilmer stuck around in the suit  but they didn’t want to talk to him. They wanted to try on the mask and ride in the Batmobile. He understood then that Batman isn’t meant to be a real guy. Batman is meant to be so anonymous that the person who is looking at him can see himself in him. “That’s why it’s so easy to have five or six Batmans ” he says now. “It’s not about Batman. There is no Batman.” And so what kind of thing is that to play  a person whose job is to be as nonspecific as possible. He looked good in the Batsuit  but wearing it was torture. When he took it off  he was finally free. See what he did there? See how it all worked out? That’s a pretty happy ending to a sad story. The lesson here is Val Kilmer’s perpetual lesson  that if you have enough faith — if you can take the long view and remember that things will work out — destiny takes over. I say that to prepare you for the story of what happened to his body  because if you think that turning the story of a blown-up career into a best-case scenario is impressive  wait till you see what the Val Kilmer story-optimizer does with cancer. So: By 2014  he was living a life he loved. He was no longer under contract for franchises he couldn’t put his heart into. He had some money  he had a place in Malibu  his kids nearby  and he could finally do what he wanted. He began to pick the projects that mattered to him. It so happens that the animated short “Mark Twain Dreams of the Resurrection” is not the first movie Kilmer has made about Mark Twain. It’s not even the second  and I’ve heard there’s an additional screenplay for a feature-length script out there  too. But the main Mark Twain event is a film called “Citizen Twain ” and it was conceived as a live performance in which Val Kilmer dresses up as Mark Twain and does Mark Twain- and Christian Science-related stand-up comedy. Take a minute with that sentence. I went to see “Citizen Twain” one rainy Friday night at the College of Staten Island  a half-filled theater  which I remember a little like a fever dream. There’s not a lot of marketing copy that can prepare you for its strangeness  and also its elaborateness  and also its sincerity  and also the delightful warmth of Val Kilmer  whom you will never see happier than when he is presenting this film of his — though it started out as a half-filmed  half-live performance  it is now  in light of his vocal condition  a totally filmed performance that Kilmer merely introduces. The subjects of “Citizen Twain” range from sarsaparilla to congressional representatives being idiots  from Mark Twain quotes to Mrs. Eddy quotes to quotes Val Kilmer only wishes either of them had said. Here he was  using his celebrity and his talent  along with some heavy rubber prosthetics — Mark Twain was many things  but he was not a person who looked like Val Kilmer — to finally do something he wanted  which was to work out for himself the relationship of two people he absolutely worshiped but who were at odds in almost every way. Samuel Clemens was a Christian and a rational man who seemed fairly appalled at Mrs. Eddy’s interpretation of the Bible and its assumptions that healing from illness was something resulting from prayer  rather than medical treatment. He wrote a book about it called “Christian Science ” in which he clearly mocks all of it. But Kilmer believes he did this only because he was so drawn to it. With each project  Kilmer gets a little closer to making the universe conform a little bit more to what he wishes it were: a place where the two historical figures he loves most  Mark Twain and Mrs. Eddy  are finally no longer polar opposites but magnetically aligned. Val Kilmer can’t remember when it was that Mark Twain first re-entered his life. And he certainly doesn’t know when he first realized that his life’s work would be about trying to meld the visions of Mark Twain and Mrs. Eddy into one. And he certainly can’t remember the year he started having symptoms of what other people (the ones with medical degrees who evaluated him) called throat cancer. Partly this is because he gets tired when he talks now  but mostly it’s because it’s hard to track time and mark space when you don’t believe in them. As near as I can tell  in 2014  as he was touring with “Citizen Twain ” Kilmer found himself in Nashville with a big lump in his throat. He was having a hard time swallowing. He canceled the show. He’d been having symptoms for a while and had woken up in a pool of his own blood a time or two back in Malibu. A doctor eventually told him it was throat cancer  or as Kilmer told me Christian Science calls it  the “suggestion of throat cancer.” Meaning that in Christian Science  “the idea is rather than say I have it or possess it  there is a claim  there’s a suggestion that this is a fact.” He knew the cure for him would be to work with his practitioner  Christian Science’s version of a spiritual adviser  to pray his fear away so that his body would no longer “manifest outwardly what can be diagnosed as a malady.” Meaning it’s not really cancer. It’s just his fear expressing itself — think of what he’d just been through losing all his land  reckoning with his career. He had to go away and pray to relocate his faith within himself. But it wasn’t so easy. He has kids  a grown son and daughter he had while he was still married to Joanne Whalley  and they’re not Christian Scientists. His family couldn’t let him go heal by himself  cancer  as they know it  is a thing that spreads. He relented. “I just didn’t want to experience their fear  which was profound ” Kilmer said. “I would’ve had to go away  and I just didn’t want to be without them.” He had surgery that year  which was followed by chemotherapy and radiation “that zapped my whole throat  and it’s still dry as a bone” and left him with the tracheostomy tube and a feeding tube. Shortly after  Kilmer was spotted wearing scarves  his head slightly askew  as if his neck couldn’t properly hold it up. In 2016  Michael Douglas was doing a press junket after his own bout of cancer  and a reporter asked him about “The Ghost and the Darkness.” Douglas mentioned that Kilmer  his co-star in that movie  was suffering from the same illness he had suffered from. Kilmer denied this  posting on Facebook that he had “no cancer whatsoever.” I asked Kilmer why he said he didn’t have cancer  when it seemed to me  judging by the fact that the thing he described is absolutely the treatment for throat cancer  that he perhaps definitely did. He said  “Because I didn’t have cancer.” I blinked a few times. “They said I was denying that I had cancer  and when they asked me  I didn’t have cancer. It was a bit like do you have a broken bone? And if you broke it in high school  you would say no.” He continued: “Suddenly suspect. I have had a bone broken  but why are you being so aggressive? I had a bone broken. It was broken in my leg. ‘Oh  so you have a broken leg.’ ‘No  no  I don’t ’ I say. I did have a broken leg.” It’s not exactly mind over matter. It is  he tells me  the lost art of Christian healing. ”‘There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so ’” he said  quoting Mrs. Eddy quoting “Hamlet.” “I prayed  and that was my form of treatment.” The doctors did those other things  but it was the prayer that worked  he’s sure. He is no longer suffering from cancer  he said. Or rather  he never was. No  he’s suffering from something quite different. He pointed at his trach tube. “That’s from radiation and chemotherapy. It’s not from cancer.” His prayer  he said  was the true treatment  the medical response to cancer was the thing that hurt him. “That ‘treatment’ caused my suffering.” The next day  Kilmer sat at a conference table in HelMel and opened up a red Igloo cooler and began to mix liquids together from various canisters before putting them into a syringe. He opened his shirt  uncapped his feeding port and injected the food into a tube. It was lunchtime. He has no vices anymore. He watches all the food shows — “Top Chef ” “Chef’s Table ” “Ugly Delicious” — yearning for the time he’ll be able to eat again  though it has been years and he’s not sure how much longer it will be. When it is  though  he said  making his arms into a food-shoveling gesture  “I’m going to look like Orson Welles.” He’s 61 now. He is still so handsome. His hair is still blond. His eyes are still the unimaginable green of Oregon grass right after the rain. His jaw is still the main event — the nasolabial area of his cheek bookending the inferior jowl so that his superior jowl appears sunken and his face takes on romantic geological proportions. He was wearing a very heavy turquoise and coral necklace that his mother  who died last year  wore for 20 years straight  along with her turquoise bracelet. He was never scared during his medical treatment  he told me  he never panicked. Right as he was graduating from high school  his younger brother  Wesley  who had received a diagnosis of epilepsy  drowned in the family’s Jacuzzi. Wesley had been a “supergenius ” he said  a gifted filmmaker who made stop-motion animation ahead of his time. But Kilmer still talks to Wesley. Wesley shows up in his office  and they hash things out or trade ideas. His mother has appeared to him lately  too  as if “she’s at a party  saying how happy she is to be with her husband again and Wesley  my little brother  so happy.” Death isn’t death in Christian Science. It’s simply that humans have limitations  and one of them is that we perceive people only through our five senses. When a person dies  they aren’t gone. They are just not showing up in our senses anymore. So if a Christian Scientist prays and still dies (according to standard definitions of death)  it doesn’t mean the prayer didn’t work. As Kilmer said when he was dressed up as Mark Twain  all prayers work: “It’s just that sometimes we don’t like the answer.” So how can you be scared of cancer when there’s no such thing as cancer? How can you fear death when there’s no such thing as death? The answer is you can’t. “Someone comes up to you and says you have only four months to live  and the concept of time is a human one. So  if you describe the divine concept of time  there is no time.” He’s been off the trach tube a couple of times  though each time  he has a setback: a cough  a cold  a fever. But why all this talk about the time that fear manifested in his body? He addressed it. He made it through that  and now he’s on the other side  and his life is finally what he wanted it to be. By the time I met him  he had taken “Citizen Twain” to more than 30 cities. “I feel like I could not possibly be in a better place for attracting better and better roles ” he said. “If an actor is fortunate enough to do so  to steer their own course and own their own material  they control their own destiny  creating their own products.” He talked about how Irwin Winkler and Francis Ford Coppola had each leveraged their wealth to get projects made. His slate these days is no different. “I haven’t picked subjects such as boxing  jealousy or uncontrollable madness. Mark Twain and Mary Baker Eddy are the subjects of the film I’ve dedicated 20 years of my life to  on and off.” He told me he’s filmed five roles so far this year. The opportunities are coming in the way they do only when you’re peaceful and not desperate about them. There’s a “Top Gun” sequel coming out this year. Kilmer is in it. He’s not allowed to say anything about the new “Top Gun” except that he’s in it. And that instead of being enemies with Maverick  their relationship has changed. “We’re friends ” he said. “This time we’re friends.” As I walked out of HelMel that day  Kilmer presented me with a gift: It was the abstract painting I admired the day before  with the swimmers diving into the waves. I told him I couldn’t take it — that Times policy was that I couldn’t accept anything even close to this. I put it down. He picked it up. I put it on a desk. He told Brad Koepenick  who stayed with us until the end of the interviews  to carry it out to my car and not let me leave without it. So I took it and put it in the passenger seat with a seatbelt around it  just me and Val Kilmer’s abstract swimmer art driving down Melrose  and honestly  I felt so good and so weightless — spending the day with someone who doesn’t believe in death is as fine an antidote to hearing all the stories of fear that were coming through the radio now as any — that instead of passing Cahuenga Boulevard back to my hotel  I hung a right and went to the movies  the way I used to when I was young. I sat in the movie theater  watching “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” and thinking of stories Kilmer told me: about an accident his daughter was in  how she was walking and got hit by a car on Little Santa Monica and then thrown through a storefront window  but the storefront had been evacuated and so was empty  and even though she’d gone through the glass  she emerged unscathed  about a time he was driving to the airport from his ranch and a car wandered through the median  and he was going too fast to stop  and so his car went through this other car without colliding with it. He can still see the mole on the driver’s neck as he went through him without causing material disturbance to either of their bodies or vehicles. These things happened because he’d been praying his whole life. But the other thing he’d been doing his whole life was telling these stories  turning the way we are constantly walking along the edge of our imminent demise — sure  imminent if you believe in time  demise if you believe in death — and trying to make sense of what could happen to a person at any given moment: a religious person  a person who is trying to be good in the world. That his daughter could be hit by a car? That he could die on the way to the airport? That his reputation could be shattered? That he could have a hole in his throat? Who could blame a person who needed to make sense of the chaotic turns of his life with a story? But even more: What else was he supposed to do? When he told me those stories  I told him it was hard for me to imagine that a person could heal themselves or prevent certain disaster with prayer. He said  “It’s not that difficult.” When he said that  I realized that as the days had gone on  it had become easier to understand him. The Times was calling for staff members to return to base and begin working from home  so I headed to the airport the next morning with my suitcase and my painting  which I promised myself I would mail back to Kilmer when I arrived at home. People were wearing masks on my flight and sanitizing the cups of soda they received during in-flight service  and I drifted off to sleep feeling bad for them. South by Southwest was canceled before I even landed. Cannes was postponed. Eventually  the Olympics were too. In the coming weeks  everything was canceled: school  outside  hugs. Peter Beard went missing  and Kilmer took a walk with Ali Alborzi  who was distraught. It was the longest walk Kilmer had taken in a long time  and he realized that two hummingbirds had been following him  had been following them for three days. “Birds have always been a part of my family ” Kilmer texted me. “Being the harbingers of life and the story of death.” He believed the hummingbirds had a message for them about Beard. By then  I thought  “How beautiful.” Perhaps we had created the coronavirus out of our fear and wickedness — children in cages  the rich hoarding wealth  perhaps we had only the suggestion of a virus. I grew up with too many messianics in my household. I found this kind of thing too easy to believe  if only because it was more believable than the fact that in 2020  my young  healthy colleagues were in the hospital  the streets were bare  I was stuck inside my house and nobody knew how long that might go on for. For a few days  I stared at my beautiful painting  which I will absolutely return when it’s safe to take a nonessential trip to the post office. It was so hard to parse all the fear that permeated society now — what was real and what had come as a result of our own hysteria. During the day I’d think that it was the fear that was hurting us most. But at night my husband would shake me to wake me up because I’d been crying in my sleep. More quickly than I could have imagined  the world took on the hallucinogenic quality of right before you fall asleep  when everything is outsize and nothing makes sense. The margins on my suspension of disbelief started to close in on themselves  and the borders of things began to diminish  and now the world seemed like a word you stare at so long that it becomes nonsense. I watched all the Val Kilmer movies again  but this time they struck me as representations of a world that never existed  that couldn’t possibly exist: What is sweaty shirtless fighter pilot? What is dentist with tuberculosis? What is Downtown L.A. shootout? What is Batmobile? What is Lizard King? Amid all this  I received a phone call. One of my closest and oldest friends  Lydia  called me to tell me she had throat cancer. I had seen her a few weeks before  and she told me she had been having bouts of laryngitis. But now she had a diagnosis. It was Stage 0 — it had not yet spread. I cried into the phone with her. But also here I was  finding this out while writing an article about a man who had throat cancer. I called up Kilmer and told him about Lydia. I asked if he had any advice to give her. He did. Kilmer told me she could “have a healing at any minute. It could happen right now  or when she’s on her way to the hospital  or even while a doctor is operating on her.” I called her and told her this  and it made us both giddy for some reason. But then  a few days later  her surgery was postponed because of the coronavirus  and we aren’t sure  even as of this writing  when it will happen  and now her cancer might spread. I felt stupid for trying to find meaning and hope in what was happening to Lydia  I felt stupid for trying to make this into a story for her and for us. In just two weeks  the palm trees against the bright blue sky that hung over HelMel seemed like something I made up  as weird to think about as a Batman figure with a Mark Twain head. (Was that even real? I searched my phone and found a picture of it. Phew.) By now I understood that the story I was telling about Val Kilmer  which I’d thought had been about a man’s relentless faith and optimism  was really about reconciliation: the squaring of two opposing things into something we swear is true despite all evidence to the contrary. Your beauty can sentence you to misery  Val Kilmer uses a tracheostomy tube  but he can talk  his brother is dead but only to our senses. Mark Twain despised Mary Baker Eddy  until you can will him into a dream where he doesn’t. God is good  and there are no ventilators. My beautiful friend has cancer  and the treatment exists  but it’s unavailable to her right now. Here’s the thing: Mark Twain  Kilmer’s favorite storyteller  thought that storytelling couldn’t (and shouldn’t) try to capture an entire life  to draw its arc  to determine its meaning. He was suspicious of the kind of autobiography that Ben Franklin had done. He thought it should just be a mishmash of remembrances told not even in the right order lest a person be tempted to force a story into a certain direction and make themselves a more sympathetic character than they deserve. Here’s another thing: I spoke to his daughter  Mercedes  who told me that she did have a miraculous recovery  but that a bone in her face had been broken and that she was in a wheelchair for a month and required major surgery. I spoke to Val Kilmer one more time. While we were on the phone  I stared at my painting  the divers diving in over and over — What is HelMel? What is ocean? — and I tried to remember how I felt when it was beside me in Los Angeles  in the passenger seat of the rental car. Kilmer told me that he and Alborzi were going to get in a car and drive to New Mexico  where he still has 160 acres of land. Meanwhile  Tom Cruise tweeted that the “Top Gun” sequel was moving to December  two of my colleagues were in the hospital and another’s husband lay in his bed gasping for breath. I attended a Zoom shiva for a friend’s mother  who was buried alone. Peter Beard lay in the woods  weeks away from being found. The Val Kilmer GIF snapped its jaw over and over forever in a text message. Lydia waited by the phone though she had not been told to expect a call  and Val Kilmer planned his road trip into the desert. None He was Batman. He was Iceman. Until he wasn’t.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/movies/matt-reeves-the-batman-tales-from-the-loop.html,Matt Reeves on ‘The Batman ’ ‘Tales From the Loop’ and Other Surreal Worlds Advertisement Supported by The filmmaker and producer talks about the personal stamp he tries to put on his work and what the comic-book vigilante has in common with “Klute.” None None None None In a phone interview on Tuesday  he said he was eager to get back to work while remaining mindful of more immediate priorities: “There are certain moments where you realize  OK  what do we have to do to make our loved ones and the people that we care about safe?” Reeves spoke further about the creation of “Tales From the Loop” and “The Batman” and the personal touch he tries to bring to his projects. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. Why did you decide to adapt a collection of paintings? There’s something incredibly cinematic about Simon’s vision. They’re filled with not only a sense of wonder but also a sense of melancholy. That’s exactly what we connected to. How did you then turn those paintings into a TV series? None None None Did you always want to make science fiction and fantasy? I came to genre kind of late. When I first began filmmaking  I thought I wanted to make humanist  Hal Ashby-type comedies. That opportunity didn’t really present itself for me. But then I discovered how the surface of genre can be a way to use metaphors to do very personal work. Can you bring a Hal Ashby touch to your big-budget tentpole movies? I’ve been incredibly lucky in each of the genre films I’ve done. The “Apes” films were very personal to me. When I came in on “Dawn ” my son was about 1 ½  and just starting to speak  and there was an urgency with which I could see that he had the intelligence to speak but not the actual facility yet. That was the way [Andy Serkis] played [Caesar  the intelligent chimpanzee]  he was aching to speak. There was something there about human nature and animal nature and the war between them. That was the thing that I really connected to. Is that really possible on a film like “The Batman ” where many masters have to be served? None What was it like to have a production of that size halted by a global pandemic? None When something like that happens  can you even begin to contemplate going back to work? Of course  [I want] to come back when the time is right. I’ve worked on a few things where  for various reasons  you have to stop for a moment — a cast member gets sick  and you have to shut down for a week. You can take stock of what you’ve done and prepare for what’s coming. I don’t think it’s a moment where I’m going  “Why aren’t we shooting?” I’m thinking  “There are bigger things.” Do you think the demand for this kind of escapism will be even greater when audiences are finally able to see it? I hope so. With “Tales ” and what we’re trying to do with “Batman ” is create just enough distance so that you can have the fantasy of saying  wow  what if I could experience that one impossible thing? You have a level of wish fulfillment. But it connects to your life in a way that doesn’t feel entirely like an escape. It can really touch you  but it gives you just enough distance that you don’t have to feel the pain of it too much. Advertisement ,articles/movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/books/robin-at-80.html,Batman and His Many Robins None The famous sidekick turns 80 on Friday. Many people have worn Robin’s costume over the years — and they were not all boy wonders. None Supported by None Robin  a.k.a. the Boy Wonder  celebrates his birthday this week: He made his debut in Detective Comics No. 38 on March 6  1940  and he and Batman became nearly inseparable in the war on crime. But while Bruce Wayne has nearly always worn Batman’s cowl  there have been many different characters behind Robin’s mask. Here is a look at some of the men and women who have called themselves Robin. 1940 First and foremost is Dick Grayson. Like Batman  Dick lost his family to crime. His parents  circus acrobats  were casualties in a mob-protection racket. Batman (Bruce Wayne) trained Dick to help bring the culprit to justice. The two orphans were a positive influence on each other. Over the next 40 years  Dick evolved from boy wonder to young adult. In his youth  he helped found the Teen Titans  a group of heroes who were sidekicks to the Justice League. During his time with the Titans  he realized he had outgrown his junior partner status. He became Nightwing in 1984 — and is still Nightwing today — though he has spent time in other tights. None 1955 Bruce Wayne once wore a Robin costume in his youth. He used the Robin identity to hide his own when he sought to apprentice with a famed detective named Harvey Harris. Many years later  Bruce learns he did not fool the detective  when a package and a letter arrive from Harris’s estate. “I realized that if you were aware I had learned your identity  you’d always feel insecure  so I never told you ” the letter states. “I was right  for you have become the greatest detective of all.” 1967 The concept of Earth-Two allowed for parallel versions of DC’s heroes to have been active from their first appearances in the 1930s and 1940s — and for them to age accordingly. In 1971  the contemporary Robin (then in college) met his older Earth-Two counterpart  who began his career in 1940  and who first met the Justice League in 1967. The older Robin wore a Batman-Robin hybrid costume that was a bit of an eyesore  and the two sidekicks bonded over feeling underestimated by the more seasoned heroes. By the end of this story  the younger Robin had a snazzy new costume lent to him by the elder one. (Unfortunately  it was not a permanent change.) But the elder Dick died wearing the better costume in 1985 during a story line meant to eliminate the parallel worlds. 1982 Dick thought he found a natural successor as Robin in Jason Todd  who was introduced in 1982. Like Dick  Jason was an acrobat who lost his parents to crime and helped Batman bring in the villain responsible for their deaths. Jason first wore the costume in 1983  though he dyed his hair black to try to pass himself off as the original Robin. In 1987  the back story of Batman and Robin and Jason was reset: After many years of fighting crime  Bruce and Dick (who at that point was nearly an adult) argued over the dangers of their line of work and dissolved their partnership. A few weeks later  Batman met Jason  reimagined as a young runaway  as he tried to steal the Batmobile’s tires. Somehow the Dark Knight decided Jason should be the next Robin. Holy Hypocrite  Batman! None 1986 A love interest of Bruce Wayne’s wore the Robin costume in 1941 to help the heroes on a case  but Carrie Kelley made a real splash as a female Robin in 1986. She was introduced in The Dark Knight Returns  which imagines a bleak future in which an older Bruce Wayne comes out of retirement to protect Gotham City. This story also planted the idea for Jason’s death in 1988. A Robin costume hangs in a memorial in the Batcave. Bruce looks at the display and thinks: “For Jason. Never. Never again.” 1989 There was a better reception for Tim Drake  who became Robin in 1989. A young Tim was at the circus the night Dick Grayson’s parents died. Several months later  Tim saw Robin on TV performing the same quadruple somersault that Dick performed at the circus along with his parents. Tim realized that Dick was Robin and began to obsessively follow the exploits of the Dynamic Duo. Following Jason’s death  Tim deduced that Batman was too reckless alone. He tried to convince Dick to return  but his critical assistance in a case made him the perfect successor. Tim now goes by the alter ego Drake. 2004 The next Robin was Stephanie Brown. She was the daughter of a villain known as the Cluemaster and helped foil his crimes as the Spoiler (her first code name). Stephanie temporarily replaced Tim in 2004 after Tim’s father discovered his extracurricular activities and forbade him from being Robin. Her tenure was short-lived  though  after she disobeyed Batman’s orders: In an attempt to prove her worth  she initiated a gang war in Gotham City with disastrous results  including sustaining seemingly fatal wounds. (Don’t worry  she got better.) 2006 None 2015 None Advertisement ,articles/movies

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/arts/television/zoe-kravitz-high-fidelity.html,Sooner or Later  Zoë Kravitz Was Going to Be a Star None It feels as if the 31-year-old actress has always been famous. But ‘High Fidelity’ and ‘The Batman’ are putting her at the center of the conversation. None Supported by None One afternoon in January  Zoë Kravitz was sitting in a sushi restaurant on the second floor of a Los Angeles strip mall  but her thoughts were 3 000 miles and 10 or so years away. Specifically she was thinking about her weed guy. None None “I did a lot of dumb stuff ” she said  but used a more pungent noun than “stuff.” “Fun stuff ” she said  “but dumb stuff. And was probably a really difficult person to be in a relationship with. But I think maybe any 21  22  23-year-old is.” Back in Los Angeles  the lunch crowd had mostly cleared out while Kravitz talked about living in New York  young and unfettered. None None “I really thought I was going to do theater and indie films ” she said. “That was what I liked growing up. And also  that was what I thought I was suited for. I didn’t see a lot of people who looked like me in big movies.” Just a few years ago  Kravitz — whose parents  the actress Lisa Bonet and the rocker/scarf influencer Lenny Kravitz  are both African-American and Jewish — had been discouraged from auditioning for a part in one of Christopher Nolan’s Batman films. Not by Nolan personally  she said. It wasn’t a Catwoman-size part. “It wasn’t like we were talking to the top of the top in terms of who was casting the thing ” she said  “But they said they weren’t ‘going urban.’ I thought that was really funny.” A lot has changed since — for Kravitz personally  and in the business as a whole. From Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie in Marvel’s cinematic universe to Halle Bailey’s Ariel in the forthcoming live-action “Little Mermaid” reboot  it’s become less unusual for actors of color to book roles not originally conceived with an actor of color in mind  particularly in comic-book and fantasy material  where parallel universes collide and anything is possible. (It’s worth noting that women of color have played Catwoman twice before  including Halle Berry in a somewhat infamous 2004 film.) None None None It didn’t bother her  she said  that the show never acknowledged that Bonnie was the only prominent person of color in the series’ otherwise monochromatic Northern California milieu. “In the first season  there was something really refreshing about not making that a story line ” she said. “It’s frustrating when people of color can only play a character that’s written as a minority ” she added. “So it’s refreshing when it’s not about that. But it’s complicated  because you don’t want to ignore that fact. Part of our responsibility as storytellers is to tell the truth.” She said she’d brought up ideas for Bonnie  ways to explore her position in the world of the show that felt truthful. “I pitched things  and it didn’t resonate with everybody and that’s OK ” she said  “It’s not like I didn’t have anything to do. Bonnie has a lot going on besides the fact that she’s a minority  you know? But that detail and that depth would have been delightful.” None Bonet rocketed to fame as Cliff and Clair Huxtable’s second daughter  and then lost that job — she had creative differences with Bill Cosby  beginning when he refused to write Bonet’s pregnancy with Zoë into the series. In an interview  Bonet said the move to the mountains was  at least in part  “a retreat from a world that I was probably unprepared for  at the age I was out there playing in it.” She also wanted to give her daughter a connection with nature and nurture her imagination. She was a limited-screen-time parent before “screen time” became a topic of widespread parental concern. They had a VCR and a collection of tapes — mostly stuff from Bonet’s childhood. “The Little Rascals.” The original “Freaky Friday ” with Jodie Foster. “Bugsy Malone ” a Prohibition-era gangster musical starring a cast of children. (“That was a big one for me ” Kravitz said.) Kravitz was always a performer  Bonet said. She remembered the night of her mother’s funeral  when Kravitz favored family members gathered at the Topanga house with a song — “The Boy Is Mine ” by Brandy and Monica. “Zoë put a suit on — I think she had a mustache and glasses — and came out and brought so much joy to the whole room ” Bonet said. “No one told her what to do — it was just pure  from her imagination  with the intention to lift the spirits in the room.” Kravitz would have been around 9 when this happened. At 11  she relocated to Miami to live with her father  who’d long since shed the Romeo Blue moniker and become one of the biggest rock stars of the age. There are different stories about how Zoë Kravitz’s move to Miami happened  depending on whom you ask. “There was a whole seduction ” Bonet said  “to a life outside of living in the mountains  with just a monitor and a VCR  compared to screens in every room and private chefs and a big house. There was no real conversation  not between her father and I. But it was necessary. She needed to find out who her father was  and that was the way.” Lenny Kravitz recalled the situation somewhat differently. “She wanted to live with me ” he said  “and I wanted to have her. It was time. And as a family  we made the decision together.” “It really helped me to focus my life ” he said. “I was running around the world touring  man … I had to make some lifestyle changes.” Still  life with Lenny Kravitz came with no shortage of rock-star perks. He shared a label with the Spice Girls at the time  one year Zoë sat with them at the Grammy Awards. “I don’t remember if it was Scary or Victoria ” Lenny said  “but she was sitting on one of their laps  and she was in heaven.” None Some time after moving to Miami  Zoë Kravitz told her father that she wanted to act. “My mom wanted me to wait until I was an adult to start working ” she said  but her dad felt differently. “I’m a person who left home at 15 ” Lenny Kravitz said. “I would do nothing but support my child in what she wanted to do  absolutely. And it was her decision.” What everyone seems to be able to agree on is that this would have happened no matter what — that sooner or later Zoë Kravitz would be doing what she’s doing right now. “I mean  look  she’s a mad artist ” Shailene Woodley said in a phone interview. “Zoë’s constantly looking at the world around her  thinking  ‘How can I leave this place better than it was when I got here? How can I continue to use my talents and gifts as a singer  as a writer  as an actor in a way that’s meaningful and impactful for future generations and have fun doing it?’” Woodley was calling from London  while preparing for a dinner party. Even as the sound of arriving guests became audible over the phone  she kept on singing her friend’s praises. None Zoë Kravitz is an executive producer of “High Fidelity” as well as its star  and the show — funny and poignant and surprisingly personal — feels like a product of the sensibility that Woodley described. Kravitz  who attended high school in New York and has fond memories of loitering after school in grubby record shops like Kim’s Video and Music  the bygone East Village institution  said she’d long been a fan of the book and particularly of Stephen Frears’ film version from 2000  which starred John Cusack as Rob and Lisa Bonet as a singer with whom he rebounds. “For some reason ” she said  “‘High Fidelity’ was one of the few pieces of art that my parents had been a part of that I was really able to separate from them. It’s a weird thing  because it can be really uncomfortable and strange watching your mom kiss John Cusack or whatever  but it became a film that I loved and watched and could quote.” Sarah Kucserka  who developed the Hulu series with Veronica West  said when they brainstormed leads  “the top of the list — pie in the sky  it’s never going to happen — was Zoë.” Kucserka noted  “She has a lot of depth  and that was what this character needed. You couldn’t come at it with someone who only brought one thing to the party.” Hornby was only dimly aware that a TV version of “High Fidelity” was in the works. But last year  Kravitz asked if they could meet. “She seemed to have a lot invested in it ” Hornby said  “and was restless in her urge to get it as close to what she wanted as she could.” She asked for  and received  his blessing. “One of the things I’m most proud of about the book ” Hornby said  “is that — I’ve realized this more and more over the years — it’s not just about me. It’s not just about people like me. It’s about way more people than I thought.” In the initial script  the main character lived in Los Angeles and would have worked at a radio station. Kravitz proposed moving it to New York  and into a dusty basement record shop. Those choices  she said  helped determine other aspects of the show  like setting the story in Crown Heights  a part of Brooklyn where a dusty basement record shop and its owner could realistically survive. (Kravitz  who married the actor Karl Glusman last June  has lived in Williamsburg for more than 10 years  long enough to watch gentrification transform it  her favorite bagel shop is now an Apple Store.) The staff of the record store now consists of two women of color (Kravitz’s Rob and Da’Vine Joy Randolph of “Dolemite Is My Name”) and a shy  gay man (David Holmes). When Rob runs down her top five heartbreaks in flashback  the list includes women as well as men. None of this  Kravitz said  was about clearing some imaginary bar for wokeness. They just wanted a cast that looked real. “I was trying to recreate a world that I know ” Kravitz said  “and that’s what it looks like. It doesn’t look like a bunch of white girls  like the show ‘Girls ’” whose portrayal of New York-area hipsterdom struck many viewers — Kravitz included — as demographically specious. “If that show was in Iowa or something  fine  but you’re living in Brooklyn ” she said. “There’s people of color everywhere. It’s unavoidable. Same thing with Woody Allen — like  how do you not have black people in your movies? It’s impossible. They’re everywhere. We’re everywhere. I’m sorry  but we’re everywhere.” None This kind of conversation is good practice — Kravitz is about to fly to London and shoot a movie in which she plays an iconic comic-book character  and she’s aware that any attachment “High Fidelity” fans may have to an idea of Rob Gordon pales in comparison to the proprietary feelings contemporary nerddom harbors regarding Batman. “As long as I don’t allow it to get in the way of what I need to do to find this character and make her my own  so that it can be as authentic as possible  I welcome all the fans and their opinions and their love for this world ” she said  with a diplomatic smile.

https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/gotham-recap-batman-before-batman/,"‘Gotham’ Recap: ‘Batman’ Before Batman Season 1  Episode 1 Activate the Spoiler Signal! None None Recaps of the Fox crime drama. Billed as a “new chapter” of the saga  the “Gotham” premiere on Monday opened on a comely young pickpocket  who did parkour and fed alley cats (hmmmm…) before witnessing the brutal
                                        murder of a well-heeled couple in front of their young son. The victims are  of course  the billionaire couple Thomas and Martha Wayne and their 12-year-old boy is Bruce  the future caped crusader. And while there’s something numbingly dutiful about the stylized slaying
                                        and the ensuing roll out of future villains — Hey  that quirky forensics guy sure likes riddles! — if you have any “Batman” sympathies at all  you can feel it working on you. When a robust
                                        young Alfred “The Butler” Pennyworth shows up at the crime scene to put an arm around his freshly orphaned charge  the little thrill is almost enough to carry you through the cop-show clichés
                                        to come. And Holy Procedural  Batman  do they come. The protagonist of “Gotham” is James “the future Commissioner” Gordon  an upright rookie detective portrayed with a suitable earnestness by Ben
                                        McKenzie  of “Southland” fame. He and Harvey Bullock  his Grizzled Partner (played by Donal Logue)  catch the case  of course  and proceed to bicker with each other and with competing cops  while rousting
                                        petty crooks  and chasing a perp across roofs and down fire escapes before putting him down. Hooray! The Wayne case is cracked! Or is it? You’ve seen such tropes a thousand times  but from Fox’s perspective  at least  they’re a big plus for “Gotham.” For a sizable portion of the TV audience  this sort of diversion is
                                        televisual pizza: even the worst doesn’t taste all that bad and will do just fine after a hard day’s work. None As for the inevitable twists of the pilot  let’s give them a B-plus. The easily solved Wayne case was a frame-up  naturally  but the revelation that Bullock was in on it surprised me. He’s clearly a crooked
                                        mess but seemed like the sort of rough-around-the-edges rummy cop whose omnipresent silver flask probably hid a heart of gold. (It may still go that way — the character has followed several divergent arcs
                                        in the comic books — but I hope not.) None None Based on the one episode  Mr. McKenzie seems like a good choice for Gordon. He tends to have two speeds as an actor — wary skepticism and righteous intensity — and as Gordon  he spends most of the episode
                                        alternating between both of them. Mr. McKenzie  who though at 36 is no longer the angry young man you might remember from “The O.C. ” nevertheless retains something of the callow outsider  a quality
                                        that should nicely accent Gordon’s ongoing education into the seamy underbelly of Gotham City. His virtue seems authentic: You believe that he believes his promise to Baby Batman to avenge the murder of his
                                        parents. It’s the beginning of a friendship  we’re told by the publicity materials  that “will last them all of their lives  playing a crucial role in helping the young boy eventually become
                                        the crusader he’s destined to be.” David Mazouz is great as the young Bruce  and manages to seem both haughtily precocious and deeply damaged. There’s also something going on with Gordon’s fiancée  Barbara Kean (Erin Richards)  who
                                        is a former … something to Renee Montoya (Victoria Cartagena)  one of Gordon’s cop enemies. None As for the writing … well  pilots are clunky. Even new chapters of well-known stories require some basic outlining of relationships and narrative context. Still  it was dispiriting to see Mr. Logue  an appealing
                                        actor capable of great nuance  swilling antacid from the bottle and growling about turf at rival cops like a hundred other unshaven detectives of yore. But “Gotham” becomes legitimately interesting when it subtly subverts its baked-in strengths. While “Batman” taps your inner vigilante — the part that thinks when things get bad enough 
                                        sometimes you have to break a few rules — in “Gotham” we’re being asked to identify with the police. Sure  it comes out that the department is mostly corrupt. But our hero  Gordon 
                                        is a strong moral character who aims to fix a broken system from within  not from the shadows or some underground super-lair. Which leads to an intriguing paradox at the heart of “Gotham”: Gordon can’t win. Because if he was able to root out and squash all the crooked cops and the crime lords who own them — to say
                                        nothing of the nutters to come — then who would need a masked crusader with abandonment issues to mete out justice in a lawless city? None All of which means that “Gotham” may be a cop show in which the cops will mostly oversee the collapse of their city into disorder. “War is coming ” the Penguin says toward the end of the
                                        episode. “There will be chaos  blood in the streets.” I’m looking forward to all of it. A FEW THOUGHTS WHILE WE LOOK FOR OUR MONOCLE None • I’ve skipped the common complaint about comic-book culture taking over adult popular entertainment because  let’s be honest  that Batship sailed a long time ago. There are lots of channels. While
                                        “Gotham” occasionally dipped into the sort of undergrad self-seriousness that plagues many of even the best comics  the EPM (Eyerolls Per Minute) rate felt low here.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/movies/ben-affleck-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-interview.html,Ben Affleck’s ‘Broken’ Batman Advertisement Supported by None SANTA MONICA  Calif. — On the morning of the Academy Awards  Ben Affleck was at my hotel door. He entered with neither the swagger of Bruce Wayne nor the bravado of Batman  just with a quiet apology for postponing this conversation  planned for the day before  when he said he’d come down with a migraine. “It would have been a delirious interview ” he said through a hangdog smile. “I don’t know that it would have been good for either one of us.” This is a feverish  perplexing time for Mr. Affleck  43  as strange as seeing him stuff his brawny  6-foot-4-inch frame into a cramped room  flop into a chair and stretch his legs across my bed. Consider the contradictory strands of his life and career that are coinciding for him  and you may find yourself envying  pitying and disliking him all at once. None None None None “It never seems like a great time to have your privacy invaded ” Mr. Affleck said warily. “Obviously this is a particularly hard time.” None In person  Mr. Affleck was friendly and funny  but also soft-spoken and vulnerable. At times he seemed anxious and out of sorts  as if waiting for some other shoe to drop. Despite vowing not to  he did eventually address Ms. Garner’s Vanity Fair profile. And though he said he could not pinpoint why he chose to play Batman right now  he did offer a broader theory on the parts that currently appeal to him. When he watches other movies that strain to make their protagonists likable and valorous  Mr. Affleck said: “I find that boring. Instead  I think it’s interesting how we manage the best version of ourselves  despite our flaws and our weaknesses and our sometime tendencies to do the wrong thing.” He has also realized that for all of his Hollywood success  some part of him will always feel like a relentless striver who must prove  through his work  that he has a right to be there. “That never goes away ” he said. “All these habits that we develop  that help us at some point  they have flip sides. In this case  it’s hard to turn that feeling off.” Addressing himself  he added  “It’s O.K. to just chill for a second.” None In sizing up a possible adversary for Superman to fight in a sequel  Mr. Snyder said he found himself irresistibly drawn to Batman  particularly one who is older and more seasoned than in past movies. “I wanted a Batman who had been Batman for 20 years ” he explained  “a war-weary Batman.” “When you start thinking about the actors in that range  we came to Ben pretty quickly ” Mr. Snyder said  noting Mr. Affleck’s muscular build and lantern-like jaw. “He’s a big guy. I’ve always been a fan of a large Batman.” Mr. Affleck  his hair now streaked with gray  and his forearms bulging through T-shirt sleeves to reveal hints of red-and-yellow tattoo ink on one biceps  said he was not interested in a “down-the-middle version” of the hero. But he was won over by Mr. Snyder’s presentation — further emphasized in a revision of the script by Chris Terrio  the Oscar-winning screenwriter of “Argo” — of Batman as a vengeful vigilante still haunted by the murders of his parents. Having seen the devastation already brought to Metropolis  he is driven to extremes by his fear of the further havoc Superman could wreak. “He’s living in this gray zone ” Mr. Affleck said of his Batman. “He’s more broken  not slick. He’s filling the hole in his soul with these increasingly morally questionable nighttime excursions — fighting crime as well as by being this playboy.” With a chuckle  he added: “You wonder  is this healthy?” Mr. Affleck’s “Batman v Superman” co-stars spoke respectfully about his portrayal of a melancholy caped crusader. Henry Cavill  who plays Superman  said: “There’s some real pain buried in there  in the soul of this Batman  yet it’s covered with scar tissue. There’s some bitterness  which  if dealt with poorly  can go down a bad road.” Jeremy Irons  who plays Bruce Wayne’s loyal aide  Alfred  said that beneath all the special effects and high-tech trappings of the film  Mr. Affleck seemed drawn to the mythical  larger-than-life qualities of the title champions. “They do represent big  emotional ideas that stand behind America as a country ” Mr. Irons said. “I think a man like Ben needs to feel that he’s not just earning parts  but he’s actually telling a story that is worth mentioning.” Mr. Affleck said he took the role partly to please his 4-year-old son  Samuel  who is already a loyal Bat-fan. “He knows that I am Batman ” Mr. Affleck said. “It’s a mixed blessing. He also thinks that for some reason — I don’t know if it’s the color combination or whatever — that the FedEx guy is the Joker.” None But Mr. Terrio  the screenwriter  suggested that there were deeper connections between Mr. Affleck and Bruce Wayne  a man who is essentially playing a role in public but who becomes someone different in the safety of his Batcave. “There is performativity in Ben’s life  as there is with any person who is a public figure ” Mr. Terrio said. “You have to go on talk shows and be a charming person and seem at ease in the world ” he said. “But if you’re a serious artist who thinks carefully about things  as I think Ben is  then there has to be the cave side to you  where you go home  and the world is not so effortless and charming and black and white.” “Argo ” about a C.I.A. operative who seeks Hollywood’s help to rescue Americans in Iran  was also a story about a character reckoning with false fronts and deception. “You need to  sometimes  take a moment to remember who you are  before you go back to your family ” Mr. Terrio said. None None (As for any further Batman movies  Mr. Affleck said  “If there comes a point that I want to do Batman  and there’s a script and it works  then I’ll do it.”) Warner Bros.  which will release “Live by Night” and “The Accountant” (and also handled “Argo” and “The Town”)  said that Mr. Affleck’s comic-book duties were not any kind of quid pro quo for the films he directs. “We’re in the Ben Affleck business ” said Sue Kroll  president for worldwide marketing and distribution at Warner Bros. Pictures. “He needs to be able to do what he needs to do to thrive as an artist. His schedule is clearly a very aggressive one  and we have him very busy.” Mr. Affleck brushed off his professional relentlessness as “high-class problems ” then added  more soberly  that he often finds himself walking a self-imposed boundary between working too much and feeling that he is not working enough. In those idle moments  he said: “I get antsy. I’m my own worst enemy in that way.” Slapping his hand in his palm for emphasis  Mr. Affleck added  “You’ve got to realize  this line of work  it’s rooted in a feeling of needing to audition all the time.” None When he is writing and directing his own movies  Mr. Affleck said he feels “so much anxiety every day on the set.” “The urge of making it good and trying to make sure that it works  that you’ve done the most interesting version that you can — it’s like a neurosis that drives me to work every day ” he said. The relief of a project like “Batman v Superman ” for all its complications  Mr. Affleck said  is that he is simply another director’s actor. “If there’s clearly some problem over there ” he said  “I’m just so happy to leave those people to it and be able to go home when my scene’s finished.” Home would hardly seem like a refuge for Mr. Affleck right now  not while the particulars of his relationship with Ms. Garner are being publicly dissected  and not after Ms. Garner’s Vanity Fair interview  which  for all its affection toward him  depicts him as an absent and enigmatic husband. “I’m still the only person that knows some of his truths ” she said in the article. (She denied that Mr. Affleck had broken up their marriage by trysting with a family nanny.) Mr. Affleck said at first that he does not publicly discuss his family for the sake of his three children and “because it ends up being in the record somewhere  in the great miasma of junk on the Internet.” Asked if Ms. Garner had made that impossible by sharing intimate details of their lives  he said: “Jen’s great. She’s a great person. We’re on great terms. I just saw her this morning  so that’s the reality that I live in.” Whatever anyone might conclude from her interview  Mr. Affleck said Ms. Garner and their children plan to visit him during the filming of “Justice League” so they can vacation in Europe as a family. “She felt like she wanted to discuss it and get it out there and get it over with ” he said  “so she could say  ‘Look  I already talked about it — I don’t want to do it again.’” He added: “It’s fine. She’s allowed to talk about it.” Still  there would seem to be a point at which Mr. Affleck’s recent string of morally compromised screen characters — deficient spouses in “Argo” and “Gone Girl ” even a caddish  love-’em-and-leave-’em Bruce Wayne in “Batman v Superman” — becomes inseparable from how audiences perceive him. Beyond that threshold  perhaps  Hollywood can see him only as his bad-boy facades  rather than as the person he says he is out of view of the cameras. None “It’s the way Ricky Gervais perceives me  I suppose ” he said  laughing. “Whatever. I’ve had jokes made at my expense before. It’s part of the deal.” Mr. Affleck acknowledged that he cannot portray questionable characters onscreen and come away from them as cleanly as some of his peers. “Denzel Washington can play almost anybody — mass murderers — and you go  ‘But he’s all right!’” he said. “There’s something so appealing about him  and I don’t think I have that. “You have these qualities that you’re born with. Some of them are good  some of them people don’t like. And you just have to live with it.” When our conversation was seemingly at its end  Mr. Affleck and I stood up to say our goodbyes. But then  without prompting  he said he wanted to add a further point about his pride in “Batman v Superman ” and how it outweighed “the other stuff  my personal life stuff.” “The whole lesson of my career has been that what’s really important is the work you do ” he said. “Even in the tough spots  if your movies are good  people will see them. And if you’re not good  you can’t get away with it. “Eventually it catches up to you. Both ways  good and bad.” Advertisement ,articles/movies
